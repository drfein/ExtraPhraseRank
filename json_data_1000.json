{"document": ["Recent reports have linked some France-based players with returns to Wales.\n\"I've always felt - and this is with my rugby hat on now; this is not region or WRU - I'd rather spend that money on keeping players in Wales,\" said Davies.\nThe WRU provides \u00a32m to the fund and \u00a31.3m comes from the regions.\nFormer Wales and British and Irish Lions fly-half Davies became WRU chairman on Tuesday 21 October, succeeding deposed David Pickering following governing body elections.\nHe is now serving a notice period to leave his role as Newport Gwent Dragons chief executive after being voted on to the WRU board in September.\nDavies was among the leading figures among Dragons, Ospreys, Scarlets and Cardiff Blues officials who were embroiled in a protracted dispute with the WRU that ended in a \u00a360m deal in August this year.\nIn the wake of that deal being done, Davies said the \u00a33.3m should be spent on ensuring current Wales-based stars remain there.\nIn recent weeks, Racing Metro flanker Dan Lydiate was linked with returning to Wales.\nLikewise the Paris club's scrum-half Mike Phillips and centre Jamie Roberts were also touted for possible returns.\nWales coach Warren Gatland has said: \"We haven't instigated contact with the players.\n\"But we are aware that one or two of them are keen to return to Wales sooner rather than later.\"\nSpeaking to Scrum V on BBC Radio Wales, Davies re-iterated his stance, saying keeping players such as Scarlets full-back Liam Williams and Ospreys flanker Justin Tipuric in Wales should take precedence.\n\"It's obviously a limited amount of money [available]. The union are contributing 60% of that contract and the regions are putting \u00a31.3m in.\n\"So it's a total pot of just over \u00a33m and if you look at the sorts of salaries that the... guys... have been tempted to go overseas for [are] significant amounts of money.\n\"So if we were to bring the players back, we'd probably get five or six players.\n\"And I've always felt - and this is with my rugby hat on now; this is not region or WRU - I'd rather spend that money on keeping players in Wales.\n\"There are players coming out of contract, perhaps in the next year or so\u2026 you're looking at your Liam Williams' of the world; Justin Tipuric for example - we need to keep these guys in Wales.\n\"We actually want them there. They are the ones who are going to impress the young kids, for example.\n\"They are the sort of heroes that our young kids want to emulate.\n\"So I would start off [by saying] with the limited pot of money, we have to retain players in Wales.\n\"Now, if that can be done and there's some spare monies available at the end, yes, let's look to bring players back.\n\"But it's a cruel world, isn't it?\n\"It's fine to take the buck and go, but great if you can get them back as well, provided there's enough money.\"\nBritish and Irish Lions centre Roberts has insisted he will see out his Racing Metro contract.\nHe and Phillips also earlier dismissed the idea of leaving Paris.\nRoberts also admitted being hurt by comments in French Newspaper L'Equipe attributed to Racing Coach Laurent Labit questioning their effectiveness.\nCentre Roberts and flanker Lydiate joined Racing ahead of the 2013-14 season while scrum-half Phillips moved there in December 2013 after being dismissed for disciplinary reasons by former club Bayonne.", "Army explosives experts were called out to deal with a suspect package at the offices on the Newtownards Road on Friday night.\nRoads were sealed off and traffic diverted as a controlled explosion was carried out.\nThe premises, used by East Belfast MP Naomi Long, have been targeted a number of times.\nMost recently, petrol bomb attacks were carried out on the offices on consecutive nights in April and May.\nThe attacks began following a Belfast City Council vote in December 2012 restricting the flying of the union flag at the City Hall.\nCondemning the latest hoax, Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle said: \"It is a serious incident for the local area, it causes serious disruption, it puts people's lives at risk, it can prevent emergency services reaching the area.\n\"Ultimately we need people with information to share that with the police in order for them to do their job and bring these people to justice.\"", "It has lost its previous triple-A rating from the World Energy Council (WEC) - a global body representing the energy sector.\nThe authors of the WEC report said a vacuum in energy policy since the election was deterring investors needed to create new electricity supplies.\nBut the government said it was still a world leader in energy policy.\nIt said it was committed to securing energy supplies through nuclear and shale gas.\nThe criticism from the WEC follows a complaint from the UN's chief environment scientist that the UK was turning away from renewables, just as they were being embraced by the rest of the world in the run-up to Paris climate talks this month.\nThe WEC report ranks countries on their policies to keep the lights on, bills and carbon emissions down. It says the UK has been a leader in these policies.\nBut its says the government's drastic withdrawal of subsidies for wind and solar power has deterred investors needed for new energy supplies.\nElectricity has become comparatively more expensive, and the UK remains on a \"watch-list\" over how it will secure its future energy supply.\nThe report warned the UK faced the run-down of nuclear plants and the closure of coal-powered stations, alongside ageing infrastructure - meaning its ranking is set to fall in future assessments.\nIt urged the government to ensure consistent policy to secure and maintain investments while reforms to the energy system are being implemented.\nBritain still gets an AAB rating from the council and is still in the world's top four. But that may be a let-off, because the report was written before damaging revelations in a leaked letter that the government has misled people over its progress on EU renewable energy targets.\nThe government denies misleading Parliament to believe that it will hit its mandatory 15% renewable energy target in 2020.\nBut the letter makes clear that the shortfall of approaching 25% in renewables has been hidden from the public - and over several summer months in which subsidies were being cut, journalists were consistently told that the EU renewables targets were still being met.\nEnergy Secretary Amber Rudd told MPs the government remained committed to the targets, which will be achieved by greater focus on renewable heat and transport, rather than electricity.\nShe added: \"I recognise, as that letter does, that we don't have the right policies, particularly in transport and heat in order to make those 2020 targets, but we have four to five years and I remain committed to making those targets.\"\nA spokesman for her department, commenting on the WEC report, said: \"We've made record investments in renewables and are committed to lower-carbon secure energy, such as nuclear and shale gas, which will help keep the lights on for future generations.\"\nEnergy analysts are baffled as to why the government is blocking onshore wind and large-scale solar power, as these are among the cheapest options for hitting the renewables target.\nThe UN praises the UK for its international role on climate, especially in helping developing countries get clean energy supplies like wind and solar.\nBut the head of the climate negotiations said she noted concern among international allies over recent UK policy changes.\nFollow Roger Harrabin on Twitter @rharrabin", "The warning begins at 22:00 GMT on Saturday and ends at 10:00 on Sunday.\nThe ice could lead to difficult driving conditions on untreated roads and slippery conditions on pavements, the weather service warned.\nOnly the southernmost counties and parts of the most westerly counties are expected to escape.\nCounties expected to be affected are Carmarthenshire, Powys, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Wrexham, Conwy, Flintshire, Anglesey, Monmouthshire, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly, Merthyr Tydfil, Neath Port Talbot, Rhondda Cynon Taff and Torfaen.", "Tony Fisher's body was found by his son in Coningswath Road in Carlton, Nottingham, on 9 January.\nJaydon Robert Barton and Nathan Barton, both 22, were charged with murder and appeared in court on Saturday.\nMarcus Barton, 41, was charged with Mr Fisher's murder in January and remains in custody.\nVincent Hawkins, 32, of Handel Street, Nottingham, has also been charged with assisting an offender and will appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court alongside Jaydon and Nathan Barton.\nDetectives believe Mr Fisher, 58, was \"targeted\" because it was thought he had a \"large amount of money in the house\".\nMarcus Barton, of Raymede Drive, Bestwood, who also goes by the name Marcus Pegg, is due to appear at Nottingham Crown Court on 13 May.\nNottinghamshire Police said officers have arrested a total of 18 people during their investigation.\nAside from the four people charged, one 42-year-old man remains on bail pending further enquiries. All others have been released without charge.", "Lam, 28, joined the club in 2014 and, despite missing out on promotion to the Premiership, the Samoa forward has ignored interest elsewhere to re-sign.\nHe says the challenge of getting the club into the top flight was one he could not walk away from after their play-off loss to Worcester in May.\n\"I feel I've got unfinished business here,\" Lam told BBC Radio Bristol.\n\"There is a lot of talent here and massive potential at the club and I'll probably see my years out here. I couldn't see myself leaving the club and not helping them get up into the top flight.\n\"I've made some really good friendships in the team, the supporters are unreal and playing at Ashton Gate is a top facility.\"\nLam, who was part of Samoa's World Cup squad, says he could have signed elsewhere but ultimately thinks he will end his career at the club.\n\"I got a couple of approaches from other clubs but I couldn't see myself leaving having not helped them get promoted,\" he said. \"Bristol is a home away from home and everyone here has made me feel very welcome.\n\"I'm not getting any younger, two more years takes me up to 30 and then I'll have to start thinking about what I do after rugby. There are not too many years left in me and I'd like to see my years out at Bristol.\"\nAnd Lam, who has scored 12 tries in 17 appearances, says securing promotion would be one of the greatest achievements of his career.\n\"It would be massive, you go through a career without any silverware, that would hopefully be my first and it'll be one of biggest achievements in my rugby career,\" he added.", "The 59-year-old, who missed out on the England job in 2012, was approached by the RFU after the World Cup in 2015.\nNo European side made the semi-finals of the World Cup, with New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina reaching the last four.\n\"I think it is a mindset thing,\" said South African Mallett.\n\"Teams will have learned after the World Cup that in order to win major events, you have to be very effective in attack,\" he told BBC Radio 5 live.\nWhy do Six Nations teams lag behind?\n\"In the final game of the Six Nations last year, when teams were forced to score points to win the competition, we saw three absolutely brilliant games [featuring 27 tries], which weren't replicated in the World Cup by any of the northern hemisphere teams.\"\n\"Four years away from a World Cup, [you need] to develop a game plan to match New Zealand, Australia or Argentina going into 2019,\" he said.\nMallett, a former Springbok international, coached South Africa to a record-breaking run of victories in 1998, and was in charge of Italy from 2007 to 2011.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHe is working as a rugby statistical analyst with Accenture during the Six Nations, and the numbers from last season's championship are revealing. In the Wales against Ireland match in Cardiff, Ireland carried a substantial 415 metres, but only scored 16 points. This is a problem that needs addressing, according to Mallett.\n\"You have to create try-scoring opportunities, which northern hemisphere teams haven't done,\" he said.\n\"Ireland against Wales in the Six Nations last year, I remember clearly a period when Ireland hammered away around the fringes with their wide players completely and utterly unmarked. You would never see New Zealand making that mistake.\"\nHowever, Mallett does feel northern hemisphere sides have the potential to match their southern counterparts.\n\"Weather really makes a massive difference to how you play the game, but if you go in with a positive intent - as all the teams did on the final weekend of the Six Nations last year - then we can see northern hemisphere sides playing the same style as southern hemisphere teams, and being more of a challenge to those teams at the next World Cup.\"\nMallett was beaten to the England job by Stuart Lancaster in 2012, and was again approached by the RFU before Eddie Jones was appointed as Lancaster's successor.\nMallett continued: \"The RFU chose Stuart Lancaster for very good reasons, they felt he understood England and understood the team and they wanted to give an England coach an opportunity.\n\"I've said all along I would have loved to have had the opportunity because I had [former All Blacks coach] Wayne Smith who was keen to do it with me.\"\nWith Smith currently taking a sabbatical from coaching, Mallett declared himself unavailable this time round, with Eddie Jones appointed to the role in November.\n\"It's interesting to see now how England went quickly for an experienced international coach,\" Mallett added.\n\"I think he will do well, he's certainly entertaining. Eddie Jones has had success, but he's also had poor stints. Every coach has his ups and downs and there are no guarantees.\"\nHowever, the South African believes England will finally be crowned Six Nations champions in 2016, if they can prevail at Murrayfield on the opening weekend.\n\"If England beat Scotland, they have Italy and then two games at home. I'm predicting England will be the strongest side, because of the draw and the enthusiasm which a new captain and coach brings,\" he said.\nHear more from Nick Mallett on 5 live Sport's Six Nations preview, Thursday evening from 19:00 GMT.\nFor the latest rugby union news follow @bbcrugbyunion on Twitter or sign up to the new  rugby alerts service available on the BBC Sport app.", "Well today we got our answer. As the announcement came through from Buenos Aires, venues across the city burst into uproar.\nI was at the Komazawa Gymnasium in the west of the city where a couple of thousand Olympic enthusiasts had stayed up all night. Japanese people are, by nature, quite reticent, but not this morning. As Jacques Rogge read out the name of the winning city they went berserk, jumping and shouting, crying and laughing.\nA few hours later, standing in the rain in Shibuya, the city's busiest shopping district, I questioned early morning shoppers coming out of the train station. The ecstasy may have been more subdued, but the sentiment was the same.\nHard as I tried I couldn't find anyone who thought it was a bad idea. So much for my journalistic cynicism.\nEconomists say Tokyoites have good reason to be cheerful. There's a lot of building to be done, and a lot of money to be spent.\nLike any Olympics, the centrepiece will be an extravagant stadium. Tokyo's has been designed by British architect Zaha Hadid. Its futuristic curves fit nicely with Tokyo's Olympic slogan: \"Discover Tomorrow.\"\nBut it comes at a huge price: more than $1.5bn.  That is just a small part of the $8bn that will be spent on refurbishing old stadiums and building new ones. So it's all good news for Japan's construction companies, who have long been suckled on the teat of government spending.\nBut all this money going it to Tokyo may be less good news for other parts of the country, particularly the Tsunami ravaged north-east coast. In many areas re-construction has still barely begun.\nAnd then there are the people of Fukushima. A friend of mine who was born there could hardly contain her fury this week when she heard Japan's Olympic committee chief Tsunekazu Takeda reassuring the IOC about Fukushima.\n\"Fukushima is a long way away,\" he said. \"It is no threat to Tokyo.\"\n\"No threat to Tokyo maybe,\" my friend said. \"But what about the people who live in Fukushima?\"\nAbout 100,000 people are still unable to go home because of the nuclear disaster that struck the Fukushima Daiichi plant more than two-and-a-half years ago. Many feel that the rest of Japan is already forgetting about them, and that the Japanese government only cares about getting the other nuclear power plants back on line.\nIf there is one positive thing for the people of Fukushima to come from the Olympic decision, it is that the world is now watching even more closely to see what goes on there. The Japanese government has seven years to contain and neutralise the disaster properly.", "Thompson, 43, has worked alongside Clark at Birmingham and Blackpool.\n\"He has a great knowledge of the game and, coupled with the staff who are already here, I am looking forward to working with them all,\" said Clark.\nSaturday's 2-1 win at Chesterfield was Clark's first game in charge after he left Scottish club Kilmarnock to join League One Bury on Wednesday.", "Unidentified perpetrators in Mainhausen near Offenbach had bricked it up during the night, police told local media.\nIt could have been built within minutes, they said, and the motive is unclear - possibly a joke, an act of revenge, or a bet.\nPolice are searching for several people.

The drug was first introduced here in 1967. By the early 1980s, there were fears that the drug might be a factor in birth defects, including spina bifida, but prescription rules were only finally tightened in 2014.\nFrance is now working out the damage caused during this long period. Families of children with birth defects want to know why it took so long for this country's authorities to identify the serious risks associated with taking the drug during pregnancy.\nAccording to the new report (in French) by France's National Agency for the Safety of Medicines (ANSM), between 2,150 and 4,100 children suffered severe malformations linked to the drug.\n\"The study confirms the highly teratogenic [capable of causing birth defects] nature of valproate,\" Mahmoud Zureik, ANSM's scientific director and co-author of the report, told AFP news agency.\n\"The figure of about 3,000 severe malformations is very high.\"\nTypes of birth defects attributed to the drug include spina bifida - which occurs when a section of the spinal column does not form properly - and defects of the heart and genital organs.\nThe risk of autism and developmental problems was also found to be higher, and will be explored in a follow-up report due later this year.\nWomen treated for bipolar disorder were at a lower risk than those treated for epilepsy, the study found, but were still twice as likely to give birth to children with major birth defects.\nAccording to ANSM, this is because women treated for bipolar disorder were less exposed to the drug.\nIn its alert issued on 6 April, the NHS noted that valproate was an \"effective medication used to treat epilepsy  and bipolar disorder\" but added that it was also aware of its \"off-label\" use to treat migraine or chronic pain.\nSome families of children with birth defects born to women who took the drug while pregnant - grouped under an umbrella association known as APESAC (in French) - have sued Sanofi, saying that it did not adequately warn about the risks.\n\"The number of victims is potentially huge,\" APESAC president Marine Martin told AFP.\n\"We need to take into account children with malformations and autism, as well as families that lost a baby due to treatment during pregnancy.\"\nMs Martin says two of her children, a girl and a boy, suffered physical defects brought on by valproate.\nFrench MP Gerard Bapt welcomed the report.\n\"It now appears fundamental that valproate in all its forms should not be prescribed for women of child-bearing age,\" he said.\nMedically necessary exceptions, he added, should be rare and accompanied by \"mandatory contraceptive use\".", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nHe played a leading role in the winning bid and carried the Olympic flame by speedboat to Friday's opening ceremony.\n\"The excitement building throughout the city is incredible,\" said Beckham, 37.\n\"To have an Olympic Games in London is amazing but to have it in an area where I grew up, I'm very proud to have been part of that for the last eight years.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBeckham, England's most-capped outfield player with 115 appearances, added: \"I think we are all ready now.\"\nHis hopes of competing at the Games were ended when Stuart Pearce did not select him for Great Britain's football team, although he insists the pain of his omission will not stop him enjoying the Olympics.\n\"I made it very clear that I'm very disappointed and people around me like my family and friends know how hard it was not being involved,\" he explained.\n\"But I've always been a fan of the Olympics and I always said before it was announced that if I wasn't in the team that I would be here as a fan, I would be here to watch the rest of the athletes perform and that's where I'll be.\"\nGB drew their opening game of the Olympics 1-1 with Senegal and will face UAE in their next game on Sunday.\n\"I haven't spoken to anyone [after the game on Thursday],\" Beckham said.\n\"It's just one of those things where they have got a big game on Sunday and I'm sure the players will be ready but there are quite a few things happening before that.\"\nFormer England captain Beckham will return to play for his club side LA Galaxy during the Olympics but will be back in England before London 2012 is over.\nHe added: \"Our season continues throughout the Games and the summer.\n\"I go back next week and then come back just before the closing ceremony. Hopefully, I am going to be able to get to as many events as possible.\"", "You can see highlights of Sunderland v Arsenal on Match of the Day at 22:20 BST on Saturday on BBC One and the BBC Sport website.\nStoke and West Ham, for example, have started to climb away from the relegation zone but the biggest worry for Sunderland fans is that their side do not look remotely capable of doing the same.\nI know the Black Cats have got out of trouble before having found themselves in a similar situation but this time, after picking up only two points from their first nine games, things look really desperate for the only top-flight team without a win.\nAt least one element of their struggles seems to be self-inflicted, with everyone at the club feeling sorry for themselves - and not just because they have lost some players to injury and conceded some costly late goals.\nThere is a negative feeling about the place with the manager David Moyes and his players talking about how they have gone backwards since last season, when they should be searching for any kind of spark that could change things around.\nFrom the outside, looking at the way they play and their lack of creativity, it is hard to see what that spark might be or what could fundamentally change under Moyes until the January transfer window opens.\nIf they can get one win under their belt then they will get a bit of belief back but, the longer this winless run goes on, the more negativity there will be.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nSunderland finished last season on a high under Sam Allardyce, with a run of just one defeat in their last 11 games securing their safety.\nIn the space of five months, all of that confidence and momentum seems to have been sucked out of the club, despite them effectively having the same group of players who, not so long ago, looked inspired.\nThat is not all down to Moyes, but he has to take some responsibility for it.\nI am yet to see a defined style of play from Sunderland since he took charge at the end of July.\nThat is in contrast to Allardyce's time as manager, when they were resolute and difficult to beat and, at the end of his stint at the Stadium of Light, also played with a purpose when they went forward.\nOff the pitch, Moyes has not helped himself much either.\nThere was no need for him to be so pessimistic when he came out after the second game of the season and announced they would be in a relegation fight, which did not send out the right message to his players or the fans.\nWhen he took charge, he had actually started out by being unrealistically positive - talking about Sunderland becoming a club that regularly finished in the top half of the Premier League - but his expectations went downhill very quickly.\nI know you can argue that he has been proved right, because Sunderland are now battling the drop, but it meant there was a cloud over from them almost as soon as the season had started.\nIt seems to be a case that if you stop Jermain Defoe, you stop Sunderland. His statistics stand up well in comparison to last season, but the rest of their team are not doing enough in attack.\nThey were reliant on Defoe last season too, but others did chip in - in their first nine league games of 2015-16, five players found the net. This time around, only Defoe and Patrick van Aanholt have scored in the same period.\nIt is going to be a massive struggle for them to stay up from the position they are now in anyway, but they badly need a win and quickly. I don't see it coming at home to Arsenal on Saturday, though.\nDo they even look capable of holding out for a draw against the Gunners, the way another struggling team Middlesbrough did at Emirates Stadium last weekend? No.\nIf you struggle to make chances and score goals, as Sunderland do, that puts more pressure on your defence because you know if you concede then you are in big trouble.\nAnd the Black Cats have problems at the back as well - their only clean sheet in 12 matches under Moyes was against League One side Shrewsbury Town in the EFL Cup.\nIt does not bode well against an Arsenal side that are averaging more than two goals a game this season.\nIt is hard to find any positives from Sunderland's situation but at least they have not been cut adrift at the bottom - yet.\nUnless they win soon, that could happen. I think Hull are also in for a very tough season but when I look at the other two teams immediately above them, Boro and Swansea, they definitely have more about them than the Black Cats do.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nChanging manager has clearly not helped Sunderland and comparisons with his predecessor do not help Moyes much either.\nYou cannot tell me that, if Allardyce was still in charge, Sunderland would have only picked up two points so far. It just would not have happened.\nMoyes replaced him relatively late in the summer, which is difficult in itself, but he can only complain about the things that have gone against him up to a point.

I heard the woman's scream and saw her on the floor, but by the time I'd dialled 999 the two robbers had sped off.\nThe incident, in East Finchley, a relatively low-crime area towards the southern end of the London borough of Barnet, provided further evidence of the spread of the \"moped\" crime wave.\nPursuit rules 'create moped highwaymen'\n(The Metropolitan Police refer to the \"step-through-frame\" motorcycles commonly used as scooters - mopeds are strictly speaking a subset of scooters, with an engine capacity of less than 50cc).\nThere are two parts to the crime wave - the theft of the scooters themselves and the offences for which they are used.\nThe Met says that between July 2016 and June 2017 there were 14,943 thefts of \"powered two-wheel vehicles\", the vast majority of which were scooters.\nThe total represents more than 50% of all vehicles stolen in London and is up almost 30% on the previous year.\nThe calendar year figures show the number of thefts has almost doubled since 2013, though the proportion recovered has increased as well.\nIt also appears to be a problem largely confined to the capital.\nPolice in Merseyside and Greater Manchester have set up special teams to combat the illegal use of off-road, or scrambler, bikes, particularly in relation to anti-social behaviour, but none of the  major forces we spoke to across Britain flagged scooter theft as a concern on the scale seen in London.\nAccording to the Motorcycle Industry Association, about 60% of all recorded bike thefts in the UK were in London last year, yet just under 10% of all motorcycles and mopeds licensed in the UK were registered to those living in the city.\nThe rise in thefts has been sparked in part by an upsurge in the stock of scooters available to be stolen.  As the capital becomes more congested and car insurance more costly, scooters have grown in popularity, and as people order more items online, there are more delivery drivers and couriers using them too.\nUnlike cars, which have immobilisers, alarms and sophisticated key devices fitted as standard, the main line of defence for a scooter is usually the steering lock, which can be disabled fairly easily. Police recommend other security measures including trackers, marking devices, covers and chain locks - but thieves have been known to cut through those using angle grinders.\nDiscussions with the motorcycle industry about more effective security are continuing but it's likely to be two or three years before anti-theft systems are embedded into the design of all scooters.\n\"Industry can provide the means to secure bikes, but it can't fix the problems that lead to lawlessness,\" says Steve Kenward, chief executive of the Motorcycle Industry Association.\n\"That is a matter for police, law-makers and the services which tackle disaffection,\" he adds.\nYou might also like:\nCalling your husband by name for the first time\nMan poisoned after eating cherry seeds\nWhy does the US military buy so much Viagra?\nSimon Harding, senior lecturer in criminology at Middlesex University, says the other \"modus operandi\" for thieves is \"use of force\" - getting riders off their scooters by threatening them.  No anti-theft device can prevent that.\nDr Harding says although some stolen scooters are stripped for parts or shipped abroad (the average value of each machine stolen is estimated to be \u00c2\u00a33,000) the main attraction for the gangs is the ability to use them to carry out drug deals and commit other crimes - sometimes as many as 10 in the space of an hour.\nThe number of such offences recorded by police in London has more than trebled in a year.\nIn the 12 months to the end of June, the Metropolitan Police logged 16,158 crimes involving powered-two-wheel vehicles compared with 5,145 the year before.\nMost of the offences were robbery and theft, with mobile phones making up 90% of items stolen. Phones can be reset within minutes and sold on, or used by gang members who like to have a handful of devices each.\n\"It's almost the perfect crime because they're committing it with gloves, helmets and visors,\" says Harding. \"It's very difficult to see them, it's all over in seconds...and they're keenly aware that police may not chase them.\"\nMetropolitan Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Graham McNulty, vehicle crime lead for the National Police Chiefs Council, denies that it is the \"perfect crime\", pointing out that it is conducted in public, which means there are often witnesses. But he acknowledges that officers will end a pursuit if it gets \"too dangerous\".\n\"We do a lot of risk assessment about whether to pursue someone,\" says Mr McNulty. \"Driving in London at speed, with lots of pedestrians, in built-up areas is a high-risk strategy.\"\nAn officer embarking on a car chase with criminals on a scooter has to seek authorisation from their control room. A tactical adviser will be on hand and the operation will be overseen by a chief inspector.  They will weigh up the risks of the pursuit against the seriousness of the offence of which the rider is suspected.\nPolice will consider if the suspect might be a danger to the public and if they are on their way to carry out more crimes, as well as conditions on the road - the weather, the time of day and whether there is a lot of other traffic.\nThe risks were brought home last year during the inquest into the death of 18-year-old Henry Hicks, who lost control of his moped and crashed after being pursued by two unmarked police cars in north London in December 2014.\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission, which investigated the case, said police had \"conducted a pursuit without authorisation from a senior officer in the control room\" and had failed to \"consider the risks to Henry of the pursuit or make any consideration as to whether he may have been a juvenile\".  Four officers are to face gross misconduct proceedings.\nAfter the case, Scotland Yard issued a reminder to officers about the potential hazards of such pursuits and said it had developed new tactics - including the use of tyre-deflation devices.  But there's believed to be a sense among scooter thieves that police have become more cautious about following them at speed.\n\"People are very well aware of the police tactics, therefore they're picking out vehicles... on the assumption that they're unlikely to be caught,\" says Daniel Silverstone, director of the Liverpool Centre for Advanced Policing Studies, who's carrying out research on scooter criminals.\n\"They're deliberately taking their helmets off, so they can't be pursued,\" he says, claiming police will call off a chase if they know a suspect is more at risk of a head injury.\nMr McNulty says although suspects removing their helmets is one of the \"elements\" they have to think about during a pursuit, he says it also gives police a \"real advantage\" because their face can be seen by victims, bystanders and on CCTV.\nIndeed, much of the detective work involves identifying criminals in the hours and days after a pursuit by scouring phone and video footage, tracing the routes they take and looking for fingerprints and DNA evidence.\nThis week, two men were jailed for robbery after the owner of a Vespa was stabbed with a kitchen knife - John Tusting received a 10-year sentence and Lucian Riviere was jailed for eight years.\nAnd last October, a thief who snatched 21 phones in an hour as he drove through five London boroughs was given a three-year sentence.\nBut in spite of the successes of the Met's anti-scooter crime campaign, Operation Venice, it appears to be an increasingly fashionable way for young criminals in particular to boost their street cred. They post online images of themselves on stolen bikes and circulate stories about what they have done.\n\"A great deal of it is about how young people are trying to rise above the pack,\" says Dr Harding. \"It's being used to build up street capital, to build up their reputation.\"\nDr Harding says it is a crime that \"suits the moment\", with so many potential victims walking around with expensive phones, tablets and headphones, and it offers excitement - from the first stage, stealing the scooter, to the last, escaping from police.\n\"There is an absolute thrill factor - young people love the theft, the chase, the crime, the buzz - with the chase from police at the end,\" he says.\nThe two thieves who stole the pregnant woman's phone in East Finchley were chased by a man on a motorbike who happened to be in the area - but he lost sight of them. Thankfully, the victim's baby was unharmed, although she was left bruised and severely shaken.\nThere is a fear, however, that the violence is escalating, with a spate of scooter attacks involving corrosive substances in the past few weeks.\nThere is also concern that it could spread beyond London, which for reasons that are not entirely clear, has so far borne the brunt of this spate of attacks.\nFor the moment, there is no end in sight to this most mobile of crimes.", "Scientists believe they see evidence of surface material having flowed around mountains and even ponding in craters.\nThe activity is certainly recent, they say, and may even be current.\nBut the mission team cautions that it has received only 4-5% of the data gathered during 14 July's historic flyby of the dwarf planet, and any interpretations must carry caveats.\n\"Pluto has a very complicated story to tell; Pluto has a very interesting history, and there is a lot of work we need to do to understand this very complicated place,\" said Alan Stern, the New Horizons principal investigator.\nIn a briefing at the US space agency's HQ in Washington DC, he and colleagues then outlined a number of new analyses based on the limited data-set in their possession.\nThese included the observation that Pluto has a much more rarified atmosphere than previously predicted by the models.\nThis statement comes from measurements made by the probe as it was looking back at Pluto following the flyby.\nIt could tell from the passage of sunlight and radiowaves through the Plutonian \"air\" that the pressure was only about 10 microbars at the surface (1 microbar is about a millionth of the air pressure on Earth at sea level).\nThe other key detection was of hazes in the atmosphere. These are likely the consequence of high-up methane being broken apart and processed by sunlight into simple hydrocarbons like ethylene and acetylene, which then fall, cool and condense to form a mist of ice particles.\nSome of this material will probably be further processed into more complex chemistry that rains on to the surface to give certain regions their characteristic reddish hue.\nBut it is the idea of glacial activity having occurred on Pluto that is most likely to capture public attention.\nThis is interpreted to have happened at the edges of what has become known as Sputnik Planum - the great plain in the western half of Pluto's bright, heart-like feature just north of the equator.\nHigh-resolution imagery from New Horizons' Lorri camera records wavy patterns that look just like the flowing ice of glaciers viewed by satellites at Earth.\nAnd if there was still warmth coming from Pluto's interior then this could allow any surface ices to move and follow a slope, explained co-investigator Bill McKinnon from Washington University in St Louis.\n\"Water-ice at Pluto temperatures won't move anywhere; it's immobile and brittle,\" he told reporters. \"But on Pluto, the kind of ices we think make up the planum (nitrogen ice, carbon monoxide and methane ices) - these ices are geologically soft and malleable, even at Pluto conditions, and they will flow in the same way that glaciers flow on Earth.\n\"So, we actually have evidence for recent geological activity.\"\nHis definition of \"recent\" was \"no more than a few tens of millions of years\". \"And what we know about nitrogen ice and what we can estimate about the heat-flow coming from the interior of Pluto - there's no reason why this stuff cannot be going on today.\"\nNew Horizons continues to observe Pluto even though it has moved some 12 million km beyond the dwarf planet.\nThe probe is looking at the world as it makes its slow rotation (one Pluto day lasts 6.4 Earth days).\nIn about a week's time, this observation will cease and the spacecraft will be spun up.\nThis will permit systems that ordinarily are used to help maintain three-axis stability to be turned off.\nTheir power sacrifice can then be diverted to the transmitter to boost its output.\nIn September, engineers will command New Horizons to start sending back all of the outstanding scientific data it gathered during the flyby.\nThis stored information will be brought down in a compressed form first of all, followed by an uncompressed return.\nThe whole process - encompassing all observations of Pluto and its five moons - will not be completed until late 2016.\nHowever, the New Horizons team says it will share the discoveries as they are made during the long downlinking period.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "Shocked by the incident and other similar attacks on Africans in India, independent photographer Mahesh Shantaram began documenting the lives of Africans living in India.\nBeginning with Bangalore, Shantaram travelled to the cities of Jaipur, Delhi and Manipal, choosing to focus on students, as they are a small and vulnerable group.\nShantaram's series of intimate portraits is part of an upcoming exhibition organised by Tasveer.\n\"Each portrait plays a part in unravelling the complex web of experiences of Africans in India that, put together, paint a picture of loneliness, placelessness and a sense of hostility,\" says art expert Caroline Bertram, in an original text on the exhibition.", "The win keeps the Candystripes two points behind leaders Dundalk who won 2-0 away to Shamrock Rovers.\nFormer Plymouth striker Patterson scored his sixth goal of the season in the 14th minute at the Brandywell.\nHe shot into an empty net after the ball broke to him when keeper Dean Delany thwarted Barry McNamee.\nKurtis Byrne should have netted a speedy equaliser but the son of former Celtic player Paul Byrne completely missed his kick in front of goal.\nThat was the one big scare for Kenny Shiels' men on a night when both keepers had a quiet night.\nDerry City have won six and drawn two in the eight games they have played since losing to Finn Harps on the first day of the season.", "Thirteen people died and dozens were injured when a van ploughed into crowds in the city's Las Ramblas area in the afternoon.\nThe Belfast Telegraph speaks to a newlywed couple from west Belfast who were caught up in the horror.\nMartin and Sharon Kane were on honeymoon in the city and described the scene as \"chaos\".\n\"People were screaming and crying.

Illness, altitude training and pregnancy can all influence values.\nThe Sunday Times reports that eight British athletes - including Mo Farah and Jo Pavey - have published their blood test data \"to show they are clean\" with results falling within the normal expected range.\n\"I'm happy to do what it takes to prove I'm a clean athlete,\" said double Olympic champion Farah. \"The decision to release my results is a personal one.\"\nPavey said: \"It's nice to get it [her blood data] out there, as a clean athlete I've got no reason not to.\"\nUK Athletics said it was \"counselling caution\" to athletes because \"full transparency requires release of all of an athlete's testing history rather than incomplete data that has the possibility of being open to misinterpretation.\"\nIt added: \"Athletes that have chosen to allow their results to be published have in many cases asked for guidance before agreeing to do so, in order to be better informed of any risks involved.\"\nUK Anti-Doping said it has a \"robust\" Athlete Biological Passport system in place and is \"confident\" in its procedures.\nOn Friday a former winner of the London Marathon was stripped of her title for doping.\nRussian Liliya Shobukhova, who won in 2010 and was runner-up in 2011, has had her results since 2009 annulled.

Mr Trump formally confirmed it in a statement on Thursday.\n\"For too long, the Environmental Protection Agency has spent taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs,\" Mr Trump was quoted as saying.\nMr Pruitt would \"reverse this trend and restore the EPA's essential mission of keeping our air and our water clean and safe\", he said.\nMr Pruitt has sued the EPA on several occasions, most recently over Mr Obama's Clean Power Plan, which aims to reduce carbon emissions from power plants.\nHe called the move \"an unlawful attempt to expand federal bureaucrats' authority over states' energy economies in order to shutter coal-fired power plants\".\nAnd, writing in the National Review in May, Mr Pruitt said of climate change: \"That debate is far from settled.\n\"Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind.\"\nThere is consensus among the majority of scientists in the field that carbon emissions from human activities are a key driver of rising temperatures and that the impact of climate change will be severe.\nIn the statement confirming his appointment, Mr Pruitt said Americans were \"tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations\".\nHe said he would run the EPA in a way that fostered \"both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses\".\nThe nomination of Scott Pruitt has two important ramifications. The first is a clear signal from the incoming Trump administration that environmental regulations, especially as they apply to the production of energy, are set for fundamental reform.\nThe second implication is that the Trump camp is not willing to accept that many aspects of the science of climate change are now settled.\nIn his official biography, Mr Pruitt revels in his role as a \"leading advocate against the EPA's activist agenda\".\nMr Pruitt has engaged in legal fights with the federal government on a number of issues, including Obamacare, but it is in fighting the EPA and President Obama's climate regulations that he has really shone.\nAs the chief law officer of a major energy-producing state, Mr Pruitt has taken a lead role in the 28-state challenge to the Clean Power Plan.\nHe has also secured an injunction blocking the EPA's \"Waters of the US\" rule, which expands the scope of the Clean Water Act.\nRead more from Matt: Trump nominee to rekindle climate battle?\nMr Trump, in a speech on energy on the campaign trail in May, castigated the Obama administration's environmental initiatives.

It's a guaranteed income until you die,\" he said.\nMr Fairey is concerned that if people try enough financial advice firms, they might find one that is prepared to help them get their funds released without a proper consultation.\n\"Consumer are used to shopping around,\" he said. \"They'll hit multiple advisory firms; they'll learn what they need to say to get the transaction done.

Working single parents are said to face an annual loss of \u00a31,000.\nRobert Joyce, the author of the IFS report, added: \"The potential gains from simplifying the working-age benefit system remain mostly intact: Universal Credit should make the system easier to understand, ease transitions into and out of work, and largely get rid of the most extreme disincentives to work or to earn more created by the current system.\"\nAlthough Chancellor George Osborne abandoned cuts to tax credits in the Autumn, cuts to UC announced last summer will still go ahead.\nFrom this April the amount that anyone on UC can earn before their benefits are cut will be reduced.\nThis so-called Work Allowance will be \u00a34,764 for those not claiming for housing costs, or \u00a32,304 for those who do.\nOnce claimants earn above that amount, they lose 65p for every pound they are paid.\nFrom April 2017, parents making new UC claims will only be able to take their first two children into account, while the first child premium will be abolished.\nSeparately, a committee of MPs has also complained that UC is getting further and further behind schedule.\nThe Public Accounts Committee report accused the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) of being \"evasive\" when asked about the delays.\nBut the DWP said that the programme was being rolled out \"safely and securely\" and would be completed by March 2021.\nThe overhaul of the welfare system has been driven by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who argued that too many people were trapped on benefits.\nBut shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith said Mr Duncan Smith's claims were \"in tatters\".\nHe said \"everyone can now see that successive cuts to Universal Credit have destroyed many of the work incentives that were supposed to be the very reason for the scheme, hitting single parents particularly hard\".\nThe government has always said that no individuals will lose money as a result of the changes. New claimants for UC will also be helped by transitional support.\nAnd a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"Universal Credit will make work pay and increase financial incentives for people to work more, while also bringing the welfare bill under control.\"\nHe added: \"Universal Credit also includes a wide range of additional benefits -

He writes that he is hoping for \"a beautiful piggy Christmas\" ahead of a trip to Persia in the new year.\nThe Doctor on Dylan Thomas\n\"The whole of the time that Dylan lives in Laugharne there has never been a breath of scandal involving Dylan with other women! With admiration of local females, married and unmarried, there surely existed opportunity for unfaithfulness but Dylan can be absolved absolutely from this.\n\"His capacity for drink was very limited compared with the average 'hearty'. He couldn't drink very much - three or four pints was his absolute limit - his daily limit was two pints in Brown's and on weekends with Phil in the Cross House. He never drank spirits, but in that last trip to America - described in that tragic book by John Brinnin - he undoubtedly posed as a hard drinking genius who could absorb whiskey and this cost him his life.\"\nOn Caitlin Thomas\n\"(Caitlin) is a nymphomaniac and a first-class bitch! What Dylan had to endure through her physical attraction and sexual prowess nobody knows - and I will not countenance any criticism of Dylan's shortcomings and beery excesses when they occurred without taking into account what he must have endured from Caitlin.\n\"On Xmas Eve after his death when his mother came to stay at the boat house for Xmas, she came home tight from the Browns with one of her local boyfriends - put on the gramophone and did a striptease in front of the children and Dylan's mother.\n\"I wonder did Dylan towards the end find life so heartbreaking that he deliberately went on drinking American whisky so as not to return??\"\nOn Thomas' mother\n\"When his coffin came home from America and rested in his mother's house, no mother was prouder. I was glad that she lived to see him honoured by that magnificent performance of Under Milk Wood in Laugharne... But when the curtain dropped on that last performance on the Saturday night Dylan's mother died - just at that moment... She died rejoicing.\"\nCaerphilly-born Dr Hughes - who died in London in 1981 - was based in St Clears and had met the Thomas family in 1938. He was Dylan's doctor until his death in 1953. He was also a keen oil painter and friends with Richard Burton.\nHe wrote the 26-page memoir at the request of the son of a family friend in the 1960s - a student at Cambridge.\nIt resurfaced after former Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, whose love of Thomas' work started in school in Swansea, was told about it at a college reunion last year.\nProf Goodby said the memoir portrayed Thomas as \"the victim\" in his relationship with his wife.\n\"It says more negative things about Caitlin, who he sees as a disruptive force. He calls her 'fast' at one point - rather an old-fashioned word - but the mildest of the words he used about her.\n\"He sees her as one of Dylan's main problems and he surmises that this might be what pushed Dylan to indulge excessively when he went to America; that there was a kind of death wish there because of the collapse of his marriage to Caitlin.\n\"But elsewhere in the memoir what we get is the picture of a happy family man. A contented writer, somebody who was getting on with the business of writing the great poems that he produced at the end of his life.\"\nDr Hughes' memoir also details the death of Thomas' mother, Florence, in 1958 following a performance of her son's play Under Milk Wood.\nIt states she \"died rejoicing\" after the performance in Laugharne, which took place five years after her son's death in New York.\nProf Goodby said Thomas turned increasingly to alcohol during his visits to the USA, and the persistence of his notorious reputation was fuelled by the public's appetite.\n\"People don't want poets to be boring, it's as simple as that. They like their poets to be excessive and inspired by some kind of divine force.

He had to face the fallout from his government's suppression of news of an outbreak of bird flu, as well as criticism over the violent deaths of more than 2,500 people during a crackdown on drugs in 2003.\nThailand's Corruption Commission found he had failed to declare all of his wealth, and he was also criticised over the government's handling of the upsurge in violence in the largely Muslim south.\nYet each time he faced pressure, Mr Thaksin appeared to ride out the storm, his backing among his key supporters - Thailand's rural voters - apparently unscathed.\nIt was his family's decision to sell its shares in one of Thailand's biggest telecom groups, Shin Corp, that led to Mr Thaksin's downfall.\nThe sale, in early 2006, which netted his family and friends $1.9bn, angered many urban Thais, who complained that the Thaksin family had avoided paying tax and passed control of an important national asset to Singaporean investors.\nAmid large-scale street demonstrations, Mr Thaksin called a snap general election for April 2006, effectively telling opponents to \"put up or shut up\".\nBut main opposition parties boycotted the polls and many voters chose to register a \"no vote\".\nFaced with the threat of further protests, Mr Thaksin said he would step down. He did for a few weeks, but returned to office in May.\nIn September that year, following months of political uncertainty, the military seized power while the prime minister was out of the country.\nMr Thaksin relocated to the UK, but shortly after his allies won the first post-coup elections in late 2007, he returned to Thailand.\nThere he and his family faced a raft of corruption charges - allegations which the former Thai leader probably expected to come to nothing.\nBut the courts - greatly empowered by a new military-backed constitution - pursued the cases against him and his family with new vigour.\nFirst his wife, Pojaman, and then Mr Thaksin himself were sentenced to jail terms - with the Supreme Court finding the former leader guilty of corruption.\nHis assets were frozen, forcing him to sell his controlling stake in English Premier League football club Manchester City shortly afterwards.\nMr Thaksin left Thailand, failing to return home for a court appearance from the Olympic Games in Beijing in August 2008, and became a fugitive.\nSince divorcing his wife - who now lives in Bangkok after her sentence was suspended - he has spent most of his time in Dubai.\nHe remains very much at the heart of Thailand's political dramas.\nMr Thaksin's allies lost power at the end of 2008 after a series of opposition protests and court rulings, but they are still a force to be reckoned with.\nThe \"red shirt\" protesters - fiercely loyal to Mr Thaksin - regularly stage rallies demanding political change, and their hero often makes an appearance on a giant video screen to give them encouragement.\nIn May last year a bloody confrontation with the military ended prolonged protests, in which more than 90 people died.\nMr Thaksin may be in exile but he is still a dominant and divisive presence in Thai politics, and a factor in the forthcoming general election.", "The victims managed to call 999 after getting to a petrol station in Tudor Street, Riverside, following the assault in Despenser Gardens.\nBoth men were taken to hospital following the incident which happened at about 19:00 BST on Friday.\nSouth Wales Police said the men were in a stable condition, and appealed for information.", "So far there's been punctured talk of pacts, \"blonde\" bombshell bickering and a promotional \"printing error\", but little in the way of significant substance.\nMaybe it's due to election fatigue on the part of both the prospective politicians and the public after a volley of votes in the past few years.\nThis year, of course, was scheduled to be election-free, but nothing generally goes to plan in the political business.\nAnd there's still the chance of another Northern Ireland Assembly poll in the second half of 2017, should Stormont's summer talks stutter.\nBack in March, a lunchtime trip to Belfast's Electoral Office on the final day of voter registration revealed a line of eager electors snaked all the way down the stairwell and out on to the street.\nThere was no queue when we visited on Monday - the final day for anyone hoping to register for the general election - but there was certainly a steady stream of people dropping off their forms.\nAlong with those updating their records with new addresses, for example, there were more than a few people putting their name down for the first time.\nAmong them was William Thompson.

The order is based on how the teams finished last year.

The Super Bowl winners - New England Patriots - would have been the 32nd pick out of the 32 teams, but they traded their spot to the New Orleans Saints.\nThere are no transfer fees in NFL but teams can trade picks - so do not be surprised to find orders can change. Each team has 10 minutes \"on the clock\" to make their pick in the first round.\nOnce the choice is made, the player is usually paraded on stage and introduced by the league's commissioner Roger Goodell.\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars, who will be playing one game each year at Wembley until at least 2020, is to announce two of its picks from a London studio. The fifth and seventh picks are to be announced by fan Charlotte Johnson, from Lincoln.\nTo be suitable for the draft, players must have spent enough time in US college education to be deemed eligible by the NFL.

much-discussed in connection with Brexit - would be \"inconsistent with the sovereignty argument\" of the Brexit camp.\nNorway enjoys the benefits of the EU single market, but pays a high price for it -

Carl Tremarco took a throw-in near the corner flag, Gary Warren nodded on and Boden found space in the six yard box to head the ball home.\nBefore that Lewis Toshney was very unlucky for United, a late run to the back post was rewarded as he connected with Nick van der Velden's delivery but the ball clipped the crossbar and away.\nUnited's response came immediately after half time, with Murray surging away on the right to find Blair Spittal, who laid the ball off to Murdoch and the midfielder curled a magnificent first time shot home.\nSpittal tried for a quick-fire second but dragged a shot narrowly wide as United started the second period brilliantly.\nMurray was then presented with a gift from Draper's loose pass on the edge of his penalty box. The striker dashed forward and clipped a shot beyond advancing keeper Cameron McKay but his effort slipped inches wide.\nBoden went close to adding a second for the hosts before a Tansey free-kick was pushed away by Cammy Bell, who then saved Liam Polworth's low drive.\nNeither side could find the winner with United slotting home all four of their spot-kicks to earn an extra point.\nMatch ends, Inverness CT 1(1), Dundee United 1(4).\nPenalty Shootout ends, Inverness CT 1(1), Dundee United 1(4).\nGoal!

A few countries maintain ties with Taipei instead of Beijing, and Panama is the latest to switch sides.\nIn December last year, the African island nation of Sao Tome and Principe made a similar move. Now only 20 countries have diplomatic relations with Taiwan.\nIn recent years China has intensified its economic investment into the Central American country - home of the economically vital Panama Canal.\nTaiwan's foreign ministry said in a statement that it expressed \"anger and regret\" over what it called a \"very unfriendly\" diplomatic turn by Panama that \"yielded to economic interests by the Beijing authorities\".\nIt accused Panama of \"bullying\" Taiwan while \"ignoring the many years of friendship\" between the two countries, and added it would \"not compete with the Beijing authorities for money diplomacy\".\nIt was as recently as June last year that Taiwan's leader Tsai Ing-wen visited Panama, on her first overseas trip as president.\nFollowing Panama's announcement, China's state media published photos of the two countries' foreign ministers in Beijing signing a document establishing diplomatic relations and toasting with champagne.\nPanamanian President Juan Carlos Varela said in a televised address that he was \"convinced that this is the correct path for our country\".\nChina's foreign ministry also released a statement (in Chinese) saying that \"the Chinese government and its people highly appreciate and warmly welcome\" the move by Panama.\nThe United Nations in 1971 switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing's People's Republic of China (PRC) and most countries have since followed that lead in order not to antagonise the resurging economic giant.\nMany of Taipei's remaining backers are small island states or in Central and South America - regions that in the past had limited economic ties with China.\nThis is perhaps the biggest blow Taiwan has suffered since relations with Beijing began deteriorating last year.\nBeijing's luring away of Panama is due to political rather than economic reasons. China could have continued investing in Panama without official ties.\nBeijing has lost patience with Tsai Ing-wen, suspecting her of trying to wean Taiwan away from the mainland, economically and politically, with the aim of independence.\nSo China has raised the pressure, cutting off dialogue with Ms Tsai's administration and reducing the number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan. It's also keeping Taiwan out of international and regional groups.\nBeijing's moves may strengthen anti-unification sentiment in Taiwan, but it sees not losing Taiwan as a crucial part of its national identity and seems willing to take this risk.\nIf the current stalemate continues, Taiwan risks further economic and political isolation.\nGiven China's rapid growth as an economic and political superpower, it has been increasingly easy for Beijing to sway countries to its side.\nIn the case of Sao Tome and Principe, Taiwan's foreign ministry condemned the move, alleging the island nation had demanded a huge amount of financial support.\nPanama did not give any reason for changing its diplomatic allegiance but there has been growing economic co-operation with China in recent years.\nChinese companies are developing ports in Panama, and Chinese state firms are said to have expressed interest in developing the land around the Panama Canal once the country opens a tender for it later this year.\nThe Panama Canal is a vital shipping route.

More than 90% of Loliondo's Maasai depend on rearing livestock on seasonal grasses there.\n\"Without land we cannot live,\" said Naishirita Tenemeri, a mother of three.\nMs Tenemeri raises cows and goats in Loliondo to pay for food and her children's schooling.\nThe Maasai have a history of losing their land in Tanzania since the British moved them from the Serengeti in 1959.\nThe former coloniser guaranteed future land rights, but post-independence governments further restricted grazing rights and the latest proposal would remove almost 40% of Loliondo's highland prairie and forested mountains.\nEarlier this month, Ms Tenemeri, wrapped in a traditional red-checked blanket known as a shuka, joined 1,000 people, mostly women, under thorny acacia trees at Olorien village to protest at the plans.\nSome walked for days for the chance to show their anger by publicly giving up their membership cards for Tanzania's ruling party, Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM).\n\"If I have no land then I have no place to deliver my children,\" said Morkelekei Gume, as she tossed her CCM card to the ground.\n\"My son is in secondary school because of the grass from here.\n\"If they need my land they can kill me.\"\nThe women have been so outspoken because they bear the worst of the evictions, left jobless to care for children while the men move to cities, where many find work as security guards.\nThey have also led the protests since local politicians, who had said they backed the campaign against the wildlife corridor, later refused to resign from the party as they had promised to do.\nThe women's outcry spurred the deputy secretary general of the CCM to trek all the way to Olorien, a collection of huts eight hours by four-wheel-drive from the region's main city of Arusha.\nCCM officials then denounced the planned corridor, but the ministry of tourism, and by extension Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete, stands firm.\nMr Kikwete, who will stand down at the next election, in 2015, after two terms in office, has tried for almost a decade to give more land to OBC.\nDuring a 2009 drought, he sent national police to help OBC block herders from a vital water source metres away from the company's current hunting ground.\nThe Maasai say more than half of their cattle died as a result.\nIsaac Mollel, the executive directive of OBC's Tanzania branch, says people are only blocked from water resources during the July to December hunting season - which coincides with the dry season.\n\"If there is hunting going on, it is going to be dangerous if someone comes around and grazes,\" he said.\nFor John Moina, who exports cattle from Loliondo to Kenya, Mr Kikwete's message was clear.\n\"The government is saying OBC is better than citizens of Tanzania,\" he said.\nBut Mr Kikwete's government can earn more income in Loliondo from tourism through OBC - which has catered for English royalty like Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, and the UAE royal family - than livestock.\nAnd Loliondo is ideal for developing tourism.\nIt is rich in game with few visitors, and borders the Serengeti, Kenya's Maasai Mara National Park, and the Ngorongoro Conservation Area.\nTourism Minister Khamis Kagasheki defends the evictions, saying the project will promote conservation as the Maasai are exhausting the land.\n\"These 1,500 sq km are a crucial breeding area for wildlife, a corridor for the iconic great migration of wildebeest, and a critical water catchment area,\" he said in a press release.\nHowever, academics say the Maasai barely affect wildlife.\n\"I would question those who say that the Maasai create more of a threat to wildlife than the hunting OBC is doing,\" said Benjamin Gardner of the University of Washington, who has studied Maasai land issues for two decades.\nThe Maasai rarely hunt, and use the corridor's highlands to avoid wildebeest that give birth in the lowlands and can spread disease to cattle.\nIf Loliondo's 66,000 Maasai plus their livestock are hemmed into only 2,500 sq km, they may overstress land and wildlife.\n\"There is no big drought now,\" said Samwel Nangiria, who heads a group of Maasai non-governmental organisations called NGO Network.\n\"But if they get the corridor it is going to affect twice as many people as 2009.\"\nRegardless, Mr Kagasheki has vigorously defended the government's right to appropriate the land, accusing the Maasai of living in Loliondo illegally and blaming the unrest on foreign-funded groups.\nOBC too points the finger at NGOs and says it has invested in the area over the last 20 years, digging five boreholes, building classrooms and a hospital.\n\"The people communicating for the Maasai are not the Maasai themselves. They make sure that [there is] no clear understanding between the investors and the indigenous people of Loliondo,\" Mr Mollel says.\nIn fact, he says their current five-year concession was supposed to allow them access to the whole of the 4,000 sq km Loliondo area - so the smaller corridor is actually a concession to the Maasai.\nHe also says that, in the government's eyes, the Maasai do not own the land, and it will help protect a drought-prone area.\nThirteen civil society groups from across Tanzania said in a statement that the Maasai do have title deeds for the corridor and the government is \"going out of its ways to deliberately mislead the public\".\nMaasai representatives plan to take the government to court over the corridor, but fear this may not lead to a quick resolution of the problem as a case from 2009 remains unheard.\nMr Nangiria believes there has been deliberate administrative blocking of their legal action as it is a constitutional case which requires three judges, but there is only one judge in Arusha and the other judges have yet to be sent for.\n\"The government should stop interfering with the judiciary,\" the civil society groups said in a statement.\nSo the women under the acacia trees may be running out of options.\n\"Our government is taking us from our land,\" said Paulina Leysa to a group of fellow protesters.\n\"We are crying to anyone who can help.\"\nThe BBC's Erick Nampesya in Dar es Salaam contributed to this report.", "The whale was first seen on Monday off the coast of Kaikoura on the north-east coast of South Island.\nIt was not clear how it came to lose its flukes, said local Department of Conservation ranger Mike Morrissey, but \"it could have been the result of entanglement\" in fishing nets.\nBut despite what looks like a severe injury, the whale seemed to be doing fine, he told the BBC.\n\"It appeared to be in good health and it's bending in the water and using its pectoral fins to spin around,\" Mr Morrissey said.\nWhales are sometimes caught in fishing gear, which can injure or kill them.\nThe tears appear to have happened at least a year ago, Mr Morrissey added, as the images show little sign of open wounds.\n\"This is a young whale and it has healed up.

Sea.\nGovernments, financial institutions, energy, education research, healthcare, aerospace and defence had \"long been a favourite target\" of hackers who look to either destroy or use the stolen material for extortion, it said.\nThere had been a decrease in the number of attacks in the US and western Europe by Chinese hackers, Mr Summers added, because China seemed to be refocusing its efforts to other parts of Asia.\nAsian organisations were ill-equipped to defend their networks from attackers because \"they frequently lack basic response processes and plans, threat intelligence, technology and expertise\", Mr Summers said.\n\"They're not doing enough,\" he said.\n\"But they're starting to wake up to the reality of the threats.\n\"In the US, we were going through this

education.\nThe figures show 12% of free school meals pupils passed the test in 2015, compared with 30% of their better off classmates.\nKent primary schools are \"explicitly asked not to prepare their pupils\" for the 11-plus tests, say the authors, and this favours children whose parents can pay for private schools or tutoring.\nFree school meals pupils fare worst in the verbal and spatial reasoning paper, which is not part of the national curriculum, say the authors.\nThe study identifies a difference between the scores of pupils on free school meals and those of their classmates of:\n\"With only around one in four children getting into grammar school, and with the odds stacked against those from poorer backgrounds, securing access to a grammar school in Kent is like rolling a loaded dice,\" said lead author Rebecca Allen.\nThe authors say the attainment gap is greater in the Kent 11-plus than in the national assessment tests taken by all state school pupils at the end of primary school.\nTheir recommendations include:\nThey also suggest that the entrance system could be simplified by removing head teacher panels that can decide to admit children who have narrowly

might be wrong.\nThis is particularly crucial for children on the borderline where gaining or losing a single mark could determine whether they go to grammar school or not, say the authors.\nPatrick Leeson, Kent County Council's corporate director for education, said the council had begun to implement a series of recommendations in a report last June and there had already been a small increase in the number of children from low-income families gaining grammar places.\n\"But we recognise that there is still more to be done,\" he said.\n\"We are working to improve education for all children in

Much of the inquiry's detailed work is being done out of the public eye, so occasions like this are significant.\nIt was also clear that the inquiry is interested in links between child abuse and power.\nThe Fairbridge Society, in whose care Marcelle was trusted, had royal and establishment supporters.  The evidence shows it was prepared to discredit the birth parents of its children.\nBut the names of the Fairbridge deputy principal that Marcelle O'Brien says indecently assaulted her, and the \"cottage mother\" who treated her so badly were not given, despite calls for the \"guilty to be named\".\nThis is not a court.  The inquiry has no powers of prosecution, only the remit to make \"findings of fact\".\nIt is trying to avoid reaching conclusions about wrongdoing by individuals, unless they are required to show wrongdoing by institutions.\nBut that will not satisfy some of its critics.\nThe inquiry later heard from a 70-year-old British man who was sent to live at an Australian \"farm school\", where he was repeatedly sexually abused and raped.\nGiving evidence anonymously, he said he was targeted by a group of older boys who would drag him into the bathroom or into scrub land and \"make you do what they wanted you to\".\nHe was also sexually abused by a priest and told the panel: \"When he attacked you it was when you got dressed for the choir, he would make sure you were on your own and that's when he would attack you or abuse you.\"\nThe witness lives on his own and says the sexual abuse has made it difficult for him to build relationships with women.\n\"I've had to live with this for 62 years now.

He spent the night hunkered down in his room and was rescued in the early hours of Saturday morning:\n\"At about 19:30 on Friday the fire alarm went off. I went out of the room and saw other guests milling about, and no one seemed to be really concerned. So I went back to my room to get ready to leave for the airport.\nI went downstairs to settle the bill around 20:30 and it was like a scene out of a movie with smoke, gunfire noise, explosions - but all outside of the walls. And a very, very empty and dark lobby.\nI saw someone carrying a gun just outside the hotel and a burning car across the street. and that was my 'oh sh**' moment. I hid near the pool for about five minutes and figured I might just want to plan to spend the night down there.\nSome cooks and kitchen staff walked by, and I made some inquires as best as I could in French. They said I should go back to my room. That was probably the best piece of advice I got that night.\nI turned on the news to see what was happening.\nI ended up spending the night in my bathroom with my computer and - luckily - a good wifi connection. I was able to get in touch with family and friends and crucially also a security consultant from my organisation as well as the US embassy.\nIt was amazing how quickly the night passed and I was thankful to have the internet for the whole time. In fact, it was a great distraction to catch up on emails and pretend it was a normal working day.\nStaying in the bathroom was one piece of advice from the security consultant - to put as many doors between me and the militants. Another was to make as little sound as possible and turn the lights off.\nAs the security forces approached my room at around 04:00 I was pretty certain they were in fact soldiers - and not militants.\nI heard voices that sounded rational and it appeared they were giving instructions in French. They seemed to be making their way methodically through the building. Again, our security consultant was able to advise me that there were French forces in the building and the sounds they were making fitted with the likely pattern of events.\nThey approached my door and I announced myself - as I had been advised. They told me to open the door slowly and there I saw three French troops with rifles pointing at me, along with some US soldiers.\nAs they led me out we passed the lobby. I noticed furniture had been tossed around and there was a clear trail of destruction.\nSuddenly there was another round of gunfire, and we were told to get down for five to 10 minutes. Lying on the floor with incoming fire and protected by soldiers, I felt it was the closest I was ever going to get to experiencing combat.\nJust as the sun was coming up I was led into an armoured personnel carrier and driven down the road to meet US embassy staff.\"\nInterview by Nathan Williams, BBC News", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nThe 21-year-old Belgian World Cup forward, who scored 16 goals on loan at Everton last season, has signed a five-year contract at Goodison Park.\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez said: \"This signing is not just important for this season.

It also halted refugee resettlement for 120 days and banned Syrian refugees indefinitely.\nThe revised order removed Iraq from the list, after it agreed to boost co-operation with the US and also the lifted the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees.\nPreviously, there was confusion about people from the seven countries who were also permanent legal US residents (green card holders), or who already had US visas or dual nationality. The new version makes it clear that visa and green card holders from the countries on the list - now six countries - will still be allowed entry, as will dual nationals travelling on a passport from a country not on the list.\nWaivers can be granted on a case-by-case basis, if denying entry would \"cause undue hardship\", in cases such as:\nThe number of refugees for the year until October will be capped at 50,000, some 35,000 less than the previous 12 months.\nThe second executive order states that each of the six countries is either considered a state sponsor of terrorism by the US or \"has been significantly compromised by terrorist organisations or contains active conflict zones\". This \"diminishes the foreign government's willingness or ability to share or validate important information about individuals seeking to travel to the United States,\" the order says.\nCritics have noted that major attacks such as the 9/11 New York attacks, the Boston marathon bombing and the Orlando nightclub attack were carried out by people from countries not on the list, such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Kyrgyzstan, or by US-born attackers.\nJudges who first suspended - and then upheld the suspension - of the first order cited several concerns:\nThe second order allowed a 10-day lead-in time before it was due to come into effect, in an attempt to avoid the confusion and uncertainty caused by the immediate implementation of the first, where scores of people were detained at airports or in transit.\nBut nevertheless, a judge in Hawaii still suspended the revised order. He concluded that, were the ban to go ahead, there was a strong likelihood it would cause \"irreparable injury\" by violating First Amendment protections against religious discrimination.\nHis justification focused on comments made by Mr Trump and his advisers that suggested their intention was to ban people on the basis of their religion, even though the administration says this is not the case.\nThe Hawaii court also cited a \"dearth of evidence indicating a national security purpose\".\nThe justice department said the ruling was \"flawed both in reasoning and in scope\".\nA judge in Maryland later also blocked the order, on the basis that the travel ban was likely to be considered a ban on Muslims and therefore unconstitutional.\nOther legal challenges to the second order:\nOregon - said the order hurts residents, employers, universities, health care system and economy\nWashington - it has \"same illegal motivations as the original\" and harms residents, although fewer than the first ban\nMinnesota - questioned the legality of the move, suggesting the Trump administration cannot override the initial ban with a fresh executive order\nNew York - \"a Muslim ban by another name\", said the attorney general\nMassachusetts - new ban \"remains a discriminatory and unconstitutional attempt to make good on his campaign promise to implement a Muslim ban\"\nCalifornia - says order is an attack on people based on their religion or national origin\nThis is becoming a crucial question in the legal battle.\nOn 14 February, a US district judge in Virginia ruled the first order was unconstitutional because it had religious bias at its heart.\nRuling on the second version, the Hawaii court also dismissed the government's argument that the ban is not anti-Muslim because it targets all individuals from the six countries, regardless of religion, and the countries themselves represent only a small fraction of the world's Muslim population.\n\"The illogic of the government's contentions is palpable. The notion that one can demonstrate animus toward any group of people only by targeting all of them at once is fundamentally flawed,\" the court ruling said, pointing out that the countries' populations were between 90% and 99% Muslim.\nThe court also cites statements made by Mr Trump, such as a 2015 press release calling for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\".\nBut the Department of Justice says that a distinction should be made between things said as a candidate and as president.\nIn a bid to address religious discrimination issues, the second order removes a particular section that said refugees' claims should be prioritised \"on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individual's country of nationality\".\nMr Trump previously said priority should be given to persecuted Christians.\nThe president said he would take the case \"as far as it needs to go,\" including to the Supreme Court.\nAn appeal against the Hawaii decision would be expected to go next to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals - the same court where a panel of three judges decided in February not to block a ruling by a Seattle court to halt the original travel ban.\nHowever, on 16 March, five of the 29 judges at that court wrote a letter saying they believed that decision was an \"error\", and the first executive order was \"well within the powers of the presidency\".\nIf the Ninth Circuit were to uphold the Hawaii court's ruling, the government could appeal to the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court is currently made up of four conservative and four liberal judges, awaiting the appointment of a replacement for the conservative Antonin Scalia who died last year.", "So when Hillary Clinton came on stage around 10pm on Monday night in Iowa at a rally in Des Moines' Drake University she didn't declare victory but said she was breathing a \"big sigh of relief'\" as she thanked Iowans for their support and their hard work on behalf of her campaign.\nBy the next morning, the final results had come in and Mrs Clinton was officially declared the winner, the first ever woman to win an Iowa caucus and a victory by the narrowest margin in history.

As polls showed Mrs Clinton and her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders in a dead heat, her campaign aides remained cautiously optimistic, predicting a win by a narrow margin. Some who had already gone through the defeat of 2008 were tempering their expectations and contemplated a possible loss.\nMonday night in Iowa was a nail biting evening as the votes were tallied and the margin between Mr Sanders and Mrs Clinton narrowed and then widened repeatedly, often by barely a percentage point. Results projected on a screen in the Clinton rally elicited cheers and gasps from the hundreds of supporters who were waiting for her to appear and speak to them.\nBy the time she left the stage, the race was officially still too close to call. Standing by her side, neither Bill nor Chelsea spoke. And the customary rope line greetings with supporters was scrapped as the Clintons made their way out of Drake University and to the airport to catch a flight to New Hampshire. In the crowd, there was celebration but no jubilation.\n\"This was a tough night. I had hoped she would do better and considering her name recognition and accomplishments and improved ground operation, she should have,\" said Joan Lipkin, a Clinton campaign volunteer who had come all the way from Missouri with 160 volunteers to canvass for the former first lady. Lipkin had volunteered in 2008 and said that her heart was broken then. On Monday night, her heart was ''dented'', she said.\n\"I'm not celebrating because I think Sanders poses a real challenge and many of his supporters are so enraged at the system that they may not come over if she wins the nomination.\"\nLate into the night, on a chartered plane from Iowa to New Hampshire carrying Clinton aides and the press corps covering her campaign, there was exhaustion after days of campaigning in Iowa and trailing behind the candidate on a bus.\nAs headlines swirled about a tie between Mrs Clinton and Mr Sanders, Clinton spokesperson Brian Fallon and communications director Jennifer Palmieri tried to get ahead of the story, briefing journalists before the plane took off so stories could be filed.\n\"We believe strongly that we won tonight,\" Mr Fallon said. Based on their internal calculations and an app that reported turnout levels and delegate allocations, the Clinton camp said they had already determined they had 22 delegates, one more than Sanders, and that the finally tally would allocate the remaining delegate to Mrs Clinton.\n\"So while there are still a few precincts remaining the only candidate who can emerge from tonight's caucuses with a win is Hilary Clinton.\"\nWhen the plane landed at Manchester airport in New Hampshire just before 5am and campaign aides sitting at the front of the plane were able to log into their emails, cheers erupted as they read the news that the final tally had come in from the Iowa Democratic party, in favour of Mrs Clinton. Her two-delegate lead over Mr Sanders is the same as Mr Obama's lead in 2008.\nBut for a candidate with such a formidable resume running against a self-declared socialist from Vermont, the race for the nomination should be a walk in the park.\nIncreasingly since late last year, the expectation is that this will be a long hard slog because Mr Sanders has tapped into a sentiment among young voters and a desire for revolutionary change that Mrs Clinton has not yet been able to channel.\nClinton aides also tried to highlight what could be an ominous sign for Mr Sanders who is counting heavily on caucus states to find a path to the nomination.\n\"Senator Sanders has been saying for weeks that if this caucus was a high turnout affair, he would win. He was wrong,\" said Mr Fallon.  The Clinton aides described Iowa as a left-leaning state that was tailor-made for Mr Sanders' strengths\nTurnout was indeed high at 180,000 and it should have favoured Mr Sanders. This could spell trouble for him in future caucus states like Nevada. Mrs Clinton had once described caucuses as ''creatures of the parties' extreme''.\nIn southern states, Mr Sanders is trailing well behind and failing to connect with African-American voters. Mrs Clinton is banking on these more hospitable grounds to start picking large numbers of delegates to help her advance to the finish line for the nomination.\nRepublican vote, 99% reported:\nDemocratic vote, 99% reported:\nSource: Associated Press, Iowa Republican Party, Iowa Democratic Party\nUS election: Iowa results map\nBut first, Mr Sanders is expected to win by a wide margin in the Granite state. So why is Mrs Clinton even bothering to campaign here?\nPerhaps because in 2008, this was the state that gave her a morale boost after her Iowa defeat. She won by two points after polls had showed her trailing well behind Mr Obama.\nNo one in the Clinton camp expects to win New Hampshire, Mr Sanders' backyard and a state where 44% of voters identify as independent. Although he is running for the Democratic nomination, Mr Sanders is the longest serving independent member of congress.\nIf Mrs Clinton had hoped for a boost in New Hampshire from a sizeable win in Iowa, she will now spend the rest of the week assiduously trying to narrow the gap with her opponent in what is now a two-horse race after former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley dropped out on Monday night.\n\"She loves New Hampshire, she's really excited to be here and it's part of the primary process and she's going to march through each part of it and try to win everywhere,\" said Ms Palmieri.\nPressed about Mr Sanders not yet conceding Iowa, Ms Palmieri replied tersely: \"We won.\"", "During the 19th and early 20th Century, emigrants from Wales settled here, hoping to create a haven for their language, culture and faith.\nToday, the town of Gaiman in the east is where the link with Wales is at its most visible.

The very least they deserve is some openness from government and an explanation for what is going on.\"\nEarlier, Labour's Yvette Cooper said the home affairs select committee, which she chairs, had contacted the lawyers who had left and Lowell Goddard to learn what had gone wrong with the investigation.\n\"What's unclear is how much this has been about legacy problems - and clearly some personality issues - and whether there have also been structural issues over the last two years, or whether there are ongoing problems for the future,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nThe inquiry's third chairman, Lowell Goddard, resigned in August. She has instructed lawyers to fight newspaper claims that she had made racist remarks.\nProfessor Jay has also been under criticism from survivors' groups because of her background in social work - a profession they say has failed them.\nAt Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mrs May said it was important the inquiry continued and that she had \"full confidence\" in Prof Jay and her ability to lead it.\nMeanwhile, the Independent Police Complaints Commission has confirmed it is investigating the conduct of five officers linked to the Met's Operation Midland investigation into paedophile allegations against VIPs - which closed in March without a single arrest or charge.\nThey range from a deputy assistant commissioner to a detective sergeant.\nOne of them will also be investigated over his involvement in Operation Vicente - which looked into allegations made about the late Sir Leon Brittan.\nThis IPCC investigation is separate from the one looking into the handling of the Lord Janner case.\nAn independent review of Operation Midland by Sir Richard Henriques, released last week, found \"numerous errors\".\nOperation Midland was launched after claims that boys had been sexually abused by a group of powerful men from politics, the military and law enforcement agencies at locations across southern England and in London in the 1970s and 1980s.\nIt relied heavily on evidence from a complainant known by the pseudonym \"Nick\", who is now being investigated by the Met for allegedly attempting to pervert the course of justice.", "He took charge of the 2015 Scottish League Cup final between Celtic and Dundee United.\nThis will be his first time refereeing the Scottish Cup final, having been the fourth official when Hibernian beat Rangers in last year's match.\nMadden will be assisted by Frank Connor and Graeme Stewart, with John McKendrick as fourth official.\nSteven McLean and Nick Walsh will be the additional assistant referees.\nCeltic are seeking a domestic treble after retaining the Scottish Premiership title and lifting the League Cup.\nThe Dons have secured the runners-up spot in the league and lost to Celtic in November's League Cup final.", "The pop star was suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver, according to Darren Salter, senior coroner for Oxfordshire.\nThe singer died aged 53 on Christmas Day at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.\nBecause there was a \"natural cause of death\", the coroner said there was no need for an inquest.\nThames Valley Police originally said his death was unexplained but not suspicious and an initial post-mortem examination was \"inconclusive\".\nOn Tuesday, the coroner said in a statement: \"Inquiries into the death of George Michael have been concluded and the final post-mortem report received.\n\"As there is a confirmed natural cause of death, being dilated cardiomyopathy with myocarditis and fatty liver, the investigation is being discontinued and there is no need for an inquest or any further enquiries.\n\"No further updates will be provided and the family requests the media and public respect their privacy.\"\nBy Michelle Roberts, BBC News online health editor\nThe medical terms used on death certificates outline the cause of death, but not all the risk factors that have led up to it.\nGeorge Michael's lists three conditions: dilated cardiomyopathy, myocarditis and fatty liver.\nThis means his heart was enlarged, weakened and inflamed.

Acts of commemoration are taking place this week, but as survivors grow old, how should their stories be remembered? BBC Newsnight hears the stories of four of them.\nI slept through the actual night of Kristallnacht and in the morning as I walked onto the streets there was glass everywhere, and crowds, and I realised something very sensational had happened.\nThere were Nazis standing around in uniform and big smears all over the walls saying \"Die, Jews\" and so forth. And through all of this I walked to the school.\nIt was from Kristallnacht on that the Kindertransport started.\nI don't remember my parents discussing the decision to send me, although they must have. My father was abroad at that time because Jews had been made to leave their businesses, and my father had transferred his truck business from Danzig [now Gdansk] across the border into Poland.\nMy mother had two sisters and her mother living in London at that time, so it was arranged that I would be taken in by my mother's family.\nMy group was the last of three that left Danzig. I was one of 18 children, and we travelled for three days, passing through Berlin, at Friedrichstrasse station, with a Gestapo guy who accompanied us, and a member of the Jewish community who took us all the way to London.\nIn Berlin we had arrived at around four or five in the morning, and an aunt of mine was standing in the station with bananas for all the children because she had heard that we were passing through.\nThe Gestapo guy got off at the railway station at the border between Holland and Germany, and we then went on to the Hook of Holland, and from there by ferry to Harwich and from Harwich to Liverpool Street station in London.\nBy the time we arrived in Liverpool Street we had been sleepless for three days and three nights and we arrived totally disorientated. We were hungry and didn't know the language, and it was a strange world to us.\nThere was a mixture of emotions, a combination of excitement at being in a strange place and of sadness at having parted with one's parents. We weren't aware, and I think maybe many parents weren't quite aware, that this was the last parting ever, because of course the [concentration] camps had not been built.\nThat's what I wanted to show in the sculpture that I did for Liverpool Street station - disorientated, tired, slightly elated, somewhat depressed, bewildered children coming into a wartime England not knowing a word of the language, I wanted to show it the way I remember it was.\nMy mother's two sisters were at Liverpool Street station and off I went. Others were taken in by people who had previously agreed to accept children to their homes. Where there was no place for the children in homes, they were taken to some kind of hostel.\nOne of my aunts was married to a Bavarian doctor who had resettled a year or two before and had a practice in Harley Street. They lived with my grandmother, so there was my mother's sister, her husband, their son and my grandmother.\nWhen my parents said goodbye to me on the platform, my father said: \"Whatever happens, study, go to university,\" which I tried to do and did. That's the advice I got, and for better or worse I carried it out.\nI had to learn English first, for which I got private lessons, and then was accepted into a boarding school in north London.\nIn terms of what was happening back home during the war, I think the British government suppressed a great deal of what they knew concerning the concentration camps. They had their own reasons to underplay this, but the German refugees here knew all about it.\nThe rumours were rife there, and people knew what was happening in Auschwitz and in Buchenwald, that something terrible was happening there, which the British authorities did not want known.\nI remember being taken by the school to a play in the West End, and it was in the middle of the play that I was sitting there with all the other students, when I suddenly said to myself: \"I'm an orphan.\"\nI suddenly realised that the chances of my parents still being alive after what I had heard were minimal. I don't know why it came to me in the theatre, but I remember sitting there in that chair and coming to that understanding.\nI got the confirmation of this from the Red Cross after the war, and also from my father's brother, who had survived and had himself passed through Poland during the war and looked for them.\nWhen I try to piece together what there would be in common between all of us who were on the Kindertransport, it would be that, as I wrote in a book, we entered the train in Danzig as children; we disembarked in Liverpool Street Station as adults, because we were now responsible for our own lives.\nWe experienced too much too soon. I think that probably is the epitaph of our youth.\nThere are a number of things that often play in the back of my mind as I think about the transports, the feeling that parents must have had to make that decision to send their child away; added to that, the promise of \"we'll see you again shortly, hopefully\", which of course in many cases never occurred.\nI was a young child and I cannot remember my reaction to being told I was going abroad. I know my parents made me a promise. They promised me a suit with long trousers, because in those days boys wore shorts only, when I had my bar mitzvah.\nBut of course the promise was unfulfilled as they didn't survive.\nI cannot remember much of how I felt at my time of leaving for England. It's almost like a curtain came down and blacked it all out.\nI didn't know the language except one sentence. Interestingly my parents taught me a sentence in English, which was: \"I'm hungry, may I have a piece of bread?\", or words to that effect, which I've fortunately never had to use.\nAll of the children were allowed only one small piece of luggage. I still don't know to this day why, but I was able to take two cases with me: an ordinary big case and an old-fashioned trunk.\nI had clothes and a hairbrush, which mother packed to make sure that her darling little son kept his hair tidy, and a shoe bag and other bits.\nFather would have probably left most of the packing to mother, but he ensured that I took things that were important from a Jewish point of view. He came from an Orthodox Jewish home and he made sure that I had prayer books. And there was a photo album that was given to me, a little tiny one.\nI don't really remember saying goodbye to my father and sister. My mother came with me to Hamburg and we boarded the liner and I said goodbye to her there.\nWhen I got to England I was sent to Margate, where I lived in a group of 50 youngsters up to the age of about 16 or 17. I was the youngest. I learned English and learned to play games which I'd never heard of, such as hopscotch.\nI was lazy when it came to writing to my parents, and also I had to choose whether I would use my pocket money to buy sweets or stamps, but I did write and I got letters back.\nUnfortunately I destroyed all those letters when war broke out. An older child said: \"You can't keep those, if the Germans come here it's no good,\" so sadly I destroyed all my parents' letters.\nOnce the war broke out there was no further communication. Around about 1942-43 we tried to contact them via the Red Cross, as a number of people did, but we heard nothing, as by that time they were no longer alive.\nMy father died in January 1942 and my mother in the March. I heard about my parents' death in 1945. My sister met me from school and told me and I just went on with my life. There was nothing much more I could do and that was that.\nI'd already sort of lived with the loss in my own mind because I'd not heard from them since the war began.\nI remember it was night when we went to the railway station because, I think, they didn't want the population to know what they were doing.\nIn a way I didn't understand it all. I wasn't stupid or anything, but it was just a thing that you couldn't comprehend. I remember my father telling me that I would like it in England because I would be able to ride the horses, but the reality wasn't like that at all.\nThe journey was such a blur. On the boat we had bunks because we crossed in the night. I remember going to the toilet, and when I was out of the compartment I cried and one of the helpers who was on the journey said: \"Don't do that, you'll set the young ones off.\"\nWhen we arrived in England we stayed overnight in London with the uncle of Eve, the friend I had travelled with. In the morning we took a train to Hinckley in Leicestershire, where we were both due to go.\nI remember my foster parents coming in. He wore a bowler hat, which he took off. He was quite an elderly gentleman and she was a fairly stern-looking lady.\nI don't know whether they were just the type of people who didn't hug or kiss or anything. I can't ever remember being hugged, you know? Of course we couldn't talk together either, which I suppose was a hindrance.\nI went to school for a couple of years, and my foster parents went to work, both of them.\nI was basically a maid, hoovering and polishing and washing up, and I was a young pair of legs for going shopping.\nThen of course we come to the time when I left school at 14. On the very next Monday I was introduced to my first factory job, where I promptly ran the needle of the sewing machine through my thumb. I don't think I lasted very long in that factory.\nBut then there was always another one. And so it went until I was 18, when I decided to leave my foster parents. I took lodgings with one of my workmates.\nUntil I left my foster parents, I was sort of continuously homesick, and it's a horrible feeling. You know, it was always there.\nWe didn't part on terribly good terms, because I think they thought I would live there for ever. I suppose they were fond of me. I just don't know.\nIt was a matter of luck who you went to and I just wasn't that lucky. But then again you've got to think that they saved my life.\nI came to England in April 1939 and I was five and a bit years old. The passport I travelled on was issued by the German Reich, and on the front page there was a J in red to designate that I'm Jewish.\nMy father was a doctor and he had his practice near the showbiz part of Vienna. My mother worked as a dancer in one of the theatres and she went to him as a patient and they fell in love. Since she wasn't Jewish, she converted.\nI don't remember getting on the train, but I do remember the train stopping and people coming in and giving us a sweet drink and then we carried on.\nFirst I stayed with quite a strict family. I recall silly things, like having to wear a straw bonnet and being forced to make my own bed with hospital corners. I don't think I stayed there that long. It probably wasn't more than a year or so, and then I moved to Cambridge.\nI remember at one point a card coming from my parents, and rushing down the stairs and then being quite emotional. I think that must have been the first contact then, since I remember it as an event.\nIn Cambridge I moved to a very nice family. They had a son about the same age as I was, a beautiful house and a big dog, and I started school. I think the family would ideally have adopted me because they had a boy and I was a girl, but then the mother had to go into hospital to have an operation and so I went to another family in Cambridge.\nAfter that I was in a hostel and another family, until eventually I moved to stay with my uncle from Moravia and his family, who had settled in Hartlepool.\nThe refugee committee hadn't wanted me to go to them until they had a stable set-up, but when they became established in West Hartlepool and my uncle got a steady job as a teacher I was allowed to have a holiday with them there to see how I liked it.\nI had a lovely holiday and my aunt said to me: \"You know you're going back now, but when you come back it will be for ever,\" and so it was.\nMy mother was working in a factory during the war and she was killed when it was bombed. I felt sad, but I didn't really know her. I just sort of had flashes of memory of her.\nMy father managed to survive the war and in 1948 he came over, full of hope, to see his only child, but it was quite a traumatic experience because I'd more or less got a new father. Things did thaw during his stay but it was quite hard because for him it was a continuation, but for me it was something new.\nI was all geared up to go to Vienna the following year, but unfortunately in the February of that year he had a massive heart attack and died.", "Thursday was declared a public holiday to allow supporters of the 89-year-old to attend the inauguration.\nThe ceremony had been delayed by a court petition filed by his main rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, over allegations of widespread electoral fraud.\nBut the Constitutional Court dismissed the case, declaring Mr Mugabe's re-election \"free, fair and credible\".\nMr Mugabe won with 61% of the presidential vote against 34% for Mr Tsvangirai on 31 July.\nBy Nomsa MasekoBBC News, Harare\nRobert Mugabe's inauguration was witnessed by thousands of jubilant supporters and invited guests in Zimbabwe's biggest sports stadium on the outskirts of Harare, amid tight security. Many former heads of state and deputy presidents attended the event, but tellingly very few of the continent's current leaders.\nThis is perhaps a tacit acknowledgement of the concerns which have been raised around Zimbabwe's disputed election, in which Mr Mugabe emerged victorious with more than 60% of the ballot.\nThere were loud cheers from the veteran leader's supporters when he read out his oath. In his inaugural speech, Mr Mugabe attacked Western nations for refusing to accept the election results and took a swipe at his main rival, MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai, describing him as a \"sore loser\". He also made time to speak out against homosexuality, saying it was a filthy disease that destroys nations.\nZanu-PF is now firmly in control and the party has vowed to press ahead with its economic empowerment policy, which seeks to take over foreign-owned businesses.

one of the oldest in Nepal and highly revered in Tibet - could be swept away or damaged by floods and mudslides caused by the outburst of a glacial lake on the mountain overlooking their village.\nFor the past five years, Halji has been hit by glacial lake floods almost every summer and the last one, nearly two months ago, damaged two houses and swept away four horses.\nSeveral crop fields were washed away and many remain covered with sands, rendering them barren for many years to come.\nVillagers say the historic monastery now stands only around 15m away from the river bank that has been eroded by flood waters.\nThey fear the next time the Tak Tsho lake bursts like it did this year, it may hit the 1,000 year-old sacred site.\n\"It is our identity,\" said Kojuk Objang Tamang, the head of Halji village. \"We cannot even imagine about our community without the monastery which is the base of our religious culture,\" he told the BBC.\nSo strong is the community's belief in the monastery that they are convinced that it has saved them from the floods and mudslides so far.\n\"It is because of the blessings of the monastery that the village is hit by floods at day time only and so there is no loss of human lives because we can run to safety during daylight,\" said Mr Tamang. \"Had it happened in the night when we were asleep, God knows how many of us would have been dead by now.\nAstrid Hovden of the University of Oslo, who has been conducting her PhD research in Halji, has witnessed how central the monastery is to the community of around 100 households.\n\"At the night of the flood (last June), after the water level in the river started to get back to normal, the monks performed an elaborate ritual in the monastery to pray for the safety of their village.\n\"Since the villagers became aware of the problem, they have invited important lamas (priests) from outside to perform rituals to protect their village.\"\nPrayers apart, the villagers have also done whatever they could to save the monastery and their settlement.\nAlthough almost all of them are uneducated, they have knocked on the doors of the prime minister's office in the capital Kathmandu, the local authority and the national planning commission.\nThose efforts had secured some funding, which they used to build defences using rocks and gabion wires to tame the flood waters.\n\"Every family in our village worked free of cost for the construction of those infrastructures,\" says Tamang.\nBut villagers say that every year, the floods and mudslides hurtling down from the glacial lake - at a height of around 5,300m on the Gurla Mandhata mountain -  become increasingly dangerous.\n\"Our effort to save the village is proving to be no match for the force of the floods,\" said Mangal Lama, a social worker from the region.\nMr Lama and other locals said they hiked up to the area where the Tak Tsho lake is located and found that it is hidden behind a hanging glacier.\n\"We saw huge cracks on the glacier, and that explained why we used to hear big sounds around the same time in June every year before we were hit by floods.\n\"Apparently, it appears that the huge pieces of ice sheet from the cracked parts of the glacier might have fallen into the glacial lake which then overflowed, causing floods and mudslides downstream.\"\nSome scientists say climate change has accelerated glacial meltdown in the Himalayas, creating many new glacial lakes and filling up existing ones to dangerous levels.\nMost of the 4,000 or so glaciers and their lakes in the Nepalese Himalayas are not monitored, like the one above Halji in Humla district.\nNepal's National Adaptation Programme of Action, prepared under the United Nations climate convention, has rated the district's vulnerability to glacial lake outburst flood as \"very low\" - something which has been disputed.\nMr Lama said some villagers are so frustrated that they are considering going to Tibet across the border to become refugees.\n\"It takes five days walk to reach the nearest local authority of Nepal while Taklakot (the nearest Tibetan market) is only 12 hours away and moreover the villagers speak the Tibetan language and follow all traditions of Tibet.\"\nLocals say they cannot move the monastery and their settlement to a safe place.\n\"The moment we move the monastery, its religious and historic value will drop to zero,\" says Tamang. \"And that, in turn, means our century-old intact religious and cultural community will break and it will all be over.\"", "Revenue commissioner Liam Irwin was giving evidence to the Irish parliament's finance committee.\nHe said the authorities would try to minimise customs controls but they are required under EU law.\nIt would mean checks on 6% to 8% of freight, mainly on documents but with a \"small number\" of physical inspections.\nMr Irwin said checks would not happen at the border but at \"trade facilitation posts\" which would be \"10 or 15 kilometres back from the border.\"\nHe also said there would also be some form of random, or risk-based, customs checks carried out by mobile units.\nThe commissioner emphasised that customs declarations would happen electronically, and most transactions would be immediately approved.\nHe said there would not be a return to a pre-1992 situation when there were customs posts at the border.\nSeamus Leheny, from the NI Freight Transport Association, described the plans as \"quite concerning to those involved in moving goods cross-border\".\n\"On average we're looking at a minimum 6,000 HGV movements cross-border on a daily basis so if we're looking at 8% of those vehicles having to be checked, there's potentially 500 to 600 vehicles actually having to stop and have goods looked at,\" he said.\n\"These costs would obviously have to be passed on, because there would be consequences with delays and journey time reliability.\n\"If you have 500 to 600 lorries having to stop every day, those delays could be anything from five minutes, half an hour.\n\"It depends really on paperwork checks or maybe physical inspection of goods and the running costs for a 44-tonne lorry which typically travels cross-border is \u00c2\u00a31 a minute and those costs have to be covered by someone.\"\nSinn F\u00c3\u00a9in's finance spokesperson, Pearse Doherty, said border communities would be especially affected.\n\"Obviously, any restrictions on traffic and consignments entering and leaving the north will have a devastating impact on the economies both north and south,\" he said.\n\"Businesses on both sides will suffer greatly should what was revealed by revenue come to pass and that is simply stating an undeniable fact.\"\nThe UK government has said it intends to leave the EU Customs Union as part of Brexit but is seeking new customs arrangements.\nThe EU, the UK government and the Irish government have all said they do not want a \"hard border\".\nMr Irwin said Irish customs authorities are not currently in \"any form of discussion\" with the UK.\nHe said that the number and value of customs declarations would increase by a factor of 10 as a result of Brexit.\nHis organisation is also looking at how \"small local traders\" can be facilitated.", "Mr Yee, 18, has been detained in the US since he arrived at Chicago's O'Hare airport in December.\nHe came into the country on a tourist visa but told immigration officials he was seeking refuge.\nFollowing Friday's ruling, he is expected to be released shortly.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security opposed Mr Yee's asylum application, but the immigration judge ruled in the teenager's favour.\nJudge Samuel Cole released a 13-page decision, which said Mr Yee faced persecution in Singapore for his political opinions.\n\"Yee has met his burden of showing that he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion and has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Singapore,\" Judge Coel ruled.\n\"Accordingly, this court grants his application for asylum.\"\nAmos Yee is not the only one celebrating his US asylum win -

What is it actually doing to help you in your life?\"\nA Context study found most European home-owners are still reluctant to invest in smart tech - 19% of Britons said that they would buy one smart gadget in the next year and, even then, it would have to cost no more than \u00c2\u00a3150.\nThe BBC has been looking at some of the smart tech on offer for the family home at CES.\nThis may just be the craziest thing to come out of CES but it was taken seriously enough by a panel of expert judges to win the CES Launchit ShowStoppers award.\nDescribed by founder Leo Trottier as a games console for dogs, the Cleverpet gadget consists of three flashing lights and a treat dispenser. The dog has to press the lights in the right combination in order to win the treat.\nIt also has a microphone and speaker so that pet owners can task their dogs with more complex games - such as touching a particular colour or combination of lights.\n\"A dog with a job is a happy dog,\" said Mr Trottier as part of his pitch to the judges. \"And my user-base quite literally has nothing else to do.\"\nHe knows a thing or two about training animals - he told the BBC that he taught his cat to use the toilet.\nMore seriously, there are hundreds of pets left home alone each day and Mr Trottier is keen to find a solution to the suggestion that many of these animals are bored. He believes that some dogs will learn to advance to complex levels.\nThere is some serious science behind the design - one member of the team is a neuroscientist who has spent years teaching grammar to birds - and Mr Trottier himself is a cognitive scientist.\nA little black and white dog named Fiona demoed the system for me, but she could only handle the one button level as she has only been training for a week.\nOk, this falls very much into the same category as the smart water bottle as something that is only tenuously smart, and it costs more than \u00c2\u00a3150 - retailing in the US for $400 - but, come on, it's a cocktail maker for your home.\nBartesian looks a lot like a capsule-based coffee maker and it is basically the alcoholic equivalent.\nThere are reservoirs for the spirits - vodka, rum, tequila and gin - and these must be supplied by the owner.

This prevents Bitcoins from being spent twice.\nNo middleman is required to verify the transaction, which, say supporters of Bitcoins, makes them quick, secure and cheap to use.\nAre crypto-currencies the future of money?\nUnregulated Bitcoin funds exist elsewhere, but the official approval allowed major investors, such as pension and insurance companies, to speculate on Bitcoin for the first time.\nHaving his accounts closed by HSBC is only the latest difficulty faced by GABI, said Mr Masters.\nHe said that when he was launching GABI he could not find any island bank willing to provide services, so took GABI's business elsewhere.\nGlobal Advisors has found another Jersey bank, but GABI's banking is not done on the island, although the fund remains registered and regulated in Jersey.\nGeoff Cook, chief executive of Jersey Finance, said he could not comment on individual cases, but said GABI reflected Jersey's position \"as both a leading hedge fund jurisdiction and a pioneering centre for the rapidly evolving world of fintech (financial technology\".\nThere have been issues around the digital currencies, including a lack of regulation and concerns about the potential for money laundering and other illegal activity.\nIn October 2013 the FBI shut down online marketplace Silk Road, which traded in drugs and other illegal goods and took payments using \"crypto-currencies\".\nA spokesman for HSBC said: \"We do not discuss individual customers, nor do we confirm whether an individual or business is, or has been a customer.\"\nBut he added: \"In reviewing our portfolio, we have identified a number of relationships that don't meet our strategic criteria.\n\"We don't take the commercial decision to end a customer relationship lightly, and when we do so it follows careful consideration of that relationship in light of our strategic focus or global risk management standards.\"", "Roger Christian always intended to make his dark fantasy adventure, which was shown as part of screenings Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back, into a full-length movie.\nBut a lack of funding and little appetite for the genre among cinema audiences always seemed to be against him.\nBlack Angel began life in the late 1970s when Christian's friend and Star Wars' creator George Lucas handed him the opportunity to turn his idea into a 25-minute short.\nLucas's offer was in part a \"thank you\" for Christian's work on original Star Wars - A New Hope, for which Christian won one of his two Academy Awards for his set design.\nPulling together a small production team and with a budget of just \u00c2\u00a325,000, Christian headed to Scotland in the final months of 1979 to shoot the short.\nBlack Angel is an Arthurian tale of a knight who rescues a princess while he is returning home from the Crusades.\nThe short film was made entirely in Scotland on a shoestring budget. The locations included Eilean Donan near Dornie, Bernera Barracks at Glenelg, Loch Eck in Argyll and a swimming pool in Dunoon, where underwater scenes were filmed.\nIt was shown the following year in cinemas in the UK, Scandinavia, Japan and Australia as part of screenings of The Empire Strikes Back.\nLondoner Christian is now preparing to return to Scotland this autumn.\nAnd his old haunts of Eilean Donan, the wider Lochalsh area and also Skye are on his film location wish list.\nMost of the film is being made at a studio in Budapest in Hungary where Christian and his production team have been able to take advantage of incentives to keep costs down.\nBut he said Black Angel cannot work without Scottish landscapes.\n\"I have to film in Scotland, and in late September and early October as I did the first time,\" says Christian.\n\"The quality of the natural light at that time of year in Scotland is like nothing else in the world.\n\"It allowed us to shoot scenes that would have required CGI, technology that was not available to us at that time.\"\n\"I have also found my Obi Wan Kenobi,\" adds filmmaker.\nA wise and powerful wizard-like figure, Obi Wan is one of the best known characters of the Star Wars canon.\nIn the early films, the Jedi knight was played by Sir Alec Guinness and in more recent episodes by Ewan McGregor.\nChristian says: \"From Scottish legend there is a figure called Myrddin, who some people believe to be an inspiration for stories of the wizard Merlin.\n\"In Black Angel, the character is a wandering sorcerer, a half-god/half-man, who lives under the castle of Eilean Donan.\"\nChristian has written of working on Star Wars, Black Angel and other films such as Alien in his newly published memoir, Cinema's Alchemist.\nIn the book he tells of making weapons such as light sabres and blasters for Star Wars and also working on some of its most iconic creations, such as the Millennium Falcon space ship.\nScotland features prominently in a chapter devoted to Black Angel.\nChristian said: \"I went to Scotland to make Black Angel by design, rather than accident. I already knew Scotland at the time and what it had to offer.\"\nInfluencing this choice in locating the short in Scotland were the works of Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, whose most famous films include Seven Samurai.\nChristian says: \"I wanted to make a film in the style of Kurosawa, who used epic landscapes. I knew that I could find similar landscapes in Scotland.\"\nSeveral factors convinced Christian that now was the right time for a feature-length version of his cult short.\nFirst, there was the interest in social media and film fans in the rediscovering of Black Angel in 2012 after years being lost in an archive, and subsequent screenings of it in Scotland in 2014.\nInterestingly, a TV series that could have been made in Scotland but ended up using locations in Northern Ireland instead has helped Christian and his team secure investment - and a potential audience - to his new film.\n\"Game of Thrones has created huge interest in the fantasy genre,\" said Christian.\n\"This is the right time to be making the film.\"", "The A725 underpass which runs below the M74 motorway, has been under construction since July 2015.\nIt is hoped that the route between Bellshill and East Kilbride will help ease congestion at junction 5 near Hamilton in South Lanarkshire.\nEconomy Secretary Keith Brown said it should improve journey times through the junction by up to 15 minutes.\nScottish Roads Partnership (SRP) completed the construction as part of the \u00c2\u00a3500m motorway improvement plan which began in February 2014.\nThe work will upgrade the A8 between Glasgow and Edinburgh in addition to major improvements to the M73, M74 and A725.\nThe 560m long (1,837ft), 35m wide (115ft) underpass will provide a free-flow link for traffic between the Bellshill Bypass and the East Kilbride Expressway.\nMr Brown said: \"This investment will make a tangible difference to road users, alleviating the traffic congestion that has been a historic problem at the Raith.\"\nFormally known as the Bothwellhaugh Interchange, the Raith is used by 75,000 vehicles on a daily basis.\nNow, 50 years since the junction first opened to traffic, SRP have also constructed three new bridges to carry the motorway and local traffic over the new underpass.\nIn addition, two new footbridges are being installed over the roundabout which will create a safe access route over the busy junction between Bothwell and Strathclyde Country Park.", "The 20,000 Sfr (\u00c2\u00a315,694) fine relates to commemorations at the 1-1 draw on 12 November.\nEngland, Scotland and Northern Ireland have also been penalised.\nFifa's Claudio Sulser said he \"fully respected\" the commemorations but rules needed to apply.\nVince Alm said: \"Fans are outraged that the Welsh FA has even been implicated in this.\"\nFootball's governing body took action against the Football Association of Wales (FAW) because fans wore poppies in the stands and the armed forces held bunches of poppies at the side of the pitch.\nMr Sulser, disciplinary committee chairman for Fifa, said: \"The display, among others, of any political or religious symbol is strictly prohibited.\"\nMr Alm said many supporters he had spoken to said the FAW should refuse to pay the fine.\n\"These were just normal fans wearing poppies when it's their personal choice to do so,\" he added.\n\"For the vast majority of supporters, wearing a poppy is not a political statement but a symbol of remembrance.\"\nThe FAW has been asked to respond.", "A public inquiry will open into the possible upgrading of the road between Pembury and Tonbridge, in west Kent, into to dual carriageway.\nBusinesses have said the scheme is needed to reduce a bottleneck and government money could be available from 2015.\nHowever, the Woodland Trust said the scheme would damage the environment.\nOliver Newham, from the trust, said: \"There are over 1,000 species of fungi in here, 10 species of ladybird, 24 species of bee -

in a way that does not always reflect local populations.\nIn London, about 26% of pupils are white British, but 49% of these children are in schools with a white British majority.\nChildren from Bangladeshi, Pakistani and black Caribbean communities are also disproportionately likely to be at school with children from the same ethnic background.\nAbout a third of pupils in primary school are now from ethnic minorities, but this study shows that below this average there are very wide regional differences.\nIn seven local authorities in London, there are no white British pupils in a school with a white British majority. While in 71 authorities across England, there are no ethnic minority pupils in schools where they are in a majority.\nThe study examines where there is greatest segregation, in terms of how dissimilar school intakes are to local populations.\nThe top 10 authorities with the highest levels of segregation are mostly in the North and Midlands: Blackburn with Darwen, Birmingham, Haringey, Bradford, Rochdale, Kirklees, Leicester, Oldham, Rotherham, and Manchester.\nThe study does not examine why or how such segregation takes place, on a local or national level, but it says that research shows that this is not simply a reflection of where people live.\nIt points to research that \"schools were more segregated than the local neighbourhoods that they served\".\nTrevor Phillips, chairman of the Mapping Integration Project at Demos and former head of the Commission for Racial Equality, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, said this was \"not a story of terrible racial hostility\".\nInstead, he said, it reflected demographic shifts and a pattern of the individual, localised choices of parents about where they and their children would feel \"comfortable\".\n\"Most families unconsciously make a choice which tends to line up with their own racial background,\" said Mr Phillips.\nBut he said this tendency towards separation had a negative effect, not preparing children for a diverse society.\nMr Phillips said the success of schools in London showed how much children from all backgrounds could benefit from schools with a high proportion of ethnic minority pupils.\nProf Burgess said that although schools \"in some places remain highly segregated\", the longer-term trend is that such separation is \"generally declining or is stable\".\nBut Dr Norrie said: \"While we couldn't expect these communities to spread out on a truly equal scale, we would hope for a much greater level of integration for students at the start of their education.\"\nThe analysis of ethnicity and education shows that, allowing for socio-economic factors, white British pupils are the lowest achieving group at GCSE level.\nThe study also shows that ethnic minority pupils are more likely to have private tutors, more likely to attend private school and go to a Russell Group university than their white counterparts.\nLast week, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said that there needed to be more good and outstanding schools available to white, working-class communities.\nSir Michael warned that white low-income families can feel \"abandoned\" and \"forgotten\" by the school system.", "Labour's David Winnick told Phil Gormley that Police Scotland's work in places like Sri Lanka was \"hypocrisy\".\nBut Mr Gormley said the force was under \"significant budgetary pressure\" and needed to seek additional income.\nThe Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Scottish government had \"full knowledge\" of the contracts, he added.\nMr Gormley was speaking at a Westminster home affairs committee on Tuesday.\nHe confirmed Police Scotland's international development unit provided training in Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and South Sudan, among others.\nThe force has been training officers in Sri Lanka for several years, despite concerns being raised by Amnesty International about the country's record on torture, arbitrary arrests and deaths in custody.\nMr Winnick asked him: \"Sudan has a notorious record of outright brutality... Isn't there a contradiction of this country [the UK] upholding certain principles, human rights and the rest and an organisation like yours having contracts with governments that are totally in the opposite direction?\"\nThe MP also claimed police in the UAE tortured two Britons arrested on drugs charges.\nHe added: \"If they torture British citizens, one can only imagine what they do to their own citizens.\"\nPolice Scotland has provided training on child protection and crash investigation to officers in the UAE's police force.\nBut Mr Gormley said Police Scotland was trying to improve standards of policing around the globe and told Mr Winnick \"no concerns had been expressed\" about the countries where they worked.\n\"Clearly I'm a public servant - there is a political dimension to this that is not part of my role,\" he said.\n\"There are relationships with some of those governments that you have described. What we are trying to do when we go out and do training is to raise the standards of policing in those environments.\"\nHe also said the income provided by international training work was a vital boost to the force's \u00c2\u00a31.1bn budget which it receives from the Scottish government.\nMr Gormley said: \"We are under significant budgetary pressure and therefore if we can legitimately raise revenue - either in terms of cost recovery from sporting events or through delivery of training domestically or internationally - then we will seek to do it.\"\nThe chief constable denied that the deployment of officers overseas used resources needed in Scotland.\n\"We wouldn't compromise our ability to deliver at home in order to make relatively modest amounts of money abroad,\" he said.\nMr Gormley was sworn in as chief constable in January.\nHis appointment followed Sir Stephen House's decision to step down from the post after coming under pressure over the M9 crash, stop and search, and the role of armed officers.\nA statement from Police Scotland later said forces had \"provided practical capacity-building training for over 20 years to a range of countries\".\nIt said: \"Police Scotland recovers the full cost of this training from the Scottish and UK governments to ensure there is no detriment to the citizens of Scotland.\"\nThe statement also said the training was not a response to financial challenges faced by Police Scotland.\nIt said: \"There are significant benefits to our officers and staff and the people of Scotland by Police Scotland being engaged in this activity.\n\"It supports our ambitions to ensure that our reputation is strengthened on the international stage, demonstrates confidence in Scottish policing and that our officers and staff have the necessary skills and experience to police our increasingly multi-cultural communities in Scotland.\"\nPolice Scotland said all of the countries it operated in had full diplomatic relations with the UK.", "The invitation-only Facebook group Pantsuit Nation, which has 3.7 million subscribers, is backing the \"Pantsuit Drive\" launched by Meena Harris.\nThe software company policy manager said she wanted to help tackle the pay gap faced by women of colour.\nLibby Chamberlain, founder of Pantsuit Nation, is urging members to donate.\nThe page was named after Mrs Clinton's trademark trouser suits, which she was seen wearing throughout her campaign.\nIn an article for feminist newsletter Lenny Letter, Ms Harris said that the idea was born as she dropped off her dry cleaning near her San Francisco home.\nThe former Facebook employee, who studied at Stanford and Harvard, said she reflected on \"what an obvious privilege it is to even own a pantsuit, let alone to buy a new one for a special occasion\".\nShe added: \"In 2016, too many women still struggle to raise their families.

Now, we're going 97% of the way back. It really is a tremendous achievement,\" he told BBC News.\nNonetheless, scientists believe they are now at the very limits of what the veteran observatory can achieve technically, and it will most probably fall to Hubble's successor to look even deeper into space.\nThis is the James Webb Space Telescope, currently under construction and scheduled to launch in 2018.\nIts instruments will be tuned to the infrared - to a specific region of the electromagnetic spectrum where the light from the very first stars to shine in the Universe should still be detectable.\nThey are probably another 200 million light-years beyond even GN-z11.\nScientists are keen to probe these founding stars and the conditions in which they were born.\nThey were likely hot giants that grew out of the cold, neutral gas that pervaded the cosmos back then.\nThese behemoths would have burnt brilliant but brief lives, producing the very first heavy elements.\nThey would also have \"fried\" the neutral gas around them - ripping electrons off atoms - to produce the diffuse plasmas we still detect between nearby stars today.\nDr Oesch and colleagues say GN-z11 is one-25th the size of the Milky Way with just 1% of our galaxy's mass in stars.\n\"The surprising thing is how bright it is (for what it represents), and it's growing really fast, producing stars at a much faster rate,\" said the Yale astronomer.\n\"So, it's challenging some of our models, but it's showing galaxy build-up was well under way early on in the Universe, and it's a great preview for James Webb, which will be pushing even deeper to see the progenitors of this galaxy.\"\nGN-z11's identification was made with Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3, which was installed during the very last astronaut servicing mission, in 2009.\nWhen astronomers discuss distance in the cosmos, they use the term \"redshift\". This is a measure that describes the way light coming from far-off galaxies is \"stretched\" by the expansion of the Universe.\nThe higher the redshift number assigned to an object, the more distant it is and the earlier it is being viewed in cosmic history.\nBefore this Hubble observation, the galaxy measured spectroscopically to have the greatest separation from Earth was given a redshift of 8.68 (13.2 billion years in the past).\nGN-z11 has been assigned a redshift of 11.1, putting it some 200 million years closer to the time of the Big Bang.\nJWST will probably have to see back to when the Universe was only one or two percent of its current age - which corresponds to about 100 to 250 million years after the Big Bang.

However, party secretary Matthew Richardson and chief of staff Raheem Kassam both left the party.\nSeveral senior figures - including deputy leader Suzanne Evans and donors Arron Banks and Richard Desmond - declared their support for Mr Farage.\nBut party treasurer Hugh Williams, donor Stuart Wheeler and ex-MEP Godfrey Bloom all suggested he should go, amid claims MEPs were under pressure to publicly support the leader.\nWhen asked on Question Time about Mr O'Flynn's comments, Mr Farage said that although he was disappointed by the remarks, people were merely \"letting off steam and... fighting personal wars\"  after a high-pressured election campaign.\nPressed on why he had not honoured his pledge to resign if he failed to be elected to Kent's Thanet South seat, Mr Farage repeated that he had formally offered his resignation but that it had been rejected.\n\"The level of support for me in the party is phenomenal and, frankly, to go through a leadership contest at a time when [David] Cameron says he's renegotiating our relationship with the European Union would be a massive, massive mistake.\"", "On Thursday, two satellites will launch from French Guiana to begin the process of rolling out Galileo - Europe's multi-billion-euro version of the American Global Positioning System (GPS).\nIf that were not significant enough, the spacecraft will ride to orbit on the first Russian Soyuz rocket to operate from Western territory.\nI'll talk more of Galileo later in the week, but I want to concentrate on Soyuz for this posting.\nFormally initiated by European space ministers in 2003, the new Soyuz launch complex has been constructed at Europe's spaceport - the Guiana Space Centre (CSG - Centre Spatial Guyanais).\nIt is inside the Sinnamary commune about 15km up the coast from the Kourou commune where the pad was built for Europe's heavy-lift workhorse, the Ariane 5 rocket.\nEngineers have cleared an area of jungle to build a 120ha, near-facsimile of the Soyuz facilities used through the decades at Baikonur, in Kazakhstan, and Plesetsk, in northern Russia.\nThose familiar with TV pictures of Baikonur will instantly recognise the giant flame bowl that deflects the exhaust gases and noise away from the rocket as it begins its ascent. Having stood in the new bowl a couple of times myself, I can attest to its immense scale - 250,000 cubic metres of rock and earth had to be dug out of the ground to make it.\nPresent also is a 700m-long railway to take the rocket from its integration building, the MIK, to the pad, where, just as in Baikonur and Plesetsk, the four-stage vehicle is raised into the vertical position ready for its mission. Bright yellow and blue support towers hold the rocket in place.\n\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" they say, and the purpose of all this deja vu is to ensure the new Sinnamary home of Soyuz stays as true as possible to a very successful launch heritage.\nThere are differences, of course - some a little less obvious to the casual eye.\nThe Soyuz-ST, the vehicle that will be used in French Guiana, has a bigger clam-shell fairing enclosing its satellites - 4.11m in diameter compared to 3m on a \"classical\" Soyuz.\nIt's also got a digital flight control system and a modified upper stage. But these \"evolutions\" have all been tested in launches from Baikonur already, and so cannot really be described as \"new\" for Thursday.\nAnother \"under the skin\" change concerns the method used to terminate a flight if it goes wrong.\nBack in Kazakhstan or Russia, the detection of an anomaly results in an automatic engine shutdown. With no power, the rocket simply falls from the sky and is destroyed when it hits the ground.\n\"In French Guiana, this will be same - plus, we will have the capacity to telecommand to stop the engine,\" explained Jean-Marc Astorg, from the French space agency (Cnes), who has led the Soyuz in French Guiana project.\n\"So, there will be a Cnes officer who will be following the flight, and if the trajectory is not nominal - he will push a button. It's an additional safety measure.\"\nPerhaps the most noticeable difference in operation is the 52m-tall mobile gantry, which will be used to install the satellites on top of the rocket.\nIn Baikonur and Plesetsk, the satellites are always attached to the Soyuz while the rocket is still in the horizontal. But the spacecraft preparation facilities at the CSG are set up to do it in the vertical, and so the new gantry has been developed to fit with European custom and practice.\n\"It also means that if we wanted to change a payload from a Soyuz to an Ariane 5, or from an Ariane 5 to a Soyuz - that would be easy. And we need the gantry for environmental reasons. There are heavy rains in French Guiana, mosquitoes even - so it is better to protect the people working there.\"\nHowever, getting the gantry built in Russia, shipped to French Guiana, and then assembled and running smoothly on its bogeys, proved quite a struggle. This one item alone added over a year to the project timeline and significantly increased its final cost.\nBasing Soyuz in French Guiana should give the rocket a new lease of life. By launching closer to the equator, the rocket receives a bigger boost from the Earth's rotation, meaning it can lift nearly double the mass of a normal Baikonur payload - a maximum of three tonnes, as opposed to 1.7 tonnes, into a geosynchronous orbit 36,000km above the Earth.\nAnd the \"European Soyuz\" should be a fillip for Arianespace, the company set up to market and operate the Ariane rockets.\nWith a new small vehicle called Vega also set to debut early next year, Arianespace will soon offer the full portfolio of launch services from CSG.\nAriane will put in orbit the really big telecommunications satellites, Soyuz will loft the medium-class spacecraft, and Vega will take care of the compact scientific payloads.\n\"The talks about Soyuz in French Guiana started in the late 90s when we began the co-operation with Soyuz at Baikonur with [our subsidiary] Starsem, and in parallel there was - I would say - an opinion shared in Russia and Europe that it could be interesting to build a Soyuz launch pad in French Guiana,\" Jean-Yves Le Gall, the chairman and CEO of Arianespace, told me.\n\"For the Russians, the advantage is obvious - to have more launches and so to produce more launch vehicles. And for the Europeans, it was clear that the Ariane 5 would become bigger and bigger, and so we needed a mid-class launch vehicle.\n\"Developing a mid-class launch vehicle in Europe would have cost between three and five billion euros, and building the Soyuz launch pad has been just - if I can say 'just' - around 400 million euros,\" he explained.\n\"The other benefit is that we are able to launch from French territory some satellites with classified components that cannot be sent to Russia or Kazakhstan - for instance, Galileo. For Galileo, we are obliged to launch from French territory.\"\nAt the moment, Soyuz is used at Baikonur to launch astronauts to the International Space Station. No-one is talking about human missions for CSG yet, but the space in the jungle is there to build the additional facilities if that option is ever taken up.\nUPDATE (09/11/2011):  I should add that before a Soyuz manned mission could ever fly from Sinnamary, considerable modifications would need to be made to its TMA capsule, which was designed to come back on land. A French Guiana launch would necessitate a contingency for an abort over the ocean, and getting the crew out of an unmodified capsule in water would be precarious to say the least.", "The whitewashed walls of his house are pockmarked with blast marks and jagged holes gouged by flying shrapnel.\n\"Yesterday at 5.15 in the afternoon,\" he told me, \"came an explosion from Yemen.

Today the Houthis remain in control of much of Yemen and the death toll keeps mounting.\nBoth sides are accused of recklessly targeting civilians - but the UN has said the majority of casualties have been caused by coalition air strikes, a view disputed by both the Saudis and the Yemeni government.\nIn a guest palace in Riyadh, where exiled members of the Yemeni government gather, I met Rajhi Badi, their spokesman. He was unequivocal as to where the blame lies.\n\"There's only one reason for the destruction in Yemen. It's the Houthis and the forces of ex-President Saleh.\n\"They seized the government's weapons and are using them against Yemeni civilians in built-up areas,\" Mr Badi said.\nBut to hear first-hand how the Saudis account for so many civilian deaths, I went to the coalition headquarters in Riyadh to question the Saudi-led command on how they choose their targets, and - more importantly - what measures they take to avoid those civilian casualties.\nKing Salman Air base is a huge, sprawling, well-guarded base on the edge of Riyadh.\nOn one of its roundabouts a British-built Tornado jet is mounted, testimony to the multibillion pound ongoing defence sales relationship between Britain and the Royal Saudi Air Force.\nInside the command and control centre there are flags from 11 nations, and uniformed staff and intelligence officers working, from several Arab countries - notably Egypt, the UAE and Jordan, as well as Saudi Arabia.\nA dynamic, digital map on the wall display shows the movement of every aircraft on or approaching Yemen.\nThe coalition has complete air superiority in this war - the Houthis and their backers no longer have an air force.\nIn a large chamber called the \"War Room\" a digital chart details the line-up of inbound combat aircraft heading for Yemen.\nThis is the daily \"Air Tasking Order Schedule\". It shows which aircraft are in the air, from which country, their callsigns, and their intended targets (e.g. Egypt - F16 - Callsign Viper - Time on target 1600 - Killbox grid etc.).\nSenior Saudi officers inside the command and control centre insist that when choosing targets in Yemen the coalition abides by the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) and that every precaution is taken to avoid civilian casualties.\nYet reports from the ground describe schools, hospitals, factories and social gatherings all being hit from the air.\nThe worst single event was on 8 October 2016 when a double air strike by a coalition warplane hit a packed funeral hall in the capital Sanaa, killing 140 people, mostly civilians.\nThe Saudi-led coalition has since admitted it was carried out in error and has offered compensation.\nI put it to Maj Gen Ahmed Al-Assiri, the coalition spokesman, that both international aid organisations and the UN blame air strikes for 60% of civilian casualties.\nHe responded by accusing the UN of being effectively spoon-fed false statistics by the Houthi rebels.\n\"I think it is a wrong number or it is an exaggerated number when they say 60% of the casualties in Yemen are due to the air strikes.\n\"They are not on the ground, they are just in Sanaa  and they write a report which the Houthis are giving to them.\"\nThe Saudi officers went to great lengths to insist they comply with international Rules of Engagement (ROE) and the LOAC.\nThey showed me their \"No-Strike List\" (NSL) which includes more than 30,000 sites all over Yemen, including refugee camps and hospitals.\nThose Rules of Engagement state clearly:\nThey also explained their \"Targeting Cycle\", a circular chart detailing how air strikes are planned and executed, including a sign-off by a lawyer for every target chosen by the intelligence cell.\n\"If we plan a target,\" a senior Saudi intelligence officer told me, \"it's going to go through this cycle. If it's close to a mosque or a hospital then we don't hit it.\"\nBut I pointed out this is exactly what has been happening, repeatedly, in Yemen, for the past 20 months.\nCoalition officers admit there have been some mistakes - but they reminded me that even the US Air Force, with its vast experience, has hit wrong targets in Afghanistan and recently at Deir Az-zour in Syria.\n\"When you conduct a war in such circumstances,\" said Maj Gen al-Assiri referring to Yemen, \"where the militias melt in with the civilians, it is too difficult.\n\"Mistakes could happen, and we do what is necessary to protect the civilians. We are here to protect the civilians, we are not here to harm the civilians,\" he added.\nSo what is Britain's role exactly in this messy, seemingly unwinnable war in Yemen?\nBritain supplies Tornado and Typhoon aircraft and precision-guided munitions to the Saudi government under defence deals concluded before this war began.\nSince the air strikes started in March 2015, the UK has sold over \u00c2\u00a33.3bn ($4.1bn) worth of defence equipment to Saudi Arabia with more planned.\nThis has prompted some campaigners to suggest that Britain is complicit in the carnage afflicting Yemen.\nThe British government's position is that Saudi Arabia is an ally and that it supports its UN-backed actions to restore the legitimate Yemeni government to power.\n\"This is a legitimate request by the Saudis and the coalition to respond to President Hadi and (UNSC) Resolution 2216 in support of the aggression by the Houthis,\" says the Foreign Office Minister responsible for the Middle East, Tobias Ellwood, MP.\n\"But mistakes have been made, there's no doubt about that. Attacks have taken place which shouldn't have taken place, hitting targets on the ground, collateral damage taking place. They need to learn from this.\"\nWhitehall says RAF personnel placed inside coalition HQ are not involved in the targeting, that they are there to report back as well as to pass on to the Saudi-led coalition their expertise about best practice in avoiding civilian casualties.\nThe Saudis told me that their air force \"takes its Paveway 4 Collateral Damage Chart from the UK'.\nThis is an interactive diagram composed of a series of questions that help planners decide whether or not a target is at risk of collateral damage (i.e. hitting civilians).\nBut regardless of whatever rules are followed in military planning cells in Riyadh, the fact remains that in Yemen, civilians are getting killed and injured by both sides.\nThe UK government was concerned enough about the funeral bombing in October that the Prime Minister sent the FCO Minister down to Riyadh to press the Saudi and exiled Yemeni governments for a full explanation, which duly followed.\nFrom my several recent visits to Saudi Arabia I get the strong impression that the Saudis never expected the Houthis to hold out as long as they have.\nBy now, they expected them to have effectively sued for peace, accepted a purely political role in a future Yemeni government and handed over their heavy weapons to the UN.\nThat still hasn't happened, and for the Saudis this is a red line.\nTime and again they have said they will not allow an armed militia, backed by their rival Iran, to hold onto power illegally in Yemen.\nUntil one side or the other backs down, this war shows no sign of ending.", "Take our quiz to find out how heavily you can dino-score.", "It also estimated Glasgow itself gained \u00a3390m.

The Israelis say the wall and other parts of the separation barrier are vital for the security of their people. But for Palestinians the wall is tangible symbol of what they say is Israel's intention to grab as much land as possible.\nThe invitation to Rome for President Peres of Israel and the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is an intriguing development, at a time when negotiations have collapsed. The Pope's spokesman said it was a papal peace initiative, based on the Pope's moral and spiritual authority.\n\"The time has come to put an end to this situation which has become increasingly unacceptable,\" the Pope said on Sunday as he met Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.\nHe talked of the \"tragic consequences of the protracted conflict\" and the need \"to intensify efforts and initiatives\" to create a stable peace - based on a two-state solution.\nHe later held an open-air Mass for 8,000 local Christians by Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity, during which he said he wished to invite Mr Abbas and Mr Peres to join him at the Vatican \"in heartfelt prayer to God for the gift of peace\".\nThe Pope's spokesman, Federico Lombardi, told the BBC the move was papal peace initiative and believed to be the first of its kind.\nPope Francis has insisted the purpose of his Middle East trip is purely religious, but his first speech on his arrival in Bethlehem showed he is also willing to address pressing political issues, correspondents say.\nOn his way to Bethlehem, he stopped to pray at an 8m concrete wall that is part of the barrier Israel is building in and around the West Bank.\nThe Pope rested his head against the wall - which Israel says is needed for security, but the Palestinians see as a land grab - near graffiti reading: \"Free Palestine.\"\nPalestinian officials have noted that Pope Francis is the first pontiff to travel directly to the West Bank rather than enter via Israel: Many Palestinians see that as a recognition of their push for full statehood.\nIsrael has issued restraining orders against several Jewish right-wing activists this week over concerns that they could try to disrupt the visit.\nTwenty-six people were arrested overnight for throwing stones and bottles at police during a protest at a holy site on Mount Zion, reports say.\nThe Pope's tour began on Saturday with a visit to Jordan.\nOn Monday he is due to visit the al-Aqsa mosque complex in Jerusalem's Old City followed by the Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall.\nPope Francis will be the fourth leader of the modern Roman Catholic Church to visit Jerusalem, after Popes Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who went there in 2009.", "The report is co-authored by Professor David Nutt, the former government chief drugs adviser who was sacked in 2009.\nIt ranked 20 drugs on 16 measures of harm to users and to wider society.\nHeroin, crack and crystal meth were deemed worst for individuals, with alcohol, heroin and crack cocaine worst for society, and alcohol worst overall.\nThe study by the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs also said tobacco and cocaine were judged to be equally harmful, while ecstasy and LSD were among the least damaging.\nProfessor Nutt refused to leave the drugs debate when he was sacked from his official post by the former Labour Home Secretary, Alan Johnson.\nHe went on to form the Independent Scientific Committee on Drugs, which says it aims to investigate the drug issue without any political interference.\nOne of its other members is Dr Les King, another former government adviser who quit over Prof Nutt's treatment.\nMembers of the group, joined by two other experts, scored each drug for harms including mental and physical damage, addiction, crime and costs to the economy and communities.\nThe study involved 16 criteria, including a drug's affects on users' physical and mental health, social harms including crime, \"family adversities\" and environmental damage, economic costs and \"international damage\".\nThe findings run contrary to the government's long-established drug classification system, but the paper's authors argue that their system - based on the consensus of experts - provides an accurate assessment of harm for policy makers.\n\"Our findings lend support to previous work in the UK and the Netherlands, confirming that the present drug classification systems have little relation to the evidence of harm,\" the paper says.\n\"They also accord with the conclusions of previous expert reports that aggressively targeting alcohol harms is a valid and necessary public health strategy.\"\nIn 2007, Prof Nutt and colleagues undertook a limited attempt to create a harm ranking system, sparking controversy over the criteria and the findings.\nThe new, more complex, system ranked alcohol as three times more harmful than cocaine or tobacco. Ecstasy was ranked as causing one-eighth the harm of alcohol.\nIt also contradicted the Home Office's decision to make the so-called legal high mephedrone a Class B drug, saying that alcohol was five times more harmful.\nThe rankings have been published to coincide with a conference on drugs policy, organised by Prof Nutt's committee.\nProf Nutt told the BBC: \"Overall, alcohol is the most harmful drug because it's so widely used.\n\"Crack cocaine is more addictive than alcohol but because alcohol is so widely used there are hundreds of thousands of people who crave alcohol every day, and those people will go to extraordinary lengths to get it.\"\nHe said it was important to separate harm to individuals and harm to society.\nThe Lancet paper written by Prof Nutt, Dr King and Dr Lawrence Phillips, does not examine the harm caused to users by taking more than one drug at a time.\nGavin Partington, of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said alcohol abuse affected \"a minority\"  who needed \"education, treatment and enforcement\".\nMr Partington, who is the spokesman for the Wine and Spirit Trade Association, said millions of people enjoyed alcohol \"as part of a regular and enjoyable social drink\".\n\"Clearly alcohol misuse is a problem in the country and our real fear is that, by talking in such extreme terms, Professor Nutt and his colleagues risk switching people off from considering the real issues and the real action that is needed to tackle alcohol misuse,\" he said.\n\"We are talking about a minority.

London also has a higher rate than the national average at 5.6%.\nThe unemployment figures are based on the Labour Force Survey in which the ONS talks to about 40,000 households, or 100,000 individuals, every three months.\nAs it is a survey, the results are estimates and have a margin of error.\nFor example, the ONS is 95% confident that its estimate of a fall in unemployment of 52,000 is correct to within 81,000.\nThat means we cannot say with 95% confidence that unemployment has fallen at all, so the drop is described as not being statistically significant.", "Officers fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse thousands of protesters, with some of the gas leaking into the courtroom.\nMany demonstrators waved Turkish flags and chanted anti-government slogans, showing solidarity with the defendants.\nThe \"Ergenekon\" plot allegedly aimed to topple the AK Party government.\nSince Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan came to power, heading an Islamist-rooted movement, hundreds of military officers - serving or retired - have been arrested.\nThe investigations have undermined the traditionally powerful influence of the military in Turkish politics.\nThey also illustrate the deep divisions between secular nationalists - who see themselves as the heirs of the country's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk; and supporters of the government - who want to reduce the role of the military and make more room for the public practice of Islam, says the BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul.\nIt is not yet known when the hearing will resume, our correspondent says.\nThousands of people, from several towns, started arriving by coach very early on Monday to support the defendants at the prison-court complex in Silivri.\nProtesters shouted, \"We are the soldiers of Mustafa Kemal!\".

The former has said he is ready to talk.\nHowever, it would be no surprise if this did not happen, or did not end the fighting.\nMr Biong is concerned that Gen Gadet could link up with the Murle rebel leader, David Yau Yau, who also operates in Jonglei.\nIf he does, it would be quite a leap, since Gen Gadet had been one of the main army commanders charged with fighting David Yau Yau.\nNevertheless, in the topsy turvy world of South Sudanese military politics, it would not be totally surprising, not least because both have close links to Khartoum.\nThe states of Unity and Upper Nile should be watched closely too.\nIn both - and to a lesser extent in the Equatorias in the southernmost part of South Sudan - there are a lot of angry young men who are fed up with the president's leadership.\nIt would be no surprise if the fighting spread.\nMr Biong says the situation is dramatic enough to require wide-reaching measures.\nJuba should \"dissolve the current government to form a government of national unity guided by the SPLM to oversee the next elections in 2015, release all detainees and commit to reconciliation within the SPLM\", he says.\nThat seems unlikely, however.\nThe next phase may well be a military one, as both sides test out the limits of their strength.\nAll this is a result of the decades of war in southern Sudan, a political class dominated by ambition, and an ethnically divided and militarised society.\nJust over two years after it became independent, South Sudan is living out some of its worst fears.", "Former CBI boss John Cridland has

Manchester United in their place with a peerless first 40 minutes followed by resilience to maintain their 100% start to the season.\nThis was always going to be much more than the Manchester derby - this was as much about Mourinho against Guardiola on the Premier League stage, fighting for supremacy in Manchester.\nAnd this was Spaniard Guardiola's day on every level as City claimed the win and his celebrated methods were on show for all to see at Old Trafford, the fiercest enemy territory.\nMourinho was a chastened figure post-match, reduced to blaming referee Mark Clattenburg for not awarding two second half penalties for what he felt was City keeper Claudio Bravo's foul on Wayne Rooney and Nicolas Otamendi's handball.\nIt was an act of straw-clutching, although the Portuguese

struggled to cope with \"the dimension of the game\".\nThe Armenia captain was removed at half-time in a reshuffle that also saw Jesse Lingard taken off, Marcus Rashford and Ander Herrera sent on, and the completely anonymous \u00a389m midfield man Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini pushed forward, with Wayne Rooney shunted out to the right.\nIn other words - Mourinho's selection went wrong.\nHe said: \"I had two or three players in the first half that, if I know what is going to happen, I don't play them. This is football, though, and sometimes players disappoint managers.\n\"It's my fault because I'm the manager and it's always my fault because it's my choice.\"\nGuardiola was bold enough to play Kelechi Iheanacho as replacement for the suspended Sergio Aguero and the 19-year-old responded with his ninth goal from just 13 shots on target in the Premier League.\nAnd his introduction of Fernando for the youngster after 53 minutes demonstrated a pragmatism that is often overlooked amid Guardiola's purist instincts. He was prepared to use a shield when required.\nCity were also prepared to work for their success, running a total of 119.63km in comparison to United's 111.34km. Guardiola demands the full package from his players.\nIt was not all perfect as his selection of the uncertain Claudio Bravo in goal ran a fine line with failure - but all's well that ends well.\nThe embraces with long-time foe Mourinho at the start and finish were cordial enough - and if Guardiola did get around to having that glass of wine in the Old Trafford manager's office when his media duties were completed it would have tasted sweet.\nManchester City made their intentions clear when they lured the most coveted man in management to Etihad Stadium - and Guardiola's team have wasted no time in making big statements of their own.\nThe Catalan has opened up with four straight Premier League wins, this victory at Old Trafford marking them out as the team to beat in the title race this season.\nIt is, of course, early days but City's ability to win with key players either suspended, injured or working their way to full fitness means a significant marker was put down in this derby win.\nIt was a win achieved without the banned Aguero and without influential captain Vincent Kompany who is nearing a return, as is summer signing Ilkay Gundogan, who was also absent.\nLeroy Sane, the \u00a337m summer signing from Schalke, made a lively appearance as a substitute here and will be a formidable force when fully fit.\nJohn Stones was outstanding when United's second-half siege came, demonstrating why Guardiola was satisfied to spend \u00a347.5m on the young England defender to bring him from Everton.\nKevin de Bruyne was also a key figure, scoring one goal and being involved in the other. He has been directly involved in 32 goals in 46 appearances for Manchester City, scoring 17 and assisting in 15.\nAnd when Guardiola studies the statistics, an 81.8% passing success rate will please even this perfectionist, who expressed his satisfaction with this two-dimensional City display - glorious, clinical football in the first half and solid resilience in the second.\nCity restricted United to their fourth lowest home possession share in the Premier League since the 2003-04 season, just 39.9%\nManchester City's squad looked short of inspiration and motivation in the understated presence of Manuel Pellegrini last season - this problem looks to have been cured already by Guardiola.\nIt has been an impressive start.

He did not, allowing Zlatan Ibrahimovic to score and give United hope.\nGuardiola praised Bravo's willingness to take responsibility and is happy for his keeper to take a high-risk approach in exchange for the rewards he believes it brings.\nIt is too early to say whether Bravo will be an upgrade on the banished Hart but those who believe England's first-choice keeper has been sent into exile too soon will not have had their worries eased by this performance.\nThey will have to trust Guardiola's judgement - and he has not got anything wrong so far.\nWhile Mourinho bemoaned those players who struggled to cope with the unique demands of the Manchester derby, he had no such complaints about Marcus Rashford.\nMourinho said the 18-year-old looked like he was \"playing against Salford City under-18s\" in a second half performance that combined pace and a fearless approach - and almost an equaliser only for an offside Zlatan Ibrahimovic to get a touch on his goal-bound shot.\nThe question will continue and the clamour will grow for Rashford to start in an area of Mourinho's squad that is starting to look over-crowded.\nRashford was the player who put City on the back foot with his speed. It will be one of Mourinho's most urgent tasks to integrate this brilliant young talent into his team.\nIt then begs further questions, with Ibrahimovic seemingly untouchable as the main man, about where Rooney fits in and how Mourinho can shuffle his resources to maximise the potential of Rashford, Antony Martial, Mkhitaryan and Juan Mata.\nIbrahimovic had all of United's three shots on target as well as four of their six off target, so it is likely to a case of who plays with the 34-year-old Swede.\nRashford, on this showing, cannot be denied his starting place for much longer.", "Such a public  display of state brutality is unprecedented, but the ultra-secretive nature of the state means that observers can never really claim to know exactly what happened and when.\nThis is how the news came out.\nWhen Kim Jong-il died in 2011 it was Chang Song-thaek, the man who married his sister, who stood right behind the young new leader Kim Jong-un flanking the hearse as it processed through Pyongyang.\nHe is thought to have mentored his nephew during that crucial transition. Analysts believed he was a powerful force, advising his nephew as he took the helm.\nThe extraordinary news coming from North Korea was promptly leaked to the media by an opposition lawmaker. South Korean spies told a parliamentary committee that he had been removed from key posts and that two of his close confidantes had been publicly executed in mid-November.\nWithin hours South Korean intelligence told media that they had indeed heard that Chang Song-Thaek had been removed as vice-chairman of the North's top military body, the National Defence Commission  and as a department head of the ruling Workers' Party.\nStill without official confirmation from the north, it became clear that he had at least fallen out of favour when state TV edited him out of a documentary that had reportedly been broadcast nine times already.\nWhen The Great Comrade aired the weekend after news filtered out of Chang's dismissal, it was without pictures of the leader's uncle.  He had been comprehensively cut out the film.\nFinally, on 9 December, North Korea provided confirmation in an unprecedented manner by releasing images of Chang Song-thaek being removed from a public meeting.  Pictures released by the KCNA state news agency show uniformed guards approaching Chang Song-thaek.\nThe guards then appear to remove Mr Chang from his seat in full view of his former colleagues - some stare impassively at the proceedings  while others keep their eyes downturned.\nThe series of images played out on KCNA that day focused heavily on Kim Jong-un.\nSome analysts believe this was his way of augmenting power and asserting his independence. Others say it was his way of instilling fear into an older generation of leaders who may have felt they were better qualified to influence North Korea's future direction.\nBut breaking new ground again, KCNA state news agency published a violent and personal attack on Mr Chang, accusing him of forming factions against the state and of abuse of power, drug-taking and womanising.\nDays later, on 13 December, state media announced that Mr Chang had been tried for factionalism with the aim of overthrowing the state. It said he confessed and  condemns him  as  \"a traitor for all ages\".\nHe was sentenced to death and then the release reads: \"The decision was immediately executed\".\nPurge: Unprecedented N Korean media coverage\nNews of his execution on state television was accompanied by a denunciation of Chang as \"despicable human scum Jang, who was worse than a dog\" and accusing him of treachery and factionalism.\nPictures emerged of how the North Korean public received news of the execution. Some crowded around newspapers on public train platforms. While leaders have fallen out of favour in the past, what marks the latest events is the swift, brutal and public nature of Chang's fall from grace.\nWhat happens next is far from clear but many analysts agree that this could signal a wider purge.", "It will last four days, with the decision expected in the new year.\nTheresa May has said she is \"clear\" she expects to start talks on leaving the EU as planned by the end of March.\nCampaigners say MPs and peers have to scrutinise the government's plans beforehand, but ministers say they can decide without this happening.\nThe High Court ruled last Thursday that Parliament should have a say before the UK invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - which triggers up to two years of formal EU withdrawal talks.\nLabour has said it will not attempt to delay or scupper this process if a vote goes ahead but pressure is mounting on the government from the devolved legislatures.\nThe Scottish government is pressing for the Holyrood Parliament to be given a binding vote on Article 50 and will seek to oppose the UK government as it makes the case for its own involvement in the decision.\nThe Welsh government has also said it intends to intervene in the appeal process to clarify the implications of the judgement for the future of devolution in Wales and the respective powers of the UK executive and the Welsh Assembly.\nAnd Northern Ireland's top lawyer has said a separate legal challenge to Brexit should \"leapfrog\" the usual legal process and go directly to the Supreme Court.\nThe government said it was going to appeal almost as soon as the ruling came out and the Supreme Court has now granted permission - pushing through the process at a far faster pace than usual because of the importance of the case.\nAfter Lord Toulson's retirement this summer, the appeal will be heard by all 11 remaining Supreme Court justices, led by their President Lord Neuberger.\nAt the completion of legal submissions, the justices will reserve their decision to a date \"probably in the new year\", a spokesman for the court said.\nHe added: \"The Supreme Court will sit in its largest courtroom and make available a live video feed in the other two courtrooms in the building to enable as many members of the public as possible to observe proceedings.\n\"It should be added that, as with all Supreme Court proceedings, this appeal will be live streamed on our website, so it is not necessary for people to attend the building in person to watch the hearing.\"\nOn Monday, Mrs May said: \"We believe the government has got strong legal arguments.

There will be total transparency in this system, so you will have information about all the work in this panel\u2026 and, of course, as independent scientists they can talk to the press.\"\nHe added that staff and several million euros per year would be found to support the panel and to facilitate contacts and exchange of information with the external academies.\nWednesday's meeting with Mr Juncker was also an opportunity for the visiting group of internationally awarded scientists (Jules Hoffmann, Serge Haroche, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lov\u00e1sz, Jean Tirole and Edvard Ingjald Moser, and Sir Paul) to discuss the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI).\nThis is a stimulus package designed to invigorate the flagging EU economy.\nVarious areas of the EU budget are making a contribution, but it is the money being taken from science pot (Horizon 2020) that has so exercised the research leaders.\nThey think it sends the wrong signal about the importance Europe places on R&D.\nMr Juncker tried to reassure them that the slice being taken from Horizon 2020 would actually pay dividends in the long run. And he told them that he was working to make sure that any potential short-term impact on fundamental research was minimised as much as possible.\nSir Paul said his fellow scientists had no objection to the EFSI; indeed, they thought it a very good idea.  However, using Horizon 2020 money was not the way to fund it.\n\"Science, and the generation of knowledge, is at the basis of all sustainable economic growth and the public good, and to cut it at all is a bad thing,\" he argued.\n\"And we are seeing movement to try and reduce those cuts. We, of course, would like to see those cuts kept to a minimum, and we will continue to work in that direction. But it was a meeting of minds, and I'm optimistic that we will at least make some good progress in achieving [the right] outcome on science funding.\"\nDermot Kelleher, president of the Federation of European Academies of Medicine, said he \"very much welcomed\" the proposal to involve Europe's many eminent academies more directly in scientific advice.\nHe said that the two proposals, of a formal scheme for advice from the academies as well as an appointed expert panel, would hopefully prove complementary.\n\"It's possible that the internal panel might at times disagree with the advice given by the academies, but I think it's more likely that we would be able to reach a consensus,\" Prof Kelleher told the BBC.\nHe also noted that the new system, if it is well structured and resourced, could prove useful for avoiding controversies like the Horizon 2020 funding dispute, which scientists saw as a \"raid\" on their research budget.\n\"We think this is a really good opportunity to begin to try and shape things in a proactive way, rather than coming in retrospectively and trying to fix problems that we believe have arisen,\" said Prof Kelleher, from Imperial College London and a fellow of the UK's Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\"So if you take the issues around Horizon 2020 - the involvement of academies in science advice might allow those decisions to be made in a more consensual way.

But an alternative route for major pharmaceutical companies is to get approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), which is a decentralised agency of the EU.\nThrough this centralised procedure, companies can get the go-ahead for medicines to be marketed across all member states. Typically, manufacturers of drugs to treat cancer and rare diseases use this central approval route.\nThe EMA is run by regulators from member states who staff its committees so there is input from across the EU for each approval. That means there does not need to be a separate national process and, once granted by the EMA, the centralised authorisation is valid both in member states and countries in the European Economic Area (EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The EMA is based in London.\nSo what happens if there is a vote for the UK to leave? It seems certain that the EMA would move its headquarters out of London to an EU country. Some in the pharma world argue that this will in itself reduce the importance of this country in the eyes of the global drug companies.\nIf the UK decides to negotiate to stay in the EEA there would not, in practice, be much difference to regulation. But if the UK stays out of the EEA, drug companies would need to go through a separate process with British regulators for new products as the centralised European route would not be applicable to the UK.\nMost leading players in the world of big pharma have come out in favour of Britain remaining in the EU, arguing that being outside the EMA process will deter manufacturers from selling some new drugs in this country.  The other side of the argument is that Switzerland is not a member of the EEA and has a well-established pharma industry with big names such as Hoffman-La Roche and Novartis.\nDrug trials are currently carried out on a national level, with companies needing to approach each regulator and ethics committee separately.  There is a move to harmonise this procedure across the EU over the next few years, allowing a single entry point for companies that wish to carry out trials of a new drug on patients in different countries.\nThe Leave campaign argues that the existing EU Clinical Trials Directive has damaged medical research and innovation in the UK. The Commons Science and Technology Committee said in a recent report: \"Weaknesses in the 2001 Clinical Trials Directive significantly increased the administrative burden and cost of running academic clinical trials and saw a reduction in trials taking place in Europe.\" But it went on to add that the new regulations due to take effect in 2018 appeared to be an improvement.\nThe pharma industry argues that the UK is involved in about 40% of all adult rare diseases trials in the EU at present, but this would be undermined by a change of status.  Being outside the EU, the industry claims, would mean the UK was not part of the harmonised procedure and so might lose out on some trials that might otherwise benefit patients.\nOfficials at the National Eczema Society have said they have been informed by two US companies that trials of new treatments would not take place in the UK in the event of Brexit.\nBut the EMA has been criticised for a bureaucratic and slow-moving process, which has not helped patients desperate for life-preserving drugs.  Recent media reports suggested that European approval of a breast cancer drug, palbociclib, which helps the slow the development of tumours, had been held up at a time when US regulators had fast-tracked its adoption.\nThe industry points out, however, that the approval documentation was submitted to EU regulators 10 months after the American Federal Drugs Administration.\nFew would disagree that the result of the referendum vote is important for drug companies and their products.

These are all real-world examples of howlers by auto-translation software.\nJoking aside, poor translations can have big implications for firms who run the risk of offending customers and losing business, or at least looking very amateurish.\nYet we keep being promised that machine learning and natural language processing will soon make flawless, near-instantaneous translation a reality.\nSo how long will businesses have to wait?\nIn January, Skype rolled out its real-time translation software, which allows voice-to-voice translation in seven languages.\nBut even this hi-tech development was not without its teething problems, randomly turning Mandarin words into obscenities on one occasion.\nThe glitch was spotted by photographer Tom Carter who was in China shooting a Skype commercial and had been using it to speak to people in Mandarin.\nWhen he said: \"It's nice to talk to you\" to a local scout in Yangshuo, Skype translated it into a very offensive stream of swear words.\nThe issue was blamed on how the Great Firewall - China's way of censoring the web - had interrupted the Skype conversation.\nTranslation programs, such as Google Translate, have traditionally been built around phrase-based statistical machine translation.\nThis works by analysing a back catalogue of texts that have already been translated - such as academic papers and glossaries. It analyses them in parallel in both their original and target languages, then uses statistical probabilities to select the most appropriate translation.\nIts effectiveness depends greatly on the quality of the original language samples and it's prone to mistakes, often sounding clunky and mechanical.\nFor this reason, Alan Packer, director of engineering language technology at Facebook, said recently that statistical machine translation was reaching \"the end of its natural life\".\nInstead, translation tech is now moving towards artificial neural networks. These are structured similarly to the human brain and use complex algorithms to select and use the appropriate translation.\nBut rather than just translate the words, a neural network can learn metaphors and the meaning behind the language, allowing it to select a translation that means the same thing to a different culture, rather than a direct literal translation which may in some cases cause offence.\nFacebook, which carries out up to two billion translations a day in 40 languages, plans to roll out such a system later this year.\nSearch giant Google, too - which now offers 103 languages covering 99% of the online population - is also reported to be working on switching its translation service over to neural networks.\nBut it has not said publicly how soon it plans to make that transition.\nBut before you think auto-translation is on the verge of perfection, think again.\nProfessor Philipp Koehn, a computer scientist and expert in translation technology at the University of Edinburgh, tells the BBC there is still some way to go.\n\"There are very hard problems with semantics and knowledge representation that have to be solved first, and that we are not close to solving,\" he says.\n\"The main challenges are when there is less explicit information in the source language than what is needed for generating proper target language.\"\nFor example, Chinese doesn't have the equivalent use of plurals, verb tenses, or pronouns as in English, which makes exact translation very difficult, he says.\nAnd English doesn't use gendered nouns, which makes things tricky when translating into languages that do, such as French, Italian and German.\nUntil these challenges are overcome, mistranslations are likely to continue, whether that's Chinese bus routes changing Sichuan Normal University Campus Station to The University Jackie Chan Campus Station, or restaurant owners calling their establishments \"Translate Server Error\".\nAlthough translation technology may be improving rapidly, the cost of failure is potentially huge, so many businesses are unwilling to put their faith in it entirely.\nClem Chambers is chief executive of ADVFN, a global stocks and shares information website that covers over 70 stock exchanges around the globe.\nHe says: \"For us, when it comes to creating geographic and language-targeted websites, nothing beats having native speakers who actually have a thorough understanding of the financial markets.\n\"Translation tech has come a long way and can provide good literal translations, but what we need is something that really speaks the language of the local end user, with all the subtleties and colloquialisms specific to their country.\"\nIn other words, translation tech has its uses, but rely on it entirely at your peril.\nFollow Technology of Business editor @matthew_wall on Twitter\nClick here for more Technology of Business features\u007f", "Bodnant Welsh Food's ex-managing director Chris Morton made \"shocking comments\" the hearing was told.\nThe sexual discrimination case, held in Mold, Flintshire, was brought by the former head of human resources at the Conwy Valley business, Jackie Atkinson.\nMr Morton said he was shocked to receive the complaint in which she accused him of bullying.\nMiss Atkinson claimed she was made redundant because she objected to Mr Morton's homophobic remarks about gay employees.\nMr Morton, who has since retired, said the redundancy decision was made on a \"business, needs-must basis\".\nThe transgender employee, referred to as \"A\" in the hearing, was transitioning from male to female.\nThe tribunal heard that during a meeting to discuss A's decision to transition, Mr Morton put his head in his hands and said \"not another one\".\nHe admitted emailing Miss Atkinson asking for three options to dismiss A and was told there were none.\nHe told the panel it was not because A was transitioning, but due to \"all the fuss and pantomime\" around it.\nMr Morton denied making the comments and also said he did remember using the term \"feminist wittering\" towards Miss Atkinson during a staff meeting when she offered an idea as part of a brainstorming session.\nMiss Atkinson, who also ran the farmhouse accommodation, worked at the food centre from May 2013 until May 2015.\nThe judgement was reserved to a later date.", "Adrian Chadwick, 47, from Marton, Middlesbrough, fell from Lime Kilns last May.\nHe spent several weeks in hospital and had to wear a frame around his body for more than five months.\nMr Chadwick, a father-of-two, said it was like the \"cavalry had arrived\" when the air ambulance came.\nHe was anesthetised once aboard the helicopter and taken to Newcastle's Riyal Victoria Infirmary.\nHe was then transferred to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough after seven days.\nMr Chadwick said: \"I'm still recovering now.

The report will also look at the impact the plans would have on residents and businesses, with the results published in June.\nA public consultation on a draft action plan would then be held some time before August.\nProposals being considered for the plan include extending evening parking restrictions, introducing parking fines on Sundays and extending permit holders' parking rights in pay-and-display parking bays.\nLesley Hinds, Edinburgh City Council's transport convener, said: \"We were absolutely delighted with the huge response to our consultation in the autumn and it's great to be moving on to the stage of finalising exactly which streets will become 20mph, provided the necessary Traffic Regulation Orders are secured.\n\"Edinburgh is taking a very bold step in introducing slower speeds for so much of its roads and we're aware that other cities in Scotland are watching our example keenly.\n\"There's obviously a lot of work to be done to raise public awareness between now and the first new limits coming into effect.\n\"It's undoubtedly a culture change for the whole city but we're very encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive response we've seen to the pilot project in South Edinburgh.\n\"Support for 20mph limits was already high before the pilot began but it increased even more once people tried out the slower speeds in practice.\"\nJohn Lauder, national director of Sustrans Scotland, said: \"It is fantastic to see Edinburgh Council rolling out 20mph speed limits across more and more streets in the capital.\n\"Sustrans wants to see increasing numbers of people choosing to travel actively on an everyday basis, whether on foot or by bike, and we think that reducing traffic speeds is a key way to helping achieve this.\n\"Many other towns and cities across Scotland will no doubt be watching Edinburgh closely as implementation of the new 20mph network gets under way.

This time, the rocket flew out of California.\nBoth missions saw the Falcon first-stages come back to Earth under control to drone ships that had been positioned out on the ocean.\nIt means SpaceX has now had 13 landing successes for those missions it has sought to recover the booster. That said, Friday's first-stage had a particularly hard landing, and looked bent over on the live video feed.\n\"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good,\" quipped SpaceX chief executive, Elon Musk, on Twitter.\nHis firm does not expect to recover every booster, because the flight profile required on many satellite launches will lead to re-entry speeds that are simply too fast to curtail with the available propellant.\nFriday's mission was launched from the US East Coast, from the Kennedy Space Center's famous Apollo and shuttle pad, 39A.\nThe \"second-hand\" Falcon 9 lifted off at 15:10 local time (1910 GMT).\nIts passenger, BulgariaSat-1, was dropped off in orbit, some 30 minutes later.\nThe spacecraft will be used to beam TV into homes in Bulgaria and Serbia.\nThe Falcon booster was last flown in January, to launch 10 satellites for the Iridium sat-phone and data-relay company. And it was another Iridium launch that topped out the weekend's activities.\nThis second mission, on a brand new Falcon, occurred on the West Coast, from the Vandenberg Air Force Base.\nIridium is in the midst of replacing its global network of satellites. Another 10 went up on this latest flight.\nSpaceX has another six launches on the books for Iridium, whose existing network of more than 60 spacecraft is now well past its design life.\nSunday's lift-off occurred at 13:25 local time (20:25 GMT). The returning booster on this occasion sported new titanium grid fins to help steer the vehicle back to its waiting drone ship.\nThe titanium ought to be more robust than the previous aluminium type, said Mr Musk, removing the requirement for repair or replacement.  This should speed the turnaround of future boosters for re-use.\n\"New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service,\" the CEO tweeted.\nIridium's business is mobile communications, providing connections to anyone who is not near a fixed line. These customers include the military, oil and gas platforms, ships and broadcasters.\nIncreasingly, it also includes remote machinery reporting in its status to a central server. This machine-to-machine service has a big future, especially as more and more devices are linked together in the coming, so-called \"internet of things\".\nThe new Iridium satellites also host payloads for two tracking companies. One of is Aireon, which aims to offer a service that reports the positions of aircraft by sensing their ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) transmissions. This would be useful in following planes that are beyond radar coverage, but could also help airlines plan more efficient routing.\nThe other hosted payload is for exactEarth, which does something very similar with ships. Large vessels transmit an Automatic Identification System message that can be sensed from orbit.\nAgain, shipping companies can use the tracking service to keep tabs on vessels and to plot the best available course to a port.\nJonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos", "The offences that led to convictions include sex crimes, assaults and possessing indecent images of children.\nHowever, only 25 of the 45 forces gave figures to the Press Association after a Freedom of Information request.\nA Home Office spokesman said measures had been introduced to improve standards of behaviour in the police.\nThe 20 forces that did not provide information either said they could not reveal the number of convictions because of the cost of retrieving the information, or did not respond to the request.\nPolice Scotland and the Police Service of Northern Ireland were among those not to provide the information.\nSeparate figures obtained from 18 forces showed that there are at least 295 officers and police community support officers (PCSOs) with convictions who are currently serving with the police.\nPolice convictions: How did your force respond?\nThe Home Office spokesman said: \"The vast majority of police officers in this country do their job honestly and with integrity. They put themselves in harm's way to protect the public.\n\"But the good work of the majority threatens to be damaged by a continuing series of events and revelations relating to police conduct.\n\"Over the last two years the Home Office has introduced a programme of measures to improve standards of behaviour in the police, including making the disciplinary system more independent and transparent through introducing hearings in public, preventing officers resigning or retiring to avoid dismissal, and - from next year - introducing legally qualified, independent chairs on misconduct hearing panels.\"\nPolice forces did not tell the Press Association the names of officers who had been involved in crimes, saying that it would breach data protection laws to identify them.\nAnalysis by BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw\nWhat the figures demonstrate is that, proportionately, the number of \"rotten apples\" in the police barrel is very small.\nYou might expect that, given that police are meant to enforce the law rather than break it, but sometimes newspaper headlines suggest the opposite.\nHowever, the refusal of so many police forces to provide conviction data is more troubling. Surely it's in each constabulary's interest to keep tabs on employees with a criminal record - and surely it's in the public interest for us to know, for, as Home Secretary Theresa May has recently reminded us, the police are the public and the public are the police.\nThe College of Policing has begun releasing details of the number of officers who leave the service for disciplinary reasons. Perhaps the College, the body which sets ethical standards for the service, should start collecting and publishing conviction data too.\nAmong the forces to provide figures to the Press Association:\nThere are 207,140 police workers in England and Wales according to the most recent government data - this figure includes police officers and PCSOs but also staff working in a support role. There are 17,295 full-time police officers at Police Scotland and 6,748 regular officers working for the Police Service of Northern Ireland, neither of which have PCSOs.\nThe highest-ranked officer to have been convicted in the three-year period was a detective chief superintendent at West Yorkshire Police.\nDavid Knopwood was sacked from the force for gross misconduct last year after admitting driving at nearly twice the legal alcohol limit.\nHe was banned from driving for 12 months and fined \u00c2\u00a31,000 at his court hearing last year.\nHe had failed a roadside breath test after being stopped by officers and admitted refusing to provide a further specimen.\nThe court hearing was told he drank two pints and then provided a roadside reading of 60 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath.

It is critical that victims know they can trust the police so that they have confidence to report crimes.

Many analysts expect that the US central bank will raise interest rates when it meets next month.", "Prof Noel Sharkey said that society as a whole needed to consider the impact of all types of sex robots.\nHis Foundation for Responsible Robotics has conducted a consultation on the issue.\nOnly a handful of companies were currently making sex robots, said Prof Sharkey.\nBut, he added, the upcoming robot revolution could change that.\nThe report, Our Sexual Future With Robots, was written to focus attention on an issue barely discussed at the moment, he said.\nThe report acknowledged that finding out how many people actually owned such robots was difficult because the companies that made them did not release the numbers.\nBut, said Prof Sharkey, it was time society woke up to a possible future where humans and robots had sex.\n\"We do need policymakers to look at it and the general public to decide what is acceptable and permissible,\" he said.\n\"We need to think as a society what we want to do about it. I don't know the answers - I am just asking the questions.\"\nCompanies making sex robots include Android Love Doll, Sex Bot and True Companion. Most have previously made realistic, silicone-skinned sex dolls and are now considering or starting to ship dolls that can move and speak.\nThe most advanced of these is San Diego-based Abyss Creations, which ships a product known as Real Doll and is due to release a sex doll with artificial intelligence later this year. Called Harmony, the robot moves its head and eyes and speaks via a tablet-enabled app.\nThe company has already released the app, which allows users to program moods and voices for an existing doll.\nThe report considers a few options for how such robots could be employed as:\nThe last of these was the most problematic, said Prof Sharkey.\nSex dolls that resemble children do exist, and a court in Canada is currently determining whether owning one is illegal.\nNewfoundland resident Kenneth Harrison ordered a doll from a Japanese business called Harumi Designs.\nThe company is on a Canadian watch-list, and the doll was intercepted at the airport. Mr Harrison was charged with possessing child pornography but has pleaded not guilty.\nIn Asia, there are already brothels that use adult sex dolls. And there are reports that a doll-maker operated one in Barcelona, although this has not been verified.\nDr Kathleen Richardson, a robot ethicist at De Montfort University, agreed with the report authors that child sex robots should be banned but stopped short of calling for a ban on all such sex dolls.\n\"The real problem here is not the dolls but the commercial sex trade. Sex robots are just another type of pornography,\" she said.\nShe believes such robots would inevitably \"increase social isolation\".\nShe also criticises the report for what she said is a failure to address the issue of gender.\n\"Why does the report have a picture of a male robot on the cover when we know that the doll market - which is driving this - is mainly female dolls?\n\"It is perpetrating the idea that this is gender-neutral, but the truth is that there are not many women buying such dolls, it is largely driven by men and male ideas of sexuality.\"\nProf Sharkey said that there was currently a mismatch between what those selling such dolls wanted their customers to believe about the dolls and the reality of what they offered.\n\"The manufacturers of sex robots want to create an experience as close to a human sexual encounter as possible,\" he said.\n\"But robots cannot feel love, tenderness or form emotional bonds. The best that robots can do is to fake it.\"\nSex robots are a relatively new phenomenon and an obvious next stage for sex dolls, which have become increasingly sophisticated in recent years. Most have silicone skin, articulated metal skeletons and realistic features such as hair and eyes.\nIn the main, these dolls are designed in female form, although Sinthetics has had some commercial success with its male sex dolls.\nBut Prof Sharkey has doubts about how human-like such dolls will become.\n\"I can't see them as being like humans in the next 50 years. They will always be slightly spooky, and their conversation skills now are awful,\" he said.\nDr Richardson also questioned whether such robots would become mainstream or even be possible technologically.\n\"The report assumes that you can create a functioning robot that can respond to humans, but in fact it is incredibly complex,\" she said", "The baby is believed to have suffocated at a holiday house in Saint-Pee-sur-Nivelle near the Spanish border, the BBC's Hugh Schofield said.\nThe family involved were believed to be a British couple and their two sons, aged five months and three, he said.\nThe father got up early on Saturday and returned to the bedroom later to find the baby dead, prosecutors told AFP.\nAccording to French media reports, an autopsy is due to be carried out in the next few days at Bordeaux.\nA spokeswoman for the UK Foreign Office said: \"We are in contact with local authorities following the arrest of a British national in the south of France.\"", "The process to replace Kathryn Stone has been plagued with problems.\nAlex Bunting, who lost a leg in an IRA bomb attack, said he would only believe the long wait for an appointment was over \"when they announce it on television\".\n\"We do need someone asap, because if we don't get them as soon as possible its going to get worse for victims,\" he told BBC NI's The View.\n\"They've told us about three times over this past year they were going to get someone appointed very soon and we're still waiting.\n\"I know the process is finished in this round. This is the second round of interviews for a commissioner. I have to say the say I'll believe it is the day they announce it on television.\"\nIn January, First Minister Peter Robinson told the assembly the first round had failed to produce a winner and there had been \"a disappointingly small pool of appointable candidates\".\nHowever, it is understood two people were judged to be appointable, but not appropriate for the role.\nMr Robinson said the salary for the post may have to be increased. It was re-advertised more widely and a second round of interviews was conducted in May.\nA spokesperson for the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister said the process was at \"an advanced stage\" and they hoped to make an announcement shortly.\nThe hiatus has caused a problem for the Victims Forum. Several members have left without being replaced because that can only be done by a commissioner.\nThe secretary to the Victims Commission, John Beggs, has been carrying out the role on an interim basis but said the situation had been \"extremely difficult.\"\n\"We have been able to get on with our research on victims issues,\" he said.\n\"We've been able to get on with our engagement with individuals and groups, [but] to bring that to a culmination we really need a commissioner to consider that advice and take it directly to ministers; to take it directly to government and to make sure it is acted upon and that is the missing part of the equation as it stands.\n\"I can't give opinion and commentary as a victims commissioner could under their legal authority, so in many ways a lot of the work we are doing goes unseen and unheard in the media and in the sector and that is very frustrating for us in the commission, particularly at a time when there are so many victims issue in the press and in the media.\"\nThe failure to appoint has been criticised by two former victims commissioners, Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt and Patricia MacBride.\nMr Nesbitt said Stormont was in danger of losing all credibility because it could not make difficult decisions.\nMs MacBride said it was \"appalling\" that victims and survivors were being put in a position where they were having to \"fight their own battles\" to get the help they needed.", "As French finance minister in 2008, she approved an award of \u20ac404m ($429m;

His support among the poor soared.\nMr Chavez's success in introducing a new constitution in 2000 signalled longer term ambitions, as he could now run for office again with the option of re-election.\nThe prospect of \"Chavismo\" becoming permanently established in Venezuela created a backlash among those who had benefited from the old order.\nA counter-revolution was soon under way and President Chavez was ousted from the presidential palace in April 2002.\nThe US did not plan the counter-revolution, but it almost certainly knew what was happening and did not warn the Venezuelan authorities.\nMr Chavez was restored to power in 48 hours by a military that at first appeared to have supported the coup and he immediately embarked on a vigorous campaign against his enemies at home and abroad.\nDomestically, Mr Chavez's targets included the traditional political class with its strong ties to the US.\nTo counter their influence in the media, President Chavez promoted state television and pressured the judiciary to restrict the influence of privately-owned means of communication.\nHe also replaced technocrats in the state oil company (PDVSA) with loyal supporters.\nVenezuela became increasingly politicised, with the debate focusing on the role of President Chavez himself.\nTo maintain political support, Mr Chavez expanded his social programmes using the income derived from high oil prices.\nMinimum wages were increased sharply and many Venezuelans were lifted out of poverty.\nOther social indicators, notably literacy, also improved and Mr Chavez and his political movement had little difficulty in defeating an opposition that was deeply divided and unable to adjust to the new Venezuelan realities.\nIn foreign affairs, President Chavez followed an aggressively anti-imperialist policy in which verbal attacks on the US became frequent.\nHe went out of his way to cultivate enemies of the US and deepened the relationship with Cuba.\nYet his most important goal was the building of an alliance among the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean that would fulfil the frustrated dream of his great hero, South American independence leader Simon Bolivar, two centuries before.\nThe first step towards the Bolivarian dream had been Petrocaribe - a scheme to provide cheap oil to the countries of Central America and the Caribbean that depend on imports.\nIt was hugely popular, with only Barbados refusing to take part.\nThis was followed by Alba, a regional integration scheme that would grow to include Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador, Honduras (until 2009) and Nicaragua, as well as a few small independent Caribbean states.\nVenezuela under Mr Chavez, along with Brazil under President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, also promoted a new regional architecture  designed to embrace all American states except the US and Canada.\nThis led to Unasur, the Union of South American countries, and a proposed Community of Latin American and Caribbean nations (Celac).\nIt also led to a development bank designed to counter the influence of the IMF.\nMr Chavez's ambitions to join Mercosur (the regional integration scheme founded by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) were long blocked by the Paraguayan senate.\nBut political upheaval in Paraguay led to the country being suspended from the bloc, so clearing the way for Venezuela to be admitted in July 2012.\nPresident Chavez's electoral success (he lost only one nationwide vote) did not rest, it is safe to say, on his foreign policy.\nThis was very clear in the presidential election in October 2012, which he won despite a strong challenge from the opposition.\nIt was due to the social policies that won him the enduring loyalty of the country's poorest strata as well as some support from the middle classes.\nBut his government's policies failed to address several problems that increasingly concern all sectors of society.\nThe first is the high level of common criminality, illustrated most clearly by the exceptionally high homicide rate.\nThe second is the level of inflation, which has been exacerbated by the devaluation of the currency despite the high oil price.\nThe third is the continuation of government corruption, including allegations of nepotism against the Chavez family, accusations they have long denied.\nFinally, there is the issue of mismanagement of state resources as a result of the politicisation of the bureaucracy, the judiciary and state-owned enterprises.\nAny successor to Hugo Chavez, whether from his own party or the opposition, will need to tackle these issues, but they will do so without the undoubted charisma that has sustained Chavez's popularity for many years. When that happens, Venezuela will embark on a new chapter in its 200-year history.\nProfessor Victor Bulmer-Thomas is Associate Fellow, Americas, Chatham House", "This breaking news story is being updated and more details will be published shortly.

And amid accusations that it was a bullying free-for-all, schools and parents were soon loudly complaining.\nAnd Mr Nash was doorstepped by tabloid reporters and TV crews.\nMr Nash says: \"My mum walked out one morning in her dressing gown to open the front gate for someone, and suddenly there were reporters asking her, 'Does Ted Nash live here?'\n\"She ran back inside, shouting to me, 'What have you done?'\"\nWith the story being widely reported across national UK newspapers, and on TV, Mr Nash shut down the website a few months later.\nA serial technology entrepreneur, who set up his first money-making website when he was just 12 years old, Mr Nash describes Little Gossip as \"an unbelievable learning curve\".\nHe says: \"As is more often the case, I came up with the idea for the website to solve my own problems.\n\"At school I was always much more interested in building a company. Because of that I felt that I had missed out on a huge amount of gossip and socialising, so I thought something like Little Gossip would be very useful, and it was started with good intentions.\n\"Unfortunately it was a sad state of affairs that you couldn't allow some people to be anonymous [without them abusing it], and we had to close it.\"\nNow chief executive of a start-up technology company called Tapdaq, which aims to help small mobile phone apps more easily grow user numbers, Mr Nash is already 13 years into a busy and eventful business career.\nAt 17 he made almost \u00c2\u00a33m when three million people around the world paid 99 cents to download an app he had developed called Face Rate, and then he subsequently spent 18 months helping Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper group, News UK, develop its mobile presence.\nBut Mr Nash says it all started when, aged 12, and on a family holiday in Spain, he was inspired by an 18-year-old he met who had made a decent amount of money by developing an early internet search engine.\n\"I saw all the material items that he had, and me being 12 I wanted that as well.\n\"It completely set off a spark in my head, and from that point onwards I was just fascinated by technology and the impact it can have. And, of course, the money it can make.\n\"At that age all I could think about was buying the next toy - literally. But [as] you get older you realise that the money is not so important, and that it is a subset for building something of value for other people to use.\"\nReturning to the UK, Mr Nash set to work on learning how to build websites, and still just 12, was successful with one of the first ones he built. Called Rediz, it was an online shopping index, with links to shopping websites.\nMr Nash was savvy enough to build up a user base, and he was soon getting paid by retailers for each customer who clicked through to their websites from his.\n\"I was earning the kind of money that 12-year-olds shouldn't, but I had to get my parents to sign all my contracts, because I was obviously too young.\"\nMany of Mr Nash's other websites, including an attempt at a search engine, were far less successful.\nHe says: \"From age 12 to 16, it was pretty much all trial and error. I built [metaphorically speaking] thousands of websites, the majority of which didn't see the light of day.\"\nSupport, advice and occasional investment along the way came from Steve Pankhurst, the founder of one-time UK social networking website Friends Reunited. Mr Nash had met Mr Pankhurst via his father.\nAfter Rediz, Mr Nash's next big hit was Face Rate, an app that measured - or at least tried to measure - how attractive a user was. It went viral, and Mr Nash says he \"made an obscene amount of money for a kid of that age\".\nThe ignominy of Little Gossip then followed, before Mr Nash helped the Times and Sunday Times newspapers improve their digital presence.\nMr Nash says his sole attention since 2013 has been London-based Tapdaq, which helps mobile phone apps cross-advertise on each other's platforms, thereby helping them to more easily build up user numbers. He says it has so far secured financial backing of $8m (\u00c2\u00a35.5m).\nThe ambitious Mr Nash has high hopes for the company, which he says \"could become a multibillion-dollar business\".\n\"For me being an entrepreneur is both a blessing and a curse,\" he says. \"I'm always thinking [of business ideas]. It keeps me awake at night.\"", "The proposals have been condemned by the UN refugee agency and human rights groups. They say they go against international rules on refugees.\nPrime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen has called the plan the \"most misunderstood bill in Denmark's history\".\nThe bill is expected to be voted on later in the month.\nThe government on Tuesday secured a parliamentary majority to alter the proposed legislation to allow the Danish authorities to seize migrants' cash and other individual items worth more than 10,000 kroner (\u00c2\u00a31,000; \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,340, $1,450).\nWedding rings and other items of sentimental value will not be included.\nThe move has been likened by some commentators to the treatment of Jews by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust.\nSeparately on Wednesday, the government announced it would extend temporary controls at its border with Germany for a further 20 days.\nThe controls were brought in on 4 January to prevent an influx of migrants after neighbouring Sweden imposed temporary controls on its borders.\nDenmark said on Wednesday that 31,000 border checks had taken place on its border with Germany in the past 10 days and 200 people had been refused entry.\n\"Refugees are welcome here,\" chanted crowds of Germans gathered at Munich railway station last September.\nA few months on and the mood in Germany and much of the rest of Europe is very different.\nConcerns over integration, the economic burden and security have risen sharply. In many countries, barbed wire has replaced open borders. And, after the Paris attacks, the Poles refused to take any migrants.\nThe New Year's Eve sex attacks in Cologne by men of a mainly migrant background has led to harsh questions about Western values and integration.\nSweden, traditionally welcoming to refugees, has introduced border checks, and Denmark has followed suit as it tries to dissuade migrants from coming. Europe is a much less hospitable place for migrants than it seemed last summer.\nThe ruling centre-right Venstre party - backed by its right-wing allies, the anti-immigration Danish People's Party, the Liberal Alliance and the Conservative People's Party - has promised to get tough on immigration since its election in June.\nIntegration Minister Inger Stojberg said the measures simply put migrants on an equal footing with jobless Danes, who must sell assets above a certain level to claim benefits.\nShe said the assets would help pay for housing, healthcare and some education.\nAnother heavily criticised part of the bill would delay the reunification of families for up to three years, up from the current one year.\nThe UN High Commission for Refugees, in its report on the proposed legislation, said the swift reunification of families was enshrined in a number of international conventions it called on Denmark to observe.\nThe bill also includes measures making it harder to obtain permanent residency and shortening temporary resident permits.\nResponding to the plan to seize valuables, UNHCR spokesman William Spindler told the BBC: \"Refugees have lost their homes and almost everything they possess.\n\"It beggars belief that somebody would want to strip them away from the little they have managed to salvage from their lives.\n\"Refugees need and deserve compassion, understanding, respect and solidarity.\"\nSofie Carsten Nielsen, an MP with the opposition Social Liberal party, said the bill was designed to \"send a signal to refugees... that here in Denmark it's very difficult to come in...\n\"You will be investigated and you will be ransacked and they will search your bags for every sort of belongings that you have.\"\nDenmark says 21,000 people applied for asylum in 2015 and it expects a similar number this year.\nNeighbouring Sweden took in 163,000 and Germany has had more than 1.1 million asylum requests.", "In its report on the Cancer Drugs Fund, the Public Accounts Committee said it was unacceptable that the benefit to patients was still not clear.\nThe fund was set up in 2010 to improve access to cancer drugs that would not be routinely available on the NHS.\nThe fund, which is expected to have cost \u00a31.27bn by April 2017, has helped more than 80,000 cancer patients.\nBefore any drugs can be given to patients on the NHS, they have to be recommended by the health watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which looks at how well they work and whether they are cost-effective.\nBut if drugs are not recommended or have yet to be appraised by NICE, the Cancer Drugs Fund can step in and choose to fund cancer treatment.\nThe fund was initially managed by strategic health authorities. But since April 2013, it has been managed by NHS England.\nThe MPs' committee says there is no evidence the fund is benefiting patients, extending lives or a good use of taxpayers' money.\nMoney has had to be diverted from primary care to cover two years of overspends.\nThe \u00a3480m budget for the two years from 2013 to 2015 was overspent by \u00a3167m.\nIts total budget, of \u00a31.27bn, takes the fund to April, when the system will be overhauled.\nThe MPs recommend more thorough information is collected about how patients are benefiting from the drugs.\nAnd they say tough decisions will need to be made about spending.\nThe fund has already had to drastically reduce the number of treatments it pays for, and the MPs' report questions whether it has done enough to fund medicines for rarer cancers.\nA spokesman for NHS England said: \"While we welcome the committee's support for a redesigned cancer drugs fund, we hope their explicit call for cuts to cancer drugs prices charged to the fund will be borne in mind as complex decisions on its future are taken in the next few months.\"", "The piece by Venetian artist Francesco Guardi, entitled \"Palace Stairs\", was taken shortly after Germany invaded.\nThe small painting depicts noblemen talking at the grand stairs of Venice's Doge Palace.\nBerlin hopes the move will revive talks over some 300,000 documents, including manuscripts by Mozart and Beethoven, that it wants to recover from Poland.\nGerman Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier handed the work over to his Polish counterpart Radoslaw Sikorski at a ceremony on Monday.\nAfter World War Two, the painting went to the University of Heidelberg and then to the State Gallery of Baden-Wuerttemberg.\nIt was recognised as belonging to Poland in the late 1990s.\nBut political differences between Warsaw and Berlin over the broader issue of art lost during the war prevented a deal from being reached sooner.\n\"This painting has been on a long odyssey,\" Mr Steinmeier said.\n\"[It represents] the difficult history that connects our two countries.\"\nPoland is still searching for thousands of artefacts looted from its museums and private collections during the war, although many items are believed to have been destroyed during the war.\nMr Steinmeier said he hoped the move would \"be a signal to restart the stalled German-Polish dialogue on cultural artefacts\".\nGermany has long sought the return of some 300,000 books, drawings and manuscripts -

around a quarter of the total plan cost.\nThe report also said there was very little transparency over what happens to clients' money after they had paid it.\nThe National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) said it had been campaigning for tighter rules since November last year.\n\"In our view, the current lack of comprehensive oversight is allowing sharp sales practices and a lack of transparency to flourish in parts of the market,\" said Alison Crake, president of the NAFD.\n\"Members have reported numerous instances to us where funeral plan providers have not acted in the best interests of either the public who have paid for funeral plans, or the funeral directors who will care for them.\"\nThe industry is currently subject only to voluntary regulation, by the Funeral Planning Authority (FPA), and there is no ombudsman service for consumers to complain to.\nHowever, the report argues that funeral plans are financial products and should therefore be regulated by the FCA.", "General manager Kris Radlinski confirmed Burgess' exit at a fan forum.\n\"We did everything we could but he wants to experience the Sydney lifestyle,\" said Radlinski.\nBurgess, 20, scored a try in Wigan's Grand Final defeat by St Helens and was selected in England's squad for the end-of-season Four Nations tournament.\nMeanwhile, 19-year-old prop Ryan Sutton and 22-year-old half-back Sam Powell have agreed four-year contracts with the Warriors, who begin the new campaign with an away fixture at Widnes on 5 February.", "Giles suffered a hamstring strain for his region in a European Challenge Cup win over Lyon in January.\nThe Osprey was an unused replacement when Wales beat Japan in November.\n\"The intensity in training and the accuracy you need was a bit of a step up, but it was a good experience for me,\" he told BBC Wales Sport.\n\"It's a dream for every young boy [to play for Wales] so if it comes it comes and if it doesn't I'll have to work harder, but hopefully that time will come pretty soon.\"\nGiles has scored 12 tries in 11 matches for Ospreys in his first full season with the region's first team.\n\"As a winger you like to get on the end of passes and do some magic,\" he said.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"It's been a good first pro season and I'm totally enjoying it and I hope there's more to come.\n\"It's obviously something I didn't really expect, but it's been nice to gel in with the team and be playing and I hope there's many more seasons to come.\n\"We play an expansive game which suits me to get the ball more and more in my hands and with the results we're getting it's working for us.\"\nGiles returned from injury in the 25-23 Pro12 defeat by Munster in February and scored in the bonus-point win over Glasgow the following week.\n\"I'm feeling good and the hamstring's good now and it's just a case of keeping on top of rehab now so I'm raring to go.\n\"It's obviously good to be back up and running and injury free and hopefully I'll get a few consistent games now and get a good run of games.\n\"If it [a Wales call-up] comes it comes, but my main focus is playing well for the Ospreys and seeing the season out,\" Giles added.\nHis Ospreys predecessor Shane Williams is among those to have backed Giles winning international honours early in his career.\n\"I've got the same physical attributes [as Shane Williams] and I was watching him scoring tries for the Ospreys and Wales growing up, so he's definitely a role model of mine.\"", "Ex-President Chen Shui-bian -

Emergency workers had just started trying to collect the dead, and hundreds of bodies lay in neat rows on the roadside.\nIt was in a makeshift camp for survivors in the grounds of a nearby mosque that I first met Mawardah Priyanka. She was 11 years old, exhausted, grimy and alone.\nHer parents had both been killed when the wave - perhaps 35m-tall when it first hit the nearby coastal village of Lampuuk - reached their home.\nIt would be days before she discovered that her big sister, Mutiyah, 16, was still alive.\nIn the months that followed, I kept in contact with the sisters as they moved from the chaotic camp to their own tent, and eventually into a new brick and wood home built for them by the British charity Oxfam.\nMawardah went back to school. Mutiyah soon got married and moved away. Another, much older sister, Ita, came to share the house at Lhoknga.\nAnd then, about eight years ago, I lost touch with them.\nIt's hard to get my bearings as I walk down what used to be a dirt track. Now it's a paved road, with a new bridge over a small stream.\nOn the right, I see a cluster of familiar buildings - concrete bases, with very simple wooden walls and tin roofs.\nSomeone shouts out that a foreigner is coming, and suddenly a tall, beaming figure is rushing out of the door.\nIt's happy, emotional - at times awkward - reunion for both of us. I'm immediately struck by how little Mawardah seems to have changed - height apart - and how much my return evidently means to her, and two days later, to her sister Mutiyah who travels in from the countryside.\nAnd I feel a rush of guilt that I didn't do more to try to stay in touch after various local and foreign contacts - who'd acted as intermediaries in the early days - left the province.\n\"There is nobody to care about me - nobody loves me like my parents,\" says Mawardah tearfully, the following day.\nThe tsunami destroyed all trace of her parents - no photos of her mother or father remain, and Ita now is preoccupied with her young family, leaving Mawardah often alone with her chores, her wooden desk and a simple mattress on a concrete bedroom floor.\nBut it soon becomes clear that the disaster has shaped Mawardah's life in other, more positive ways too.\nAt the age of 21, she is a confident, intelligent and ambitious young woman.\nShe's won several educational scholarships from a local cement factory (now restored after the tsunami), and is studying English at a private college in Banda Aceh.\nOver the next two days, as we talk in her small house, visit her school and lunch with her close circle of friends, I learn more about the trials and complexities of her life, and it strikes me that Marwadah's experiences reflect the broader circumstances of Aceh in the decade since the tsunami.\nFirst there's the house - one of 140,000 built with the staggering $7bn (\u00c2\u00a34.5bn) in international aid given to Aceh.\nMarwadah's was built quickly, and it shows. The roof leaks, its walls are flimsy, and I remember some unpleasant squabbles in the early years about which relatives would ultimately own it.\nBut the building has served its purpose, and the family readily admits it is better than the home they had before 2004.\nElsewhere, it's clear that a significant number of houses are now unoccupied - they were built in a flurry by a badly co-ordinated assortment of often competing aid agencies, flush with money and sometimes more anxious to spend it fast than to address the interests of local communities.\n\"I give the aid effort 65 (out of 100),\" says Muslahuddin Daud, a World Bank official who himself nearly drowned in the tsunami.\n\"A lot of things are not perfect: $7bn - in many ways we could do better. A lot of houses are empty... redundant. We had more than 500 aid organisations and... a lot of overlapping.\nMr Daud said too much foreign money made people feel \"entitled to get aid\" and become lazy.\n\"Aceh has got stuck in terms of growth - the ability to manage the resources is not there,\" he said.\nThen there's peace.\nBefore the tsunami, Aceh was wrestling with a violent separatist rebellion. Even as an 11-year-old, Mawardah remembers the impact it had on everyone's lives - the fear, the road blocks, and the clashes in the hills behind the village.\nBut the disaster acted as an immediate catalyst for peace talks, and today the province continues to benefit from an autonomy deal that ended the conflict.\nThe new government has since introduced elements of Sharia - which many here, including Marwadah, publicly support.\nBut critics say public floggings and other punishments are an abuse of human rights, and that foreign investors are increasingly steering clear of a province that is now falling behind the rest of Indonesia in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction.\n\"We like Sharia. And I am a good Muslim,\" says Marwadah, but she believes the officials who police the new laws are often \"hypocrites\".\nLate one afternoon, we stop at Marwadah's college in Banda Aceh where she's got a Thai kickboxing class with a group of other male and female students.\n\"She's a good student. She works hard, studies hard. As a girl, she has a spirit like a boy. She's strong. She doesn't give up easily,\" says her English teacher Maulizan Za.\nHe worries about inflation, but - like almost everyone else I ask here - believes that life is significantly better and safer than it was before the tsunami.\n\"My friends are my family now,\" says Mawardah, finishing the hour-long kickboxing class and getting ready to drive back home on her sister's motor scooter.\n\"I want to be a strong woman. After I graduate from this college I will next study in America, and get a job like a reporter. I feel my future will be bright,\" she concludes, then bursts into a confident, full-throated laugh.", "Williams, 33, won 2012 European gold, silver in 2010 when he also claimed Commonwealth Games bronze.\nThe London 2012 Olympian had hoped to compete in the Commonwealths on the Gold Coast in April 2018.\nWilliams was ruled out of Glasgow 2014 after failing a doping test and given a four-month ban for inadvertently taking a banned supplement.\nWilliams won Commonwealth bronze in Delhi in 2010 behind Welsh rival Dai Greene but injury put paid to his bid to win another medal in Australia next year.\n\"As a patriotic Welshman, nothing has given me more pride than putting on a Welsh vest and competing for my country,\" said Williams.\n\"Unfortunately, injury has prematurely ended my hopes of competing one last time at the Commonwealth Games next year.\n\"I would like to thank Welsh Athletics and Sport Wales for all their help and support during my athletics career.\n\"I would also like to thank all my support team who have supported me faithfully over the years; my family, coaches, sponsors and all my training partners.\"\nWilliams, son of Welsh and Lions rugby legend JJ, was European champion from every level from Under-18 to senior level where he also won silver and bronze in 2006 and 2010 to go with his 2012 triumph.\nHe competed for Wales at two Commonwealth Games, finishing fourth in Melbourne in 2006 with his bronze in Delhi coming four years later.\nWilliams competed for Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics where he reached the semi-final, the same level he also achieved at the 2005 and 2013 World Championships.\nWelsh Athletics head of coaching and performance Scott Simpson said: \"Rhys' decision to retire from the sport is one that has clearly been given a great deal of thought and one that we have met with the utmost respect and support.\n\"It is never an easy decision to make.

The swing factor between a continuing stable but uninspiring global recovery and relapse into a global downturn is China.\nThe big question is: how steep is China's economic slowdown? Those looking for an answer have pointed to China's surprise decision to devalue its currency in early August.\nDoes this suggest that policy-makers are panicking and trying to boost exports?\nThe fundamental problem that China faces is that its economy is deeply unbalanced - both internally and externally - at a time that it is also slowing.\nEconomists tend to look at an economy for internal balance (a state of affairs in which neither employment nor inflation is too high or too low) and external balance (a situation in which a country's current account (its borrowing or lending to the rest of the world) is neither too high nor too low.\nChina is currently struggling to achieve both kinds of balance.\nChinese policy-makers have a tricky task ahead but not unmanageable one.\nIt's a challenge that could be made much easier by some global policy co-ordination and co-operation.\nAt the heart of China's problem is the  \"impossible trinity\" of international macroeconomics.\nThe impossible trinity - or trilemma - is the idea that it is impossible for a country to have three things at the same time: a stable currency, the free movement of capital (i.e. the absence of capital controls) and independent monetary policy.\nA country can instead choose just two of the options from this policy suite.\nThe UK, in common with most developed economies, has free capital movement and an independent monetary policy - but not a controlled exchange rate.\nThe Bank of England sets interest rates at a level it thinks is right for the UK economy and - as capital can flow into and out of the UK at will - the exchange rate is determined by the market.\nIf, as in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the UK wanted to retain free movement of capital but have a stable exchange rate then it would cease to have an independent monetary policy.\nInstead of being set as appropriate for UK domestic conditions, the interest rate would have to be set to maintain the value of sterling against other currencies - in effect monetary policy would be outsourced.\nChina's policy mix has been to have an independent monetary policy and a controlled exchange rate, which has meant restrictions of the free movement of capital.\nIn reality the situation is a bit more complicated. China's capital controls are porous, money does flow in and out of the country and the renmimbi has been semi-pegged to the dollar, rather than straight-forwardly stable.\nBut things are changing. China is currently pushing for the renmimbi to be formally included in the International Monetary Fund's list of reserve currencies.\nPart of that process involves dismantling its capital controls bit that exposes its own central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), to the trilemma.\nThe slowing domestic economy suggests an easier monetary stance is required and that an easier monetary stance, coupled with freer movement of capital, suggests that a weaker renmimbi lies ahead.\nBut as Karthik Sankaran of Eurasia Group has convincingly argued this wouldn't be ideal either for China or for the global economy.\nDomestically, a weaker currency would tighten financial conditions for any Chinese company that has borrowed in dollars at a time when the PBOC was trying to ease them. But the international spill-overs of a weaker Chinese currency matter more.\nBefore the financial crisis of 2008 China's economy was far from externally balanced - indeed it was a major driver of global imbalance, with a current account surplus of 10% of GDP. That's now down to around 2%, but a weaker currency could force it back up.\nAt a time when disinflationary factors, such as lower commodity prices, are at work and when Western inflation is stuck around 0%, then the last thing the world needs is a Chinese devaluation which would risk turning a still benign period of low inflation into a damaging spell of deflation.\nChina needs easier monetary policy and the world could do without a much weaker renmimbi.\nThankfully that is an achievable mix. But it requires Chinese capital controls to stay in place for longer than intended - giving China the ability to both have an independent monetary policy and a stable exchange rate.\nThe IMF was once regarded as fairly dogmatic on the need for countries to sign up to the free movement of capital.\nBut during the crisis that attitude shifted and the Fund recognised that there are times when capital controls might be appropriate. China right now feels like one of those times. If China can keep its capital controls while moving towards reserve currency status - even for a while - it may be better placed to seek balance.\nIt's very easy to attack China's economic policy missteps of the past few years.\nPropping up an overvalued stock market and surprising the market with currency announcements are just the latest examples.\nBut the bigger criticism is usually over the nature of the post-2009 stimulus package - which kept Chinese growth high by going on a credit and investment binge driven by state owned enterprises, state owned banks and local government.\nThat's left the Chinese economy with a serious mal-investment problem (the often mentioned empty ghost cities) and high level of debt.\nBut, for all the criticism, the counterfactual is rarely stated. What would global growth have looked like without it?\nAt a time when the world was desperately short of economic demand, China stepped up and provided some.\nThat stimulus package helped prop up global growth during the crisis but left China's economy dangerously out of balance.\nHelping China make the transition back towards balance needs to be a central aim for global policymakers.", "Controversial plans to add a further 16 turbines at Scout Moor, on land between Rochdale and Rossendale, were approved earlier this year.\nBut now the government has \"called in\" the decision by Rossendale Borough Council to approve 14 of the turbines.\nIt means a public inquiry will be held before further progress is made.\nScout Moor wind farm opened in 2008 with the 26 existing wind turbines generating enough electricity for 40,000 homes.\nRochdale Borough Council approved plans for the final two turbines to be added.\nOpponents are concerned the expansion of the wind farm will impact negatively on the natural beauty of the area.\nBut energy companies Peel Energy and United Utilities said consultations have shown opposition to the plans is low.\nMW = Megawatts\nSource: RenewableUK", "Together with Charlie Adam's 65-yard strike, Bobby Zamora's lob, Wayne Rooney's volley, Bafetimbi Gomis's acrobatic effort and Alexis Sanchez's thunderbolt, we could almost put together a list of goal of the season contenders in one week.\nBBC Sport takes a look at the goals that were scored, asks which was the best and reports the reaction they all brought.

It's not until the later period of the Middle Iron Age that they become more widespread, so aside from this very exciting discovery of the wheel, we've also got potentially other related aspects that are giving us even more questions.\n\"This site is giving us lots of answers but at the same time it's throwing up questions we never thought we'd have to consider.\"\nAnalysing the data from samples found at Must Farm could take the team several years, he added.\nOther artefacts found inside the roundhouses themselves - including a small wooden box, platter, an intact \"fineware\" pot and clusters of animal and fish bones that could have been kitchen waste - have been described as \"amazing\" by archaeologists.\nThe team is just over halfway through the eight-month dig to uncover the secrets of the site and the people who lived there.", "The US president-elect was being sued by former students who paid $35,000 (\u00c2\u00a328,000) for real estate \"secrets\" from his \"hand-picked\" instructors.\nMr Trump had repeatedly said he would not settle the class-action lawsuits.\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman said the settlement was a \"stunning reversal\" by Mr Trump and a \"major victory\" for victims.\nBut Mr Trump's lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said his client was pleased with the outcome, saying \"he was willing to sacrifice his personal interests, put this behind him, and move forward\".\nThe businessman faced three fraud lawsuits - which alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises - in California and New York.\nA trial in one of the cases had been due to begin in San Diego on 28 November, although Mr Trump's lawyers had attempted to delay the case.\nDonald Trump's ongoing lawsuits\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement: \"Today's $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.\n\"The victims of Trump University have waited years for today's result and I am pleased that their patience - and persistence - will be rewarded by this $25 million settlement.\"\nMr Schneiderman, who Mr Trump has attacked as a \"lightweight\", had sought a $40m payout from Mr Trump over the university, which closed in 2010.\nHe called Trump University a \"fraud from beginning to end\" in July, adding that the organisation used \"false promises to prey on desperate people\".\nUS District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the two California cases, had been urging both sides to settle out of court.\nThe settlement may be costly but it will save the President-elect from a potentially embarrassing trial.\nDonald Trump had vowed to keep fighting this case and his attorneys said they had no doubt he would have won in court, but they added that a resolution allows Mr Trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing the nation.\nSettling though could backfire on Mr Trump as he is facing dozens of lawsuits.\nPlaintiffs may smell blood and think he is eager to settle to avoid court cases while president.\nIn June, Mr Trump said: \"I will win the Trump University case. I already am, as far as I'm concerned.\n\"I could settle that case. I could have settled that case. I just choose not to.\"\nTrump University promised students the opportunity to learn from \"hand-picked\" teachers, that actually were not chosen by Mr Trump himself.\nMr Schneiderman alleged that the closest students ever got to the real estate mogul was having their photo taken beside a cardboard cutout of him. He also said that Mr Trump personally pocketed about $5m (\u00c2\u00a34m) in the \"scheme\".\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump has named more conservative hardliners for key posts, with Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions nominated as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement office.\nMr Sessions was rejected from becoming a federal judge in 1986 because of alleged racist remarks.\nIn a statement, Mr Trump called Mr Sessions a \"world class legal mind\".\nThe people around President-elect Trump\nJeff Sessions dogged by racism claims\nMike Pompeo - America's likely new spymaster\nTrump takes office: Full report\nMike Pompeo will be CIA director and retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn has been made national security adviser.

Thursday.\nThe two are expected to discuss Pakistan's nuclear programme among other issues, including Afghanistan and militant groups such as the Haqqani network and Lashkar-e-Taiba.\nMr Chaudhry's disclosure is seen by many as the first concrete explanation by a Pakistani official of how Pakistan intends to deal with possible Indian aggression.\n\"The fact that Pakistan was making small tactical nuclear weapons was clear to the world from the day Pakistan started its missile programme,\" says Pervez Hoodbhoy, a nuclear physicist and independent security analyst based in Lahore.\n\"It meant that Pakistan had developed low-yield nuclear warheads to be delivered by those missiles at short ranges, in a battlefield, having localised impact, unlike big bombs designed to destroy cities.\"\nExperts believe that the 2011 testing of the nuclear-capable Nasr missile with a 60km range was an indication that Pakistan was building an arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons for use in a theatre of war.\nHasan Askari Rizvi, a Lahore-based expert on defence and security issues, suspects Pakistan may have designed even smaller nuclear weapons, capable of being shot from a specially-designed gun.\n\"The Americans apparently know about these weapons, and recent debate in the US media suggests that Pakistan may actually be in possession of tactical weapons which are greater in number and accuracy than those of India,\" he says.\nMr Hoodbhoy points out that these battlefield weapons could be more dangerous than larger weapons because in the event of a conflict, they will need to be spread out, deployed at multiple locations closer to the targets, and would need to be fired at short notice.\n\"Compliance with nuclear command and control procedures may not always be adequately ensured for all the missile units deployed across a theatre,\" he says.\nAnother matter of concern for Western powers is the fact that Pakistan developed these weapons despite nuclear-related international sanctions in force since 1998, when it carried out its first nuclear test.\nThere is a belief that much of this technology has been acquired from China, a pipeline which will be difficult to block unless Pakistan is brought into the nuclear mainstream.\nThere have been suggestions the US may offer Pakistan membership of the Nuclear Suppliers' Group, with legitimate access to available research and technology, in return for some curbs on fissile material production and its missiles programme.\nIn Pakistan, where the civilian leadership has seemingly been under pressure from the military in matters related to defence and foreign affairs, these suggestions are being touted as a warning that the Americans might try to force Mr Sharif, a civilian, to agree to nuclear curbs.\nMr Chaudhry's statement came against this backdrop, and since he has made no significant disclosures, Prof Askari thinks there may be two reasons why he chose to talk about the issue at all.\n\"One is apparently to reassure domestic audience that there's going to be no 'sell-out' on the nuclear issue,\" he says.\n\"The second may well be to officially confirm to India what it might expect if it ever decides on surgical action or hot pursuit inside Pakistan.\"\nPakistan banned a film released in August called Phantom. It was based on a covert Indian operation to kill the 2008 Mumbai attack plotters, including Hafiz Saeed, the former head of militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is accused of carrying out the attack.\n\"The Americans killed Osama by barging in, why can't we do the same?\" says the agent in charge of the mission, played by Muslim actor Saif Ali Khan.\nIndia said that any nuclear attack on its forces would be treated as a nuclear strike on India itself and it would respond accordingly - so observers warn any use of nuclear weapons could quickly escalate.", "Five men and a woman from Devon each faced charges under the Animal Welfare Act at Newton Abbot Magistrates Court.\nAfter legal argument the charges were dismissed by a district judge as not being animal fighting as defined by the act, said the RSPCA.\nThe charity said it was \"considering its position\" after the decision on 12 November.\nThe RSPCA said in a statement that the judge ruled that \"'taking a dog into the countryside seeking another animal to attack and perhaps kill, in that other animal's own environment and in which that animal is not constrained, artificially or otherwise' did not constitute animal fighting as defined in the act.\n\"The Animal Welfare Act has been one of the most successful ever pieces of legislation in protecting animals from harm and the RSPCA furthers its charitable purposes through enforcing the legislation.\"\nDefence lawyer Simon Rees said on Facebook that the judge was \"100% correct in his interpretation of the law\".\nHe said: \"The decision was that section 8 of the Animal Welfare Act was confined to animal fighting proper and was not, as the RSPCA suggested, any fight between say a lurcher and a fox in the context of a hunt.\n\"The decision upheld the old law under the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which the Animal Welfare Act replaced, to the effect that only captive animals could be the subject of fighting.\"", "People in Merseyside are paying the most in England for their electricity and Londoners the most for gas, the new figures suggest.\nAverage annual household bills in Merseyside are \u00a31,346 for electricity and gas.\nThat compared with \u00a31,261 in the East of England.\nA DECC spokeswoman said areas such as Merseyside were paying more because of the costs of distribution and transmission from one region to another.\nLondon paid the most in the UK for gas, at \u00a3743 per household per year. The East Midlands pays the least for gas, \u00a3699 on average per household.\nThe data reveals households in the Scilly Isles used an average of 7,933 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity in 2014, compared with 3,176 kWh in the London borough of Islington.\nThe figures showed electricity use in England was slightly down on the year before.\nThe national average in 2013 was 4,099 kWh per household while in 2014 it fell to 4,048.\nOn bills, the figures showed the East Midlands paid the least for electricity in the UK on credit, at \u00a3593 over a year.\nIn statements accompanying the figures, the DECC said electricity and gas bills had fallen \u00a345 on average, \u00a38 for electricity and \u00a337 for gas.\nA DECC spokeswoman said: \"Keeping bills down for hardworking families is a priority and we are taking action to support bill payers.\n\"Energy bills fell by \u00a345 this year and we will continue to work hard to reduce them further. Thanks to Government reforms there are now 31 energy suppliers in the market helping to drive more competition and choice for bill payers to shop around for a cheaper deal.

Now, it is expected to be occupied by his successor, Nana Akufo-Addo, who won elections last month.\nThe question is: Where should the new vice-president live? As far as Mr Mahama is concerned it is not in the house he is occupying. The new government seems to disagree. Will it send the removal trucks? Watch this space.\nThe former president's office has dismissed the reports as \"mischievous\" and insisted that the last parliament had also resolved that a home and an office should be be given to Mr Mahama \"in line with convention and existing precedent\".\nMr Mahama's office said Mr Bawumia was instead expected to live in another building, Australia House, a government safe house previously occupied by former Vice-President Kwesi Bekoe Amissah-Arthur.\nMr Mahama was widely credited for accepting defeat in elections last month, rather than challenging the result.\nHe is among regional mediators trying to persuade The Gambia's long-serving ruler Yahya Jammeh to step down after he lost elections to property develop Adama Barrow.", "Ross Forbes opened the scoring when his cross-cum-shot from the right bounced untouched into the Rovers net.\nAberdeen loanee Lawrence Shankland doubled the lead after half-time, heading home Mark Russell's cross.\nThe win moves Jim Duffy's men within five points of Dundee United - who sit second - with a game in hand.\nRaith Rovers were the last side to beat Morton in Greenock in March last year, but there was never any danger of that result being repeated on this occasion.\nIt was a game of few real chances in the first half and while the visitors did most of the pressing, it was the home side who took the lead on 27 minutes with a somewhat fortunate seventh goal of the season for Forbes.\nAlways dangerous cutting in from the right with his left foot, the winger's cross-cum-shot missed its intended target of Shankland, deceived Raith goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert and nestled in the corner of the net.\nBobby Barr had the visitors best chance of the half, but his angled shot was well saved by Morton keeper Derek Gaston right on the interval.\nRaith started the second half on the front foot and Morton's Russell had to clear off the line before keeper Gaston produced two decent saves to stop good efforts from Ross Callachan and Ryan Hardie.\nBut it was the home side who stretched their lead on 67 minutes when Russell's deep cross from the left was met by Shankland to head a debut goal for Duffy's side following his move from St Mirren earlier in the week.\nMorton manager Jim Duffy: \"We played well today; it was a tough match as they all are in this division.

I'm only going to think about what we can do.\"\nAnd what could Ben do for his son?\nAs a further education psychology lecturer by profession, Sol's father was absolutely convinced that early intervention was vital for his son to adapt to life without his arm and hand.\nBut he soon learnt health professionals would not offer help with prosthetic false arms until Sol was a year old - and even then, the artificial arms would be purely cosmetic with no grabbing or holding action.\nSol's dad did not want to wait a year.\n\"I just thought that wasn't good enough,\" stated Ben.\nFirst, he used rolled-up pieces of foam taped to Sol's elbow to see what would happen.\nWithin minutes, Sol was banging his toys with his hand - and his foam arm. It was the first time he had tried to use the left arm since the amputation.\n\"Before that, the left arm didn't do anything.\"\nIt was the breakthrough moment for Ben. From there, developing a better prosthetic arm for young Sol became an obsession.\nWorking on the kitchen table with bits of copper pipe and plumbing fittings, Ben came up with an idea for a new design that would operate a hand using tiny movements of the elbow.\nConvinced it would work, he walked into a newly opened innovation laboratory at Bangor University and asked them for help.\n\"When I started to talk to Ben and found out what he wanted to do and why he wanted to come here, I was quite humbled really,\" remembered Wyn Griffith, chief technician for Pontio Innovation.\n\"We'd just moved into this building - what better way to put this new equipment to use than to actually help Ben with his project.\"\nUsing state-of-the-art 3D printing technology at the innovation lab, Ben and the university staff were able to turn a mish-mash of DIY store parts and imagination into something much more.\n\"The best way we can help people, is to help them help themselves - and I think Ben is a good case in point there. We've given Ben the skills and access to the equipment and training so he can actually develop his own ideas,\" said the university engineer.\nToday, Sol has a new prototype of an arm and hand that can grip, with a moveable thumb.\nAnd instead of the three months it takes to cast and build a fibreglass prosthetic through the health service, a new arm can be built and printed from scratch in a matter of days.\nIt means not only is the young boy getting the early intervention his family are convinced he needs, it has opened up a whole new world of opportunities for his father.\nBen has given up his day job to concentrate full-time on prosthetics, setting up a new company called Ambionics, with Sol firmly the poster boy for the new venture.\nDespite being a fledgling start-up, Ben has already won some big name backing. Along with Bangor University's Pontio centre, Ambionics is also being supported by the Life Sciences Hub Wales and its entrepreneurship programme.\nHe has also won praise from the firm Stratasys, who developed the 3D printers he has been using.\n\"Ben Ryan's approach to problem solving with 3D printing as a facilitator and the terrific results enjoyed by doing so are indicative of what can be achieved when harnessing this technology,\" said the firm's head of healthcare solutions, Scott Rader.\nSo far, the whole project has been funded by family and friends, but will be the focus of a crowd funding campaign on St David's Day on Wednesday, 1 March.\nBen wants to raise at least \u00c2\u00a3150,000 to satisfy medical authorities his arm prosthetics are safe to use, finalise patents, and to develop the design.\nIf he can raise even more, he wants to see medical research trials to back up his own theories on how young children learn to use artificial limbs.\nBut as the business moves forward, the focus always returns to Sol - the Ambionic Boy as his dad now calls him.\n\"He can do 90% of the things a kid with two hands can do, I just want to help him adjust to those 10% of tasks he is going to find difficult,\" said Ben.\n\"The point I will relax is when I see him reach for something. I want him to turn around and just be able to pick something up just naturally, and then I'll know that I've done a good job.\"", "All birds at the farm in Goosnargh, Preston, are due to be culled and animal movements have been restricted within a 10km \"control zone\".\nDefra said the decision to cull was \"based on the clinical symptoms and emerging laboratory findings\".\nThe risk to public health was very low, a spokesman added.\n\"We have a strong track record of controlling and eliminating previous outbreaks of avian flu in the UK,\" he said.\n\"The outbreaks in Yorkshire last year and Hampshire in February were both successfully contained, allowing restrictions to be lifted at the earliest opportunity.\"\nDefra's chief vet Nigel Gibbens added: \"We have taken swift precautionary action to limit the risk of the disease spreading.

Phil Neville joins Danny Murphy and Gary Lineker in the studio.\nThey are on a bad run, obviously, but I don't think it is Pardew's fault. I actually feel sorry for him, because Palace's players are letting him down big-time at the moment.\nSometimes you can see a manager has picked the wrong team, is using the wrong tactics or has signed the wrong players.\nBut those are not the reasons why Crystal Palace lost at Swansea, or why they are struggling right now.\nThey are in this situation because their players' application when they are defending set-pieces is nothing short of a disgrace.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFour of the five goals that Swansea scored on Saturday were from set-pieces, and Palace have now conceded 13 goals from free-kicks or corners in 13 Premier League games this season - five more than any other team.\nYou might see those statistics as being down to the manager but, against Swansea, Pardew set his players up in the perfect position to defend them, and they let him down.\nIt keeps happening, and it keeps costing Palace points - look at last week's game against Manchester City when they switched off and Yaya Toure scored a late winner for City from a corner.\nYou cannot blame Pardew for that. As a manager, you cannot defend them yourself - successfully stopping teams at set-pieces is down to the players.\nFor me, it is about having the courage to win the ball and put your head in, sometimes where it hurts, and if your job is to pick someone up then you have to be focused on doing it.\nLike I say, a manager can affect none of those things during a game. All Pardew can do with Palace is set them up in the right positions. He is doing that, but he cannot make them defend.\nAt the moment I think Palace's players lack courage, determination and concentration at set-pieces, and they are paying the price for it.\nLast season under Pardew, Palace had the joint-best record at defending set-pieces in the top-flight.\nAlong with Tottenham they conceded only seven times from them in 38 games, and they are not something his sides are previously known to struggle with.\nThey obviously practice defending free-kicks and corners in training and they will also have had some of Swansea's set-pieces up on their wall of the dressing room.\nSo I am sure they were as well-prepared as possible ahead of Saturday's game, but they kept on conceding goals that way.\nIf you are playing Palace and you get a free-kick in their half, you will now be thinking that there is a 60-70% chance we are going to score.\nUnlike some of the other teams at the wrong end of the table, scoring goals is not a problem for Pardew's side - they have got players who can score and the system they play, using the flanks and putting in lots of crosses, gets the best out of them.\nThey don't lack quality, or spirit either. They are not what I would call a 'dead' team - in fact they are very dangerous when they attack.\nIt is purely and simply defensive set-pieces where they have problems. That is why they have fallen to near the bottom of the league.\nI don't think Palace's latest defeat will cost Pardew his job.\nPardew is lucky because he is at a pretty unique club where the chairman Steve Parish is sensible - he understands football, can see what is happening and knows he has got a good manager.\nIt is rare these days to see a calm chairman, not somebody who will lose his head and think it is sacking season.\nBut Pardew is obviously highly thought of at Palace and is at a club where he will get time.\nThat situation will not last forever if his side keep losing, though, and the next two games are crucial for Pardew because Palace have got some very tough fixtures after that.\nHis team have to start winning soon but they are definitely capable of turning this bad run around. I think they are too good to be where they are in the table.\nPardew must stay positive too. He was clearly very disappointed straight after the Swansea game but sometimes as a manager you cannot do anything about a defeat.\nHe just has to accept what went wrong, keep working hard and hope that, when it comes to stopping set-pieces, the penny will eventually drop for his players.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPhil Neville was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "They say it is inappropriate the show is taking place as part of F\u00e9ile an Phobail because of controversial jokes Mr Boyle has made in the past about disabled people.\nLast month, festival organisers said they were \"deeply sorry for any hurt or offence\" that had been caused by Mr Boyle's appearance.\nThey said they would put in place measures to avoid such a situation \"arising in the future\".\nOpponents had demanded the show's cancellation because of jokes Boyle has told about people with Down's syndrome.\nMr Boyle made his remarks during a live show in 2010.\nThe mother of a girl with the condition said he had \"made fun of the way people with Down's syndrome speak\" and \"made a number of references to people with Down's syndrome dying early\".\nFestival organisers met those who were opposed to the comedian's performance but said the gig would go-ahead.\nF\u00e9ile management also gave a pledge to represent the concerns of the group to Boyle's management.\nF\u00e9ile an Phobail said the show had been the fastest-selling comedy gig it has ever put on.\nLocal comedian Shane Todd has a sister who has autism and spina bifida.\n\"I think he's a very, very good comedian,\" he said.\n\"He certainly does talk about a lot of taboo subjects, granted, but I think he's a very intelligent guy and often he puts quite a different slant on things.\n\"They're not as bad as they sound when they're written down in black and white, but I can understand being a community festival why some people are offended by it and don't want it to go ahead, but in terms of his brand of humour, I'm a fan of Frankie Boyle.\"\nMr Todd said nothing was off limits as a comedian if you could come at it from an intelligent angle and put a different slant on it and not just poke fun.\n\"Are some of his jokes offensive? Yes, probably, but I think ultimately that's what people want whenever they go to see Frankie Boyle.\n\"I probably wouldn't do that sort of material but you set the line where ever you want to when ever you're a performer and if you're comfortable with that and if people enjoy it then you do it, I suppose.\n\"Quite a lot of the time, now not every time, he's not actually making fun of this sort of taboo subject itself, he's more making fun of the interpretation of it or other people's reaction to it.\n\"I wouldn't be totally offended, but I can understand how people would be.\"", "Our part of the country has long been a two-party affair to a greater extent than anywhere else in the country, so a straightforward device pointing this way and then that was almost invariably quite good enough to do the job.\nBut what, I ask myself, would we need to visualise the infinite variety of 2015?\nThe best idea I have managed to come up with so far goes like this.\nImagine you suspend a needle from a thread above a table on which you position magnets of varying strengths and political colours in a circle.\nThey symbolise the interactions between the parties in each constituency.\nLower the needle towards the centre of the table and see which way it points. [Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!]\nBut the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another.\nIn this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself.\nTake for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull.\nIn the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649.\nIn 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck.\nSolihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues.\nExtreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another.\nLike a collection of by-elections perhaps?\nThat may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions.\nAnd what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens?\nOr, about those \"percentage swing to win or lose\" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment?\nAll it tells us is how little they tell us.\n\"Never assume\" said the recently-departed doyen of cricket commentators Richie Benaud.\nIn an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect. Maybe the answer lies not in the macro but in the micro.\nIn this contest so full of unexpected twists and turns, how surprising would it really be if the result itself were to spring the biggest surprise of all?", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nA goal from police officer Lee Casciaro in Tuesday's Champions League qualifier condemned Celtic to arguably their worst ever defeat.\nThe Imps also included a fireman, a customs officer and a taxi driver.\n\"I'm not really [shocked].

Loch Lomond Seaplanes still uses the strip for scheduled flights.\nFeedback on the summary is now to be sought from Transport Scotland.\nHighland Council, public transport body Hitrans and Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) have been investigating the potential for more flights for Skye.\nThe organisations believe the project would bring socio-economic benefits to the island and the wider Highland area.\nThey have calculated that over 30 years the flights could generate in the region of \u00c2\u00a336m to \u00c2\u00a346m, depending on whether nine-seat or 19-seat aircraft were used.\nThe strip near Broadford was built in the 1970s by Army engineers, and appears briefly in a scene from the 1980 film Flash Gordon, which starred Sam J Jones, Max von Sydow, Timothy Dalton and Brian Blessed.\nThe strip remains available to the emergency services and scheduled commercial flights.\nIan Blackford, SNP MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber and a long-time campaigner for more flights, had earlier urged Highland Council's Isle of Skye and Raasay committee to approve the executive summary.\nAfter the committee's meeting, its chairman Drew Millar said: \"This is a very exciting report.\n\"The reintroduction of scheduled flights to Skye would be an enormous boost to our local economy and the cost benefit analysis clearly proves how valuable this would be.\n\"I would like to thank council officers and partners in Hitrans and HIE for preparing this business case and moving things considerably forward.\"\nLeader of the council, Margaret Davidson, added: \"The importance of regional airports, including Skye, was raised just last week by councillor Allan Henderson at the meeting of the Islands Transport Forum, which I understand was a very positive meeting.\n\"Good transport links, including regional air connectivity, are vital to the economic success of communities in the Highlands and Islands.\n\"People want to come and visit our beautiful region and we want to make it as easy as possible for them to access all that we have to offer.\"", "Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Scotland it would be \"anti-democratic\" for the UK government to block a referendum.\nAnd she said she would consider her options if the will of the Scottish Parliament \"is not respected\".\nMrs May said the focus should be on securing the best possible Brexit deal.\nShe added that it would not be fair for the people of Scotland to be asked to make a decision on independence before the terms of Brexit were clear.\nSpeaking shortly after the prime minister, Scottish Secretary David Mundell clarified that the UK government \"will not be entering into discussions or negotiations\" about referendum, and that \"any request at this time will be declined\".\nMs Sturgeon wants a referendum to be held in the autumn of next year or the spring of 2019, to coincide with the expected conclusion of the UK's negotiations with the EU.\nIn an interview with BBC Scotland's Jackie Bird, she said she had an \"unequivocal mandate\" to hold a referendum, and that a majority of MSPs at Holyrood were likely to back her call in a vote next Wednesday.\nMs Sturgeon added: \"You are asking me to accept that a Conservative prime minister who has one MP in Scotland has the right to lay down the law to Scotland's democratically elected parliament. That is unacceptable\".\nShe went on to say that she would \"consider my options and what I should do\" if a formal Scottish Parliament request to hold a referendum is turned down.\nMs Sturgeon added: \"I am determined that I will have one on my timescale, because the will of the Scottish Parliament will be respected.\n\"I accept that the prime minister has said what she has said today. What I don't accept is that that position is an acceptable one, a democratic one or a sustainable one.\"\nThe first minister said Mrs May appeared to be suggesting that a vote on independence could not be held until \"long, long after\" the UK had left the EU.\nShe said this would mean that the \"damage of Brexit will have started to be done\" and it would be \"too late for Scotland, without suffering that damage, to choose a different path\".\n2017\nBrexit will be triggered in March\n2018/19 Sturgeon's preferred vote dates\n2019 Two year Brexit deal period ends\n2020 Next UK general election\n2021 Next Holyrood election\nMs Sturgeon claimed that the UK government had \"sunk the Brexit ship\" and was now seeking to \"puncture Scotland's lifeboat\", and that it was like \"going back to the bad old days of Margaret Thatcher\".\nBut referring to the UK government's u-turn over national insurance contributions on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon said that the prime minister was \"not the Iron Lady\" and had shown she was capable of changing her mind in the face of public opinion.\nMrs May had earlier said that her message to Ms Sturgeon on a referendum was clear - \"now is not the time\".\nThe prime minister added: \"I think we should be working to get the right deal for Scotland and the UK with our future partnership with the European Union.\n\"It would be unfair to the people of Scotland that they would be being asked to make a crucial decision without the information they need to make that decision.\"\nThe prime minister also said the country should be \"working together, not pulling apart\".", "That's the position Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Enda Kenny found himself in on Wednesday.\nMr Kenny and two of his cabinet ministers were trapped between floors at a food plant in County Kildare.\nA technician was called and the taoiseach and his colleagues were freed after a few minutes.\nIt put a downer on an event to mark the official opening of the new food technology centre.\nBut, looking at the upside, cabinet minister Jimmy Deenihan was heard to quip that the lift was \"a good meeting room\".\nIt is not the first time a top Irish politician has had their buttons pushed by temperamental transport.\nIn 2013, the then health minister, James Reilly and his colleague Kathleen Lynch were trapped in a lift for 15 minutes while touring a new health centre.", "\"Russia, and the regime, owe the world more than an explanation about why they keep hitting hospitals and medical facilities and children,\" he said.\n\"These are acts that beg for an appropriate investigation of war crimes.\"\nMoscow has repeatedly denied attacking civilians, and said it targets terrorist groups in Syria.\nMr Kerry, however, said Russian and Syrian government attacks on hospitals were \"beyond the accidental\" and part of a deliberate strategy in war-torn Syria.\n\"This is a targeted strategy to terrorise civilians and to kill anybody and everybody who is in the way of their military objectives,\" he said.\nMr Kerry was speaking in Washington at a news conference with the French Foreign Minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault.\nMr Ayrault is in Washington before a meeting of the UN Security Council, where he will present a plan for a further ceasefire to try to get humanitarian access to the divided city of Aleppo.\nBut Russia's deputy foreign minister, Gennady Gatilov, said France's draft was unacceptable on a number of points and politicised humanitarian aid.\nUS and Russian talks on the crisis have cooled after the breakdown in a ceasefire brokered in September. Both sides blame each other for the collapse.\nThe UN's Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, Stephen O'Brien, recently said medical facilities in east Aleppo were being destroyed \"one-by-one\".\nPatients are being turned away, no medicines are available to treat even the most common ailments, and the number of people requiring urgent medical evacuations is likely to rise dramatically with clean water and food in very short supply.\nThe Syrian American Medical Society said the area's largest hospital had been forced to close in the early days of October following a barrel bomb attack.\nThe group blamed Russian and Syrian forces for three separate attacks on the hospital within a week. Several staff were reported dead.\n\"The hospital is now not usable at all,\" said Adham Sahloul from the group, which supports the M10 hospital.\n\"It is not salvageable,\" he told the AFP news agency.\nEarlier on Friday, Russia's parliament voted to approve an \"indefinite\" deployment of forces in Syria at the Hmeimim airbase.\nThe facility had been supporting Russian troops since August 2015 on a temporary basis, but Friday's vote could lead to a permanent base.\nRussia has also been openly criticised by German leader Angela Merkel, who said it should use its influence in Syria to \"end these heinous crimes\".\nMr Kerry's remarks come hours after Russia said it was ready to back a new UN plan to end violence in Aleppo.\nStaffan de Mistura, the UN's special envoy for the Syrian crisis, appealed for fighters from the rebel group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham - formerly known as the Nusra Front - to be able to leave Aleppo with their weapons.\nEastern Aleppo, held by rebel forces, has been subjected to a constant campaign of air strikes by Syrian and Russian forces in recent weeks. About 275,000 people still live in the eastern part of the city.\nHe said he was prepared to personally accompany the jihadists out of the city if it would stop the fighting.\nRussia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, backed the plan \"for the sake of saving Aleppo.\"\nThe jihadist faction, however, has already rejected the proposal as a \"surrender\".\nRussia and Syria say their forces are attacking Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Western powers dispute this, pointing to the high proportion of civilians being killed.\nMr de Mistura said only about 900 of the estimated 8,000 fighters in eastern Aleppo were members of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.", "President Francois Hollande's ruling Socialists lost ground overall, as turnout slumped to a record low of 61%.\nThe FN won a clear majority in Henin-Beaumont, a northern former coal-mining town. It did well in the south too.\nPM Jean-Marc Ayrault has urged voters to back any candidate best placed to beat the FN in the second round.\nThe Socialists have now announced that they will join forces with the Greens and the Communist Party in an effort to block FN advances in the second round, AFP news agency reports. It will mean the three parties fielding combined electoral lists.\nThe FN, an anti-EU party demanding tough curbs on immigration, took the lead in Avignon, Perpignan, Beziers and Frejus in the south. It was also in second place in Marseille.\nResults are still being counted and the second round of voting will take place next weekend.\nNationwide the opposition centre-right UMP and allies took 47%, the Socialist Party and its allies took 38% and the FN was on 5%.\nBy Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris\nThe FN's successes in the municipal election are more proof of its entrenchment in French politics.\nCertainly its score needs to be kept in perspective.  After next Sunday's second round the FN will probably only control a handful of towns.\nBut still.  Once again the party has shaken the establishment with its capacity to represent discontent.\nThe FN will take part in more than 100 \"triangular\" votes next Sunday.  These are in towns where three parties (normally the Socialists, the UMP and the FN) qualified from round one.\nPerversely these situations benefit the Socialists, because the right-wing vote is split.  Some towns may thus be saved for the left.\nIn Paris two women are in contest to be the new mayor. The rightwinger Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet has a narrow lead over the Socialist Anne Hidalgo,  but victory is far from assured.  This is because of the peculiar system in Paris,  where the mayor is chosen not directly by voters,  but by an electoral caucus of councillors from the 20 districts.\nThere was some consolation for the Socialists in Paris, where their candidate for mayor, Anne Hidalgo, may still beat her conservative rival Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet. That contest looks set to be very tight.\nThe FN vote was proportionately high, as its candidates ran in just 600 out of some 36,000 constituencies, Reuters news agency reports.\nThe BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the FN will have little chance of gaining control of town halls in the second round. But he says it is a big advance for them and an expression of growing exasperation with the traditional parties of right and left.\nThe FN is widely expected to do well in the European Parliament elections in late May - and opinion polls suggest the Eurosceptic party is on course to come top.\nIt was the first major electoral test for President Hollande, who is deeply unpopular after nearly two years in power.\nThe ballot is to choose councillors and mayors in more than 36,000 villages, towns and cities.\nThe FN took 50.26% of the vote in Henin-Beaumont, which has historically voted for the left.\nIn some 200 places FN candidates have won through to the second round.\nMarine Le Pen, FN leader since 2011, hailed the results, saying her party had \"arrived as a major independent force - a political force at both national and local level\".\nMany people who voted for President Hollande two years ago chose to abstain, which has meant losses for the Socialists, our correspondent notes, and in many important towns they will struggle in the second round to hold off challenges from the UMP.", "Amidst the outpouring of grief, one image was repeated again and again: little girls, their hair in two perfect \"cinnamon buns\", smiling for the camera.\nFisher was, of course, much more than the role she won aged 19, yet Princess Leia - and an iconic hairstyle - have come to symbolise the actress, author and script doctor.\nFisher took it in her stride, telling Time Out in 2014: \"I am Leia and Leia is me. We've overlapped each other because my life has been so cartoony or superhero-like. By this age, it would be ridiculous if I had a problem with it.\"\nBut what is it about that particular hairstyle - which only appeared in the first film - which has sparked so many imaginations over the years? And where did it come from?\nAccording to Brandon Alinger, the author of Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy, the buns do not even appear in any of the concept artwork done for Leia in the preparation of the film.\nIn later interviews, Star Wars creator George Lucas said he looked to Mexico's female revolutionaries, or \"soldaderas\", who joined the uprising at the start of the 20th Century.\n\"I went with a kind of south-western Pancho Villa woman revolutionary look, which is what that is. The buns are basically from turn-of-the-century Mexico,\" Lucas told Time in 2002.\nIt makes sense to look to such a band of women when creating a character far removed from a traditional princess awaiting rescue.\n\"George didn't want a damsel in distress, didn't want your stereotypical princess - he wanted a fighter, he wanted someone who was independent,\" Fisher explained to the BBC in 1977.\nThere is only one problem with Lucas's claim. Female Mexican revolutionaries are not known for their hairstyles - or certainly not hairstyles of that sort.\n\"As much as I would like to say that Princess Leia's hairstyle was based on the 'soldaderas' from the Mexican Revolution, this was probably not the case,\" Tabea Linhard, author of Fearless women in the Mexican Revolution and the Spanish Civil War, told the BBC.\n\"If you take a look at photos from the period, you see women with long braids, some wear hats, on occasion they cover their hair with a shawl.\n\"Conditions on the battlefields were harsh, and the women's task included carrying supplies, taking care of all the men's needs, serving as spies or smugglers; some also participated in battle.\n\"So a hairstyle like Leia's probably was not a convenient option.\"\nHowever, the hairstyle does appear to have roots in North American history.\nKendra Van Cleave of Frock Flicks, a website which reviews the accuracy of costumes in historical dramas, told the BBC that while such buns had been fashionable in medieval Europe, the \"most obvious\" inspiration is the \"squash blossom\" style worn by women of the Hopi tribe in Arizona.\nShe said: \"This consists of two side arrangements which aren't actually buns - they're more loops of hair.\n\"The hair is parted in the centre, then wrapped around a U-shaped 'hair bow' made of wood. The hair is wrapped in a figure of eight pattern, then tied at the middle and spread out to create the two semi-circles.\n\"This hairstyle became more widely known in the early 20th century due to photography,\" says Ms Van Cleave, who adds it saw a revival in the 1920s.\n\"Of course, the 1920s was an era when women in the Western hemisphere were shaking up traditional gender roles - American women got the vote in 1920, and were attending college and taking on professional employment in unprecedented numbers.\n\"Many of the arty, bohemian women of the 1920s adopted 'ethnic' fashion as a means of demonstrating their difference from the mainstream and therefore as a feminist statement.\"", "In the first two decades of his rule Libya became the world's pariah, as the flamboyant colonel used his country's oil wealth to support groups such as the Irish Republican Army and the Palestine Liberation Organisation.\nWestern enmity towards Libya reached a peak in 1988 when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Scotland killing 270 people.  It would be 15 years before Libya admitted responsibility.\nEventually it was his own people, helped by Western military effort who rose up and finally removed him from power.\nMuammar Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi was born into a Bedouin family on 7 June 1942, near the Libyan city of Sirte.\nAs a teenager, he became an admirer of the Egyptian leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser, whose brand of Arab Nationalism struck a chord with the young Gaddafi.\nHe first hatched plans to topple the monarchy of King Idris, while at military college, and received further army training in Britain.\nAs Captain Gaddafi, he returned to the Libyan city of Benghazi and, on 1 Sep 1969, launched a bloodless coup while the king was receiving medical treatment in Turkey.\nGaddafi became chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council which was set up to run the country - one of his first acts was to expel his country's Italian population.\nLike Nasser, he did not promote himself to the rank of General, as is the custom of most military dictators, but remained a Colonel throughout his rule. This fitted in with his idea of Libya being \"ruled by the people\".\nHe laid out his political philosophy in the 1970s in his Green Book, which charted a home-grown alternative to both socialism and capitalism, combined with aspects of Islam.\nHis rule blended Arab nationalism with a socialist welfare state and popular democracy, although the democracy did not allow for any challenge to his own position as leader.\nWhile small business were allowed to remain in private hands, the state ran the big organisations, including the oil industry.\nNo-one doubted that he exercised total control, and was ruthless in dealing with anyone who stepped out of line and opposed him.\nGaddafi believed in a union of Arab states and set out to extend Libya's influence throughout the region.\nHe began by trying to merge Libya with Egypt and Syria but disagreement over the conditions rendered it impossible. A similar arrangement with Tunisia also floundered.\nThe Muammar Gaddafi story\nThe Gaddafi family tree\nGaddafi's strong support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation also harmed his relations with Egypt which had reached a peace deal with Israel.\nHe sent Libyan forces into the neighbouring country of Chad in 1973 in order to occupy the disputed Aouzou Strip. Eventually this led to a full-scale Libyan invasion and a war that only ended in 1987.\nIn 1977 he invented a system called the \"Jamahiriya\" or \"state of the masses\", in which power is meant to be held by thousands of \"peoples' committees\".\nHis committees called for the assassination of Libyan dissidents living abroad and, during the 1980s, sent hit squads to murder them.\nGaddafi's regime was accused of serious human rights abuses\nLibya had a law forbidding group activity based on a political ideology opposed to Gaddafi's revolution.\nCampaign group Human Rights Watch claimed the regime has imprisoned hundreds of people  and sentenced some to death. Torture and disappearances have also been reported.\nBy the early 1980s Gaddafi's support for a diverse collection of revolutionary groups brought him into conflict with the West\nThe UK broke off relations with Libya in 1984, after the killing of Police Constable Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan Embassy in London.\nTwo years later, the United States bombed Tripoli and Benghazi as a reprisal for alleged Libyan involvement in the bombing of a Berlin nightclub used by American military personnel.\nLibya was reportedly a major financier of the \"Black September\" Palestinian group that was responsible, among others, for the kidnap and killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, as well as becoming a supplier of weapons to the IRA.\nThe Lockerbie bombing eventually triggered a change in the relationship between Gaddafi's regime and the west, although it was 11 years before Gaddafi agreed to hand over the two Libyan nationals who had been indicted for the crime.\nAnxious for foreign investment as the price of oil fell, Gaddafi renounced terrorism. A compensation deal for the families of the Lockerbie victims was agreed and UN sanctions on Libya were lifted.\nMonths later, Gaddafi's regime abandoned efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction, triggering a fuller rapprochement with the West.\nAmerican sanctions were also lifted and Libya was reported to be helping western intelligence services in their fight against al-Qaeda\nIn a climate of rapprochement, then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair went to Libya to meet Gaddafi in a Bedouin tent on the outskirts of Tripoli in 2004.\nHowever, some in the West questioned this new relationship. And in parts of the Arab world, Gaddafi was criticised for cosying up to his old adversaries.\nGaddafi's eccentricity was legendary: He had a bodyguard of woman soldiers, and an almost narcissistic interest in his wardrobe. On one occasion reporters called to a news conference found him ploughing a field.\nA tent was also used to receive visitors in Libya, where Gaddafi sat through meetings or interviews swishing the air with a horsehair or palm leaf fly-swatter.\nThere was also growing unrest among ordinary Libyans who claimed reforms were slow in coming and said they were not benefiting from Libya's wealth. Many public services remained poor and corruption was rife.\nThat unrest boiled over in 2011 when, spurred on by the toppling of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, and Tunisia's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, demonstrators took to the streets demanding the end of the Gaddafi regime.\nSecurity forces, including African mercenaries hired by Gaddafi, clashed with anti-government protesters with reports the Libyan air force jets had bombed opposition areas. Hundreds of people were reported to have been killed.\nThis prompted the UN Security Council to authorise the use of force and Nato countries immediately started bombing loyalist positions.\nGradually, with Nato help, the rag-tag opposition forces advanced across the country, seized the capital, Tripoli, in August and set up a transitional government.\nGaddafi remained at large until 20 October, when he was finally located and killed in his home town of Sirte.\nAfter all his bluster and bravado the longest serving leader in both Africa and the Arab world met an ignominious end.", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nIan Parkhill scored the opener on the half hour, pouncing after home keeper Stefan McCusker had fumbled Jamie McGonigle's shot.\nUnited levelled on 57 minutes through Adam Leckey's glancing header.\nBut a fine 84th-minute strike by Rodney Brown gave Coleraine their first ever Premiership win at Ferney Park.\nIt meant a fourth successive league defeat for Ballinamallard who are ninth in the table.\nFront man Parkhill had started the match because leading scorer James McLaughlin was injured in the warm-up.\nHe snapped up the opening goal after McCusker failed to hold on to McGonigle's low shot.\nBallinamallard should have scored before the break but James McCartney shot wide from just a few yards out.\nHowever, the hosts did equalise as big midfielder Leckey headed in from a Jason McCartney corner.\nColeraine secured the victory when Brown got his fifth goal of the season with a superbly-struck shot.\nColeraine manager Oran Kearney: \"We never get it easy here and it is great to come away with the three points for the first time.\n\"It was disappointing to concede from the corner because we aim to limit teams at set pieces.\n\"But our players found some energy and strength of character from somewhere and found another gear.\n\"We had other chances before Rodney scored with what was a great strike.\"", "Or should they be breaking down complex political subjects and putting them in simpler terms to get more potential voters interested?\nThese were some of the ideas being bandied around at an event in Portcullis House in Westminster to mark the end of Parliament Week.\nThe event host, UK Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Louise Court, told the audience of young women that while the 2010 general election was seen as the \"Mumsnet\" election, this time round, they want it to be \"millennial\" voters - people currently aged between 18 and 32 - calling the shots.\nBut while these women feel \"really strongly about issues\", they can't find politicians who are speaking for them, Ms Court said.\nMany want to vote but are not registered to do so. Apparently only 44% of 18-24 year-olds voted in the 2010 election.\nOne rather alarming poll she had seen suggested that could drop to just 12% next year - although some doubts were voiced about that one.\nA straw poll of the room showed that wasn't the case here: most hands shot up when asked who was registered. But then, events like this attract those young adults who are already a bit political.\nAmong those present was 26-year-old singer-songwriter Eliza Doolittle, who has become involved with the Bite the Ballot campaign to get more young people registered to vote.\nShe is a newcomer to politics and told the audience that while she didn't \"know every single politician\", she felt she could not relate to those she saw every day, and was considering spoiling her ballot if none of the options appealed.\nBinita Mehta, a 24-year-old Watford councillor, said young women could make a difference on local issues but added: \"Maybe we have got to do a bit of wiki-research to learn what politics is about.\"\nShe urged Ms Doolittle not to spoil her ballot. \"I'm going to inform myself to the point where I hope I don't have to,\" the singer replied.\nRadio One DJ Gemma Cairney, 29, said that for many of her generation, politics was a \"complete other world\", which many could not even get up the energy to feel let down by.\nMany were in debt - which created a whole new reason not to register to vote. \"They are afraid to register because that means the bailiffs know where they live,\" she said.\nBut what can politicians do to appeal to \"millennial\" voters?\nPerhaps more party political videos on YouTube? Or at least the \"real\" version of Newsnight interviews - with subtitles breaking down what politicians are really saying.\nPerhaps more of a focus on \"young\" policies - and less obsession with pensions and inheritance tax might help?\nSome suggested politicians should \"care less\" about how they are portrayed in the media.\nA word of warning came from Daily Telegraph columnist Bryony Gordon: young voters don't want to see \"dad dancing\" and politicians hanging out with celebrities.\nEven getting on Twitter can be risky - with one person suggesting that David Cameron's Twitter account \"seems a bit like a robot\".\nThe subject of whether Russell Brand should be employed as some sort of ambassador for youth proved divisive. He's not to everyone's tastes.\nAnd the \"pantomime farce\" of Prime Minister's Questions impressed no-one on the panel - instead, cross-bencher Baroness Young of Hornsey suggested more consensus and grown-up conversations away from \"ideological bias\" might engage people more.\nSexism in the male-dominated corridors of power was highlighted by columnist Ms Gordon.\nShe said she had once been called a \"slut\" to her face by an MP who went on to become a minister.\n\"You have to sweep that culture out,\" she said - and using quotas to get more women into Parliament was one way to do it.\nMP Margot James said that while she was \"lukewarm\" on all-women shortlists, Labour's use of them had seen \"the terms of the debate change\". About 22% of MPs are women - \"20% of us is not enough\", she said.\n\"I think it's quite damaging for democracy.\"\nThere was a lot of feeling in the room that not enough was being done to educate children about politics from an early age. Bryony Gordon suggested that people were \"frightened of teaching politics\".\nOne A-level politics student admitted that \"sometimes things are so above my head - like the economy\". Others agreed. Her course concentrated more on the structure of UK and EU political bodies.\nTo make everyone feel better, Ms James quoted former PM Alec Douglas-Home: \"There are two problems in my life. The political ones are insoluble and the economic ones are incomprehensible.\"\nIf only more people would \"'fess up\" to not having all the answers, politics might be more engaging, the room heard.", "Boro looked to settle for a point after Simon Cox cancelled out Emilio Nsue's opener, but substitute Forshaw netted in injury time to win it.\nThe win took the Teessiders to the top of the Championship table.\n\"When Adam scored, once again we were together and the crowd was amazing,\" Karanka told BBC Tees.\n\"It was a difficult game, I can understand the frustration [of supporters] when they want us to win the games but they trust these players and together is best way to go about it.\"\nKaranka's side have won their past five games following the Spaniard's absence from the defeat at Charlton on 13 March, when he was contemplating his future.\nWith that episode resolved, Boro have rediscovered their form to lead the table from Burnley by two points.\n\"It was our third game at home in a row, and it's always difficult after the QPR game - people already had nine points in their pockets,\" he said.\n\"I feel how difficult is to win every game so now we're in a really good position, I'm pleased for them and I couldn't be prouder than I am at this moment.\"", "It follows the partial collapse of a railway embankment between Ashfield and Gilshochill.\nThe rail operator said tonnes of mud and stone had washed onto the track at Lambhill, weakening a footbridge over the track.\nServices from Glasgow Queen Street to Anniesland and Crianlarich have been cancelled for seven days as a result.\nScotRail said work was under way to stabilise the slope and assess the damage to the footbridge, which will need to be temporarily removed and reconstructed before the line can be reopened.\nThe company said a full bus replacement service would be in place for the half hourly service to Anniesland until 12 April, but warned commuters that the journey was likely to take longer.\nA bus service will also operate from Glasgow Queen Street to Crianlarich.\nRail services for the West Highland line will begin at Crianlarich and continue to all intermediate stations for Oban, Fort William and Mallaig.\nThe rail operator said the plan would be under daily review and could change.\nA ScotRail Alliance spokesman said: \"Our team has been on site since Tuesday morning assessing the damage and making plans to repair the line.\n\"We will be working around the clock to get the railway open as soon as possible, but extensive structural repairs will be needed to fix the significant damage caused to the footbridge.\"\nCustomers affected by the disruption can use ScotRail's Delay Repay compensation scheme, which applies to services that are delayed for 30 minutes or longer.\nThe cause of the landslip is currently under investigation.", "Denmark's centre-right government had wanted to abandon some Danish opt-outs from EU home affairs legislation.\nBut with all votes now counted, more than 53% said No to the proposals.\nThe vote comes weeks after the Paris attacks and as Europe struggles to deal with record numbers of migrants.\n\"It is a clear no,\" Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said, adding he had \"full respect\" for the voters' decision.\nProfile: Denmark's anti-EU party\nThe government, backed by the opposition, had campaigned for Yes, saying it would help Danish authorities in the wake of the Paris attacks.\nUltimately, voting No means Denmark remains exempt from large parts of the EU's criminal justice and home affairs system, a position it negotiated in 1993.\nIt risks losing access to Europol, Europe's crime and intelligence-sharing agency, a service frequently used by Denmark.\nThe confusing wording of the referendum question seems to have been a factor.\nOne voter described it as \"the most baffling in the history of the EU\", and on the foggy, wet streets of Copenhagen, that sentiment seemed to be shared by voters as they left polling stations, saying the question was too complicated and technical, and that explanations from politicians were not comprehensive.\nFor Denmark's government, urgent talks will now take place between Copenhagen and Brussels, to work out the ramifications of what the No vote means.\nThe result is likely to have been monitored by British politicians, interested to see with the upcoming UK referendum battle about to play out, how the gut instinct of the voters can be tied to current European events, and how the particular phrasing of the question can discourage or influence how tied-in to the European project Britons want to be.\nRead more from Gavin\nSeveral of the Paris attackers were French nationals who had been living in neighbouring Belgium. At least one surviving gunman, Salah Abdeslam, is thought to have fled across the French border in the aftermath of the shootings and suicide blasts in Paris on 13 November.\nThe result means Denmark will have to negotiate a special agreement to stay inside Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency which tackles organised crime and terrorism.\n\"We will work very hard for the Danes to get the best possible agreement. But it will be difficult,\" Soren Gade of the governing Venstre party told the Ritzau news agency.\nThe anti-immigration Danish People's Party (DPP), which props up Mr Rasmussen's administration in parliament, had urged voters to say No to avoid giving away further sovereignty to Brussels.\nAlthough a Yes vote would not have affected Denmark's opt-out on immigration, the DPP argued that it could eventually have led to immigration policies being dictated by the EU.\nUnlike Denmark, the UK and Ireland have opt-ins on justice and home affairs legislation, which enable them to choose whether to accept or reject legislation on a case-by-case basis.\nThe result of the referendum is likely to be of interest in Britain, whose government is trying to renegotiate its relations with the EU before holding a vote on whether to remain in the bloc.", "Anthony McCallen, 65, was chaplain at the now defunct St William's Children's Home in East Yorkshire, where James Carragher, 75, was head.\nThe pair denied a total of 87 sex offences against children at the home between the 1970s and the 1990s.\nLeeds Crown Court heard Carragher, a convicted sex offender from Merseyside, took boys naked swimming late at night.\nThe jury heard they both preyed on boys aged between 10 and 16 years old.\nIn total, 18 men gave evidence describing how they were indecently \"touched\".\nOne victim stormed out of court after telling the jury the pair had visited him as he slept and sexually assaulted him.\nAnother witness spoke of how boys were taken swimming \"after lights-out\" at the home and told not to \"wear any swimming trunks\".\nFollowing the verdict, Judge Jeffrey Marson QC praised members of the jury for the way they conducted themselves.\nHe said: \"I've never ever in many years of doing this had a jury who had to consider so many charges, it is way beyond the norm, and they are some of the most difficult charges to deal with\".\nCarragher, who was jailed for seven years in 1993 and 14 years in 2004 for sex offences, pleaded not guilty to 50 counts of indecent assault and 12 other serious sex offences.\nMcCallen, also of Merseyside, who was convicted of abusing two boys in the 1990s, denied 18 indecent assaults and seven other serious sexual offences.\nAfter a 10-week trial and 11 days of deliberations, the jury found Carragher guilty of 21 indecent assault and three serious sex offences, but he was cleared of a further 30 charges.\nMcCallen was found guilty on a total of 11 charges including a serious sexual offence.

Six said they were most likely to vote to leave and many others were still undecided.\nAfter hearing about Mr Cameron's package of proposed reforms to Britain's relationship with the EU, Lewes MP Maria Caulfield said she still intended to vote for Britain to leave the EU.\nShe said the issue of immigration had not been dealt with and the introduction of the living wage in April would encourage more people to come.\nBut it has to be said she is not alone - I also spoke to another Sussex MP this morning, Tim Loughton, who said he is not happy with the deal negotiated and is now also more inclined to vote out.\nAnd the South Thanet MP and former UKIP founder Craig Mackinlay said: \"The emergency brake sounded so hopeful some weeks ago.\n\"But the concept of 28 feet reaching for the pedal all wanting an influence really means that when a hazard is seen, indecision will mean that an accident will surely happen.\"\nWhat we still don't know is when this referendum will take place.\nThe First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to David Cameron urging him not to hold the EU referendum in June.\nThey said the campaigning would clash with their campaigns for parliamentary elections on 5 May.\nBut the Prime Minister would only confirm he would not hold it within six weeks of those May elections.\nThat still leaves the door open for the referendum to be held in June.\nIf that is the case, it gives the PM just four months to persuade some members of his cabinet, backbench MPs and - more importantly - the voters of the benefits of remaining part of the EU.", "Internationally-renowned photographer Spencer Tunick is to create a new work there to celebrate its year as UK City of Culture.\nThe gathering is to be photographed in the East Yorkshire port on 9 July, with the resulting work unveiled in 2017.\nOrganisers hope hundreds of people will strip to become part of the work, entitled Sea Of Hull.\nParticipants are to be covered in cosmetic body make-up, before assembling to form the multiple colours of the sea and create abstract shapes for the camera.\nNew York-based Tunick has created more than 90 similar human installations worldwide, including at the Sydney Opera House, Place des Arts in Montreal, Mexico City and Munich in Germany.\nHis work in the UK has used places including Gateshead and Folkestone as backdrops.\n\"I'm very interested in the history of the city and its place as a seafaring centre and its relationship to a rich maritime past,\" Tunick said of Hull.\n\"It intrigues me that in some places where there are major streets or parks today, previously there was water.\"\nHe said he hoped he would create \"a sea of humanity flooding the urban landscape\" and the body paint would help many people to overcome their inhibitions to posing naked.\nKirsten Simister, of Hull's Ferens Art Gallery, said: \"It's an opportunity to involve people directly in an amazing live performance that will temporarily transform the city.\"\nThe artist is to also create a second installation on 10 July inviting a select group of participants to take part in another event in North Lincolnshire.\nAnyone over 18 can take part.", "The incident, which saw one car come to rest in a field, took place on the southbound carriageway between junctions six and nine at about 10:30.\nOne of the injured people was airlifted to Ninewells Hospital and the other transported by ambulance.\nThe carriageway was closed following the collision, but reopened shortly before noon.", "Film studio Warner Bros is looking for a girl between the ages of eight and 12 to play the character of Modesty.\n\"Modesty is a haunted young girl with an inner strength and stillness,\" the studio said. \"She has an ability to see deep into people and understand them.\"\nThe casting call will take place at the Excel Centre in London on Saturday.\nThe chosen youngster will star opposite Eddie Redmayne in what is bound to be one of the biggest film releases of next year.\nRowling has written the script for the film, which is based on a Harry Potter spin-off book she published in 2001.\nRedmayne will play \"magizoologist\" Newt Scamander, who writes a Hogwarts School textbook about the weird and wonderful fictional creatures he encounters.\nHopeful actresses have been invited to start queuing from 9am on Saturday.\nThey will follow in the footsteps of actors Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who played Ron Weasley and first heard about Harry Potter auditions on Newsround more than 15 years ago.\nFantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is expected to be released on 18 November 2016.", "The regulator, The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has already warned that up to 670,000 consumers face such fees.\nIn a survey of people withdrawing cash from their pension, Citizens Advice found those with smaller funds were paying proportionately larger charges.\nThose with pension pots of less than \u00a320,000 typically paid \u00a31966 in fees.\nThe regulator is planning to introduce a cap of 1% on such fees, from March 2017.\nBut Citizens Advice said even that cap would be too high.\nIt is calling for a standard \u00a350 charge to cover the providers' administration costs.\n\"The threat of excessive charges can also put people off making the right pension choices for them,\" said Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice.\n\"A standard \u00a350 exit fee across all types of pensions will mean consumers can make the most of the pension freedoms.\"\nThe survey was based on 500 people who had taken money out of their pensions since April 2015, when the pension freedoms began.", "Anthony Francis was attempting to \"drift\" in his Mercedes at the event on 8 August last year when he lost control, ploughing into the spectators.\nSeveral other people suffered less serious injuries in the crash, Peterborough Crown Court heard.\nFrancis, 21, of Lambeth Walk, Stamford, pleaded guilty to six dangerous driving offences and was jailed for 18 months.\nHe was also disqualified from driving for two years.\nPolice were called at about 23:30 BST to an industrial area in Stapledon Road, Orton Southgate, where hundreds of people had gathered, the court was told.\nFrancis was arrested charged with five counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and one count of dangerous driving.

the once invincible-seeming US corporate food giant whose arches are seen across the globe - is struggling, as health-conscious consumers eschew its food in the US and workers stage day-long protests against the company.\nThat has made this shareholder meeting - the first since British-born chief executive Steve Easterbrook took over the firm in January - a crucial focus of both worker angst and investor frustration.\nMcDonald's banned media from attending the event, and has sought to dismiss both worker complaints and investor efforts to change the management of the firm.\nOn a chilly morning outside the company's headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, hundreds of protestors chanted slogans such as \"supersize my wages\" as shareholders arrived at the meeting.\nA dozen police prevented the protestors from interacting with the attendees, who were required to show their shareholder ballots emblazoned with a large red 2015 stamp to a security guard before being allowed in.\nSome protestors carried oversize checks with the weekly wages of \"actual McDonald's workers\" - $62.18 and $34.07.\nMany had travelled from across the country - New York City, Tampa, and Philadelphia - to hand in a petition of a million signatures demanding McDonald's raise the minimum wage it pays workers.\nThey said they were energised by the Los Angeles' city council's announcement on Tuesday that it had voted to increase the minimum wage in the city to $15 per hour by 2020.\nSince 2012, the group - known as the Fast for 15 coalition - has been putting pressure on corporations to increase wages from the current US federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour to a \"living wage\" of $15.\nMany experts have said that the group has been successful in exerting pressure on firms such as Walmart, Target, and others to raise wages.\n\"Part of the [wage increases] are due to the fact that as the economy has improved, [corporations] need to do something to hold on to workers - Walmart was having trouble keeping goods stocked in their stores,\" Professor Ken Jacobs, head of the University of California-Berkeley's Labor Center, told the BBC.\n\"But I don't think McDonald's, without all the protests, would have acted.\n\"I think the workers [who], really quite courageously, went out on strike have really inspired and moved something that's very big and will have long-term repercussions.\"\nLawrence Yancy, a lifelong Chicagoan, has worked in fast food since he graduated high school in 1989, after which he got a job at Wendy's.\nHe is just one of many workers here who are frustrated with the gap between how much McDonald's executives are paid versus the restaurant employees.\n\"I'm tired of struggling all the time,\" he told the BBC during a break from the protests at his small and slightly run-down one bedroom apartment in the Kimball neighbourhood. The area is close to Hyde Park, near where US President Barack Obama lives.\nHe has worked as a grill cook at a Chicago McDonald's since January 2003 and says he was inspired to join the movement after labour organisers visited his store last year as part of an effort by the Service Employees International Union to get fast food workers to join a union.\nHe says he is frustrated that his wages have barely budged from the $5.50 per hour he started making when he first joined the company, to the $8.40 he makes now.\n\"I just want to be able to save - and maybe buy some new clothes,\" he said.\nMcDonald's has dismissed the protests as not being indicative of workers at the firm and its franchises more generally.\nThis \"is the latest instance in an $80m publicity campaign organized and paid for by the Service Employees International Union and its members,\" said the company in a statement.\n\"As has been the case in earlier protests, very few McDonald's or independent franchisee employees are participating.\"\nBut many shareholders took pictures of the protests as they headed into the meeting - which could further add to investor concerns, as well as influencing voting at the meeting.\nLate on Wednesday, large institutional investors released a letter calling for McDonald's and other firms to amend the way investors can decide who sits on the company's board through a move known as \"proxy access\".\nThe investors include the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) and the New York City Pension Funds - who control a combined $860bn in assets.\nThe heads of pension funds in New York City, Chicago, and California wrote in a letter that the move was an effort to challenge the company's decision to buy back shares to please investors, at the expense of long-term growth.\n\"McDonalds is facing serious performance challenges. But despite a recently announced and much needed turnaround plan, the company continues to direct capital towards an aggressive share buyback programme,\" they wrote in a letter.\nThey said that these buybacks should instead be directed at increasing worker wages, in addition to being reinvested in the company.\nMcDonald's urged shareholders to vote against the move. Despite the opposition, 61% of voting shareholders approved the proxy access bylaw.\n\"We'll be evaluating the advisory vote, and the board will consider it to determine what's appropriate,\" McDonald's said in a statement.", "\"Good morning! We have a new constituent assembly!\" began President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as he greeted his supporters in the Plaza Bol\u00edvar in Caracas shortly after the electoral authorities announced the result.\nThe country's National Electoral Council said that just a little over eight million ballots had been cast for members of a a new assembly designed to change the country's constitution, a turnout of 41.53% of the electorate.\nBut the opposition boycotted the vote, guaranteeing victory for the country's socialist government, which had convened the vote. Amid the electoral violence, at least 10 deaths were reported across the country.\nHowever President Maduro faces a real challenge of governability and credibility.\nPerhaps the biggest is that every opposition supporter, and many millions of ordinary Venezuelans, simply do not believe the result.\n\"The government will claim eight million votes, but in reality it could have been about 3.5 million people,\" predicted pollster Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n a day before the poll.\nThe opposition say several irregular electoral processes took place that in normal Venezuelan elections would not be allowed.\nFor example, no indelible ink was used to mark voters' little fingers after the ballots had been cast and critics say there was nothing to stop people voting in more than one polling centre.\nThere were also widespread reports of pressure being brought to bear on government employees to turn out in order to protect their jobs.\nSeveral countries in the region - including Colombia, Argentina and Panama - said they would not recognise the result.\nThe United States also threatened \"strong and swift action\", with the US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, calling the vote a \"sham election\" that brought Venezuela \"another step toward dictatorship\".\nNevertheless, the Maduro government is treating this result as a resounding endorsement and will press ahead with its plans to change the constitution. The first steps towards creating the new body could take place within 24 hours.\nIn part, the difficulty the Maduro government has faced in motivating its base stems from the many years they spent vociferously defending the same constitution they are now urgently trying to change.\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez himself often described the 1999 Constitution in sacred terms, comparing it to the Bible or the Mayan holy text, Popol Vuh.\nThe approach of most government officials has been twofold.\nIn part, they say the creation of a constituent assembly is the easiest route to peace - something that most ordinary Venezuelans are desperate to see return to their daily lives.\nThey also argue that this constitutional change is part of a vision of a \"deeper\" form of popular democracy that the late socialist leader was never able to fully realise before his death in 2013.\nIf so, however, he never made any great references to it while he was still alive: \"Our constitution, one of the best in the world, is protected from the caprice of any political group,\" he said in 2008.\n\"In Venezuela, no-one can change a comma, a full stop, a letter of our Bolivarian Constitution. Only the Venezuelan people can do that through a national referendum,\" Mr Ch\u00e1vez explained.\nA pro-government candidate standing in a low-income neighbourhood in the east of Caracas, Joaquin Mijares, denied that the vote was unconstitutional.\n\"The constituent assembly will be a space to discuss the direction of the country and how the state is organised,\" he said outside his local polling station.\n\"The process is legitimate because we, the people, are legitimising it with our participation.\"\nHowever, the haemorrhaging of traditional Chavista support goes beyond this one controversial political process. It comes after months of food shortages, rampant inflation and worsening violence.\nOne does not have to look hard for signs of public exhaustion with the Maduro government.\n\"Sadly, my President, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, died. Very sadly, because if he were alive, none of this would be happening,\" said Beatriz, a housewife in Catia, in western Caracas.\n\"I'll stay Chavista until the very end but I'm no Maduro supporter,\" she added.  It is a position shared by many others among the nation's poor.\nThere is a uniquely Venezuelan word to describe the street closures and subsequent clashes with the authorities: \"guarimba\".\nNow, with the votes cast, there is still no sign of the barricades and protests letting up.\nIf anything, positions are becoming more entrenched. \"The Resistance\" - a loose alliance of young, radicalised opposition protesters - have vowed to remain on the streets until the government concedes to their demands.\n\"We're going to be here until this country changes, until it improves, until the government falls,\" a 17-year-old protester manning the barricades told me.\n\"We need a president who's dignified enough to be called the president of Venezuela and an end to the shortages and queues.\"\nThe traditional opposition alliance, the MUD, also appears to remain committed to a campaign of demonstrations and civil disobedience. The government places the blame for the violence firmly at the door of the opposition.\nBut the head of the National Assembly, Julio Borges, denied that the MUD was responsible for leading the country down a path towards further conflict.\n\"We are not involved in a civil war in Venezuela,\" he said. \"What we have in Venezuela is one people, one nation that is against a minority that has kidnapped power in the country.\"\nOn the other side, the military and the security forces are not backing down either. Despite suggestions of disillusionment among some sectors of the rank and file, there is little hard evidence of a genuine split or mutiny.\nBoth before the vote and in his victory speech, President Maduro spoke of dialogue. Some nations have been trying to table negotiations between the two sides with figures like former Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero attempting to broker some form of peace.\nSpain, in particular, would want to see a stable Venezuela sooner rather than later, given its business interests in the South American nation.\nHowever, there is little sign of a breakthrough. If anything, the decision to plough ahead with the election, despite widespread opposition, may have jeopardised any chance of further conversations for the time being.\nFurthermore, despite the unity in the name of the opposition alliance, in reality the parties remain divided, split and without a clear leader who inspires Venezuelans. As such, the immediate outlook is bleak, says Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n.\n\"It's absolutely going to get worse before it improves.\"\n\"The two groups both think they are in power. They both think they are going to destroy the other, that they are going to pulverise each other.\"\nSuch \"mutually assured destruction\", he argues, does nothing to tackle the problems of inflation, scarcity, poverty, lack of medicines and so on that have plagued Venezuela in recent years.\nIt seems, at least in the short term, Venezuelans face an unenviable and uncertain period as their country continues its gradual descent into anarchy.", "The 32-year-old talks of the pride she feels in leading a business that has been run by her family for 88 years.\nThe store in the southern Indian city of Chennai was first opened by her great-great-grandfather in 1928.\nOver the decades Nalli has become one of India's best-known brands of saris. The traditional Indian garment for women, saris are lengths of wide fabric which are first wrapped around the waist and then draped over one shoulder.\nLavanya says the brand's heritage and reputation for selling the finest silk saris are central to its continuing appeal.\nAnd with annual revenues of more than $100m (\u00a376m) across 29 Indian stores, plus outlets in Singapore and California, business remains strong.\nYet as a growing number of Indian women are choosing to wear Western clothing, or less formal Indian garments, Lavanya is using business skills she gained from spending several years away from the family company to introduce new product lines and take the firm into e-commerce.\nNalli is renowned for selling hand-woven silk saris, which are made from the artisan weavers in the Kanchipuram district of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\nThese saris are known for their opulence, their fine fabric, vibrant colours and intricate designs, which range from floral and peacock motifs to checks and stripes.\nThey are popular as special occasion wear for celebrations, festivals and marriages, and the most beautiful are passed on from one generation to the next.\nThey are also not cheap, with the most intricate examples costing as much as $3,100 (\u00a32,350).\nAs a child Lavanya says it was impossible for her not to take an interest in both the company and retailing in general, because her father and grandfather would forever discuss business at the dinner table.\n\"Work and personal life were amazingly integrated,\" she says.\nLavanya herself formally joined the business in 2005, when she was 21. She stayed for four years, before deciding that she wanted to leave to learn about different ways of doing things.\nSo she first went to the prestigious Harvard Business School in the US to get an MBA (master of business administration).\nShe then worked with business consulting firm McKinsey in Chicago from 2011 to 2013.\nReturning to India in 2014, she then spent a year with an online fashion retailer called Myntra, before finally rejoining the family business in 2015.\nWith all the experience she had gained while she was away, she says her family were happy to let her take the lead at Nalli.\nThe challenge Lavanya faces is responding to the continuing change in the fashion tastes of Indian women, which is seeing many of them wear saris far less often.\n\"Saris were the only choice and preference Indian women had for a very long time, and that has changed over the years,\" she says.\nWhile saris still dominate on Indian city streets, it doesn't take long to spot young women in Western casual wear such as jeans, t-shirts and shirts.\nThey are buying these from shops opened in India by the likes of Sweden's H&M, and US chain Gap.\nLess formal Indian clothing such as kurtis (a stitched long shirt) and salwar kameez (dresses) have also grown in popularity, especially on college campuses and in the workplace.\nAmit Gugnani, a fashion expert at Indian management consultancy business Technopak, explains the growing challenge for companies like Nalli.\nHe says: \"Indian fashion consumers have become more experimental and image-conscious.\n\"A strong and growing economy coupled with better job prospects, higher disposable income and profound impact of media and technology is revolutionising [the] buying behaviour of Indian consumers.\n\"It is a fairly large challenge to be able to cater to the modern day Indian consumer - it is a fine balance between understanding the consumer and educating them at the same time about the offering your brand has.\"\nWhile Nalli has no plans to introduce Western-style clothing, under Lavanya's direction it has launched a range of kurtis and salwar kameez.\nThe company has also launched a range of more affordable saris, made from cheaper fabrics, such as a blend of polyester and cotton. This has brought prices down to as low as $2.20 per sari, a fraction of the price of the most expensive silk versions.\nLavanya says that while saris remain the \"major revenue generator for the company\", Nalli has \"adopted the changing preference of consumers\".\nWhile Lavanya has led the development of the company's website, to enable sales from around the world, she still intends for the business to double its number of physical stores by 2020.\nShe says her family continues to support her efforts, particularly because she provides detailed business plans.\n\"Our set-up is very entrepreneurial, which allows us to keep thinking about different ways of doing things,\" says Lavanya.\n\"So whenever I have an inclination or hunch, I find data that validates my hypothesis. This makes me more confident to chase it further, and my family supports it.\n\"I'm really grateful to be in the position that I am in today. There is a deep sense of pride to be part of a historic brand that my family has built.\"", "Warwick University researchers studied geo-tagged tweets and mobile phone use over a two-month period in Milan.\nIn two locations with known visitor numbers - a football stadium and an airport - these activities rose and fell in close step with flow of people.\nThe team said it could enable measurement of events such as protests.\nOther researchers emphasised that there were limitations and biases within this type of data - for example, only a subset of the population uses smartphones and Twitter and not all areas are well served by mobile phone towers.\nBut the study's authors said the results were \"a very good starting point\" for making more of these estimates - with greater accuracy - in the future.\n\"These are the numbers - the calibration examples - that we can draw on,\" said co-author Dr Tobias Preis. \"Obviously it would be even better if there were training examples in other countries, other environments, other time periods. Human behaviour is not constant around the globe.\n\"But it's a very, very good base to build on, to provide initial estimates.\"\nThe work, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, is part of a big and growing research field exploring what online activity can reveal about human behaviour and other real-world phenomena.\nFederico Botta, the PhD student who led the analysis, said the mobile phone-based approach had advantages over other methods for estimating crowd sizes.\n\"This is very quick,\" Mr Botta told BBC News. \"It does not rely on human judgement, it only relies on having the data related to mobile phones, or Twitter activity.\"\nWithin two months of mobile data provided by Telecom Italia as part of its Big Data Challenge, Mr Botta and his colleagues concentrated on Linate Airport and the San Siro football stadium, home to both AC Milan and Inter Milan.\nThey compared the number of people known to be in those two places, based on flight schedules and football ticket sales, with three measures of mobile phone activity: the number of phonecalls and text messages, the amount of internet use, and volume of tweets.\n\"What we saw was that indeed these activities\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 had a strikingly similar behaviour to the number of people,\" Mr Botta said.\nThis may not seem surprising - but particularly within the football stadium, the team saw such a reliable pattern that they could make predictions.\nThere were 10 football matches during the analysis period. Based on data from any nine of those games, the researchers could predict how many were at the tenth game based purely on mobile internet data.\nBut how accurate were they?\n\"Our mean absolute percentage error is about 13%,\" Mr Botta said. \"That means that our estimate and the actual number of people differ in absolute value by roughly 13%.\"\nThis is pretty good, the team said, compared with traditional techniques that rely on images, grids and human judgement. They pointed to the famous example of the 1995 \"Million Man March\" in Washington DC, where even the most careful analysis could only produce an estimate to within 20% - after initial statements varied wildly from 400,000 to 2 million.\nCo-author Dr Suzy Moat said the football stadium results were even better than the team had hoped.\n\"This is the kind of thing you really hope you'll find, and you're not normally lucky enough to see,\" she told the BBC. \"It's really striking that we're seeing quite such a close correspondence between the telecommunications data and the crowd size estimates.\"\nDr Ed Manley is a lecturer at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. He said this technique had a lot of potential and that people should be \"optimistic but cautious\" about using phone data in this way.\n\"We've got these massive data sets and there's a lot to be done with them... But we need to remain cautious about how far we push the data,\" Dr Manley said.\nHe explained that it would be important to remember that data from smartphones would not measure the population evenly.\n\"There are potentially biases there. Who are we measuring in these data sets?\" Twitter, he noted as an example, has a relatively young and affluent user base.\nDr Manley also said it would be important to choose the measurement carefully because people use mobiles for different things in different places - perhaps more for phonecalls at the airport and for tweets at the football, for example.\nAnd crucially, the whole analysis hinges on mobile phone signal - which is notoriously variable from place to place, and prone to dropping out.\n\"If we're relying on these data sets to tell us where people are, what happens when we have a problem with the way that data is collected?\" Dr Manley said.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter.", "While the search has been going on, more than 20 pieces of possible debris have been found by members of the public, on the African coast and islands in the Indian Ocean. Most have been handed in to French authorities or the Australian Transport Safety Bureau which has been co-ordinating the search (ATSB).\nSo far only a handful have been confirmed as \"definitely\" or \"almost certainly\" from the doomed plane.\nThe flaperon was the first piece of potential debris found. In September 2015 French judicial authorities who examined it confirmed it did come from MH370. One of three numbers found on the part matched up with the plane's serial number, 9M-MRO.\nInvestigators say this piece has identification numbers belonging to parts that were uniquely made for Malaysia Airlines and incorporated into MH370's plane.\nOne of the largest pieces of debris found so far, this piece had identification numbers and date stamps tallying with those belonging to MH370 parts.\nAlso known as \"676EB\", this piece has a stencilled number with the same font and colour used by Malaysia Airlines. Investigators also found that the part had been repainted, which matched the maintenance records for MH370.\nThe ATSB says the stencilling of the words \"No Step\" is consistent with that used by Malaysia Airlines. It also has a fastener matching those used in assembly of aircraft next in the production line of MH370's aircraft.\nThis piece carries the logo of Rolls-Royce which manufactures parts for Boeing. The ATSB says the stencil closely matched that used on other Boeing-777s owned by Malaysian Airlines.\nATSB investigators say that the presence of a hinge and a trim line indicate this was likely part of a closet panel that contained a foldable work-table. Its decorative pattern also matches that of Malaysia Airlines' Boeing-777 aircraft, and is not used by any other airlines' Boeing-777s.\nMany pieces of debris are still being evaluated for links to MH370.\nThese include items found by Blaine Gibson, an American lawyer who has gone on self-funded expeditions around the world to look for MH370 debris. Among other things, in Madagascar he found a seat back panel that could have housed a monitor.\nThese pieces initially sparked speculation that a fire had broken out onboard MH370, as they appear to have burn marks or discolouration caused by burning.\nBut the ATSB found that the discolouration was caused by the presence of resin. One item had small marks from \"localised heating\", but it was unclear how those marks were made.\nAustralian authorities have cast doubt on the fire theory and say work is still ongoing to determine if these pieces belong to a Boeing-777 aircraft.\nAnother piece found on Kangaroo Island in Australia in June 2016, which had the words \"Caution No Step\" stencilled on it, was thought to confirm that the aeroplane went down in the \"seventh arc\" of the southern Indian Ocean, where search efforts have focused on.\nThe ATSB said later that the piece did not match Boeing manufacturing specifications and thus could not have come from a Boeing aircraft.", "The 24-year-old former Poland Under-21 international joined Town from Polish side Korona Kielce on a two-year contract in the summer.\nBut he has been restricted to just six appearances and moves to a team currently ninth in League One.\nMeanwhile, Ipswich have extended midfielder Ben Pringle's loan from Fulham until the end of the season.\nThe 26-year-old has made seven appearances for Mick McCarthy's side since joining in February, scoring in 1-0 wins over Huddersfield and Nottingham Forest.\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.", "The Russian foreign minister criticised the \"counter-productive\" nature of Moldova's \"unfriendly actions\".\nThe diplomats, who were not named, were given three days to leave Russia.\nMoldova's pro-EU government has not explained the expulsions.

All three were found dead on 12 October, 2014.\nThe serious case review reported that on Friday 3 October, 2014 Mrs Galikowska, a Polish national, was seen by a GP with husband Marcin, who made the appointment after becoming concerned about his wife's mental state.\nAfter Mrs Galikowska admitted having thoughts about killing herself and her children, the GP referred her to mental health professionals and told her they should contact her later that day.\nThe doctor was told \"urgent referrals service-users will be contacted within four hours\", the review said.\nBut, neither the GP nor the call taker referred the case to children's social care and as a result professionals did not visit the family until Sunday 5 October.\nThe serious case review concluded this referral should have been made and the case would then have been \"treated correctly\" as a child protection investigation.\nFurther telephone calls were made on 6 October, but after a surprise visit on 7 October the mother's mental health was not judged to have deteriorated and the mental health service announced it was closing the case two days later.\nThe review criticised the \"extremely concerning\" delay between the GP's referral and mental health workers visiting the family and described further telephone calls in place of home visits as \"poor practice\".\n\"There is a pattern in Stoke-on-Trent of professionals making assumptions about other teams/agencies' roles, responses and remit, which can leave families vulnerable and both professionals and families with false expectations,\" it said.\nHowever, the review acknowledged \"without the benefit of hindsight it is understandable\" mental health workers did not believe the children were in immediate danger because of Mrs Galikowska's behaviour and her husband's support at visits.\nJohn Wood, chairman of the Stoke-on-Trent Safeguarding Children Board, said improvements had been made since the Galikowska case, including establishing a 24-hour mental health and social care access team.\n\"The devastating events united a whole community in grief and have been treated with the utmost seriousness by the city council, the

serve a minimum of 19 years.\nMr Xu, who was from China but had been staying with his daughter Diana, was left with 28 injuries to his head and neck as well as a laceration and bruising to his genital

suffered additional degradation when you removed his lower clothing and dragged him along the street,\" he said.\nHe said Richardson, who had been at a New Year's Eve house party, left his victim \"dying in the gutter\".\nThe court heard after the attack Richardson went to the house of friend Luke Jenkinson, 22, in nearby De Lacy Street, where he changed and washed his clothes.\nMr McEntee said friends had reported Richardson telling them he had \"kicked and stamped\" on Mr Xu's head.\nThe court heard Mr Xu's wife and daughter were unable to complete a victim statement as they were too distressed.\nJohn Jones QC, representing Richardson, said he was \"a young man with the most disadvantaged background and upbringing\" who had been diagnosed with a personality disorder and learning

He is being made to be the fall guy.\n\"Before you do that, you have to look at the whole evidence in this case.\"\nDuring his closing argument, Mr Findlay also referred to Rangers' early Champions League exit against Swedish side Malmo after Mr Whyte took the helm at Ibrox in 2011.\nHe told the court: \"If Rangers had made the league section of the Champions League, do we actually think we would be here today?\n\"The probability is no.\"\nThe court heard claims that the defeat cost the club up to \u00a320m in lost income.\nThe QC also pointed out that there had been \"no loss\" to Sir David Murray in the buyout.\nMr Findlay spoke of the share purchase agreement, signed as part of the takeover.\nThe document makes reference to \"third party resources\".\nThe QC went on: \"What did Murray's advisers do about it? Absolutely nothing. Why not? It is because what mattered was getting the deal over the finishing line.\"\nThe trial has previously heard claims \"nothing\" was spent on \"due diligence\" into Mr Whyte's background before the buyout.\nMr Findlay said it seemed the Murray team had been \"more focused\" on securing a sale.\nThe QC later pointed to an email from Michael McGill which included reference to Whyte's \"other investors\".\nMr Findlay added: \"What is the only question if you are really concerned about the source of the money?\n\"It is \"who are they...what other investors?'.\"\nBut, Mr Findlay said the Murray side did \"absolutely nothing\" in that regard.\nHe told jurors: \"Only one conclusion can be drawn from that - it did not matter that there were other investors.

It was sparked by the FCA's handling of a number of controversies, over interest rate swaps, and the management of the Connaught Income Fund (nearly 50 MPs - an impressive number - attended a recent adjournment debate on that issue) but most of all because the FCA has dropped plans for an inquiry into the culture of the financial services industry, a decision which has alarmed a number of MPs.\nIn Westminster Hall (from 4.30pm) MPs debate e-petition 110776 on transitional state pension arrangements for women born in the 1950s: \"The government must make fair transitional arrangements for all women born on or after 6th April 1951 who have unfairly borne the burden of the increase to the State Pension Age (SPA). Hundreds of thousands of women have had significant changes imposed on them with a lack of appropriate notification.\" Helen Jones, the chair of the Petitions Committee, will lead the debate.\nIn the Lords (from 2.30pm) there's more committee stage debate on the Immigration Bill, where the key issues include immigration detention, \"deport first appeal later\", migrant support, and family reunion. The dinner break business is a short debate on the effects of neglected tropical diseases in impairing social and economic development in developing countries.\nTuesday\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am for Business, Innovation and Skills questions - and that's followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Lib Dem former Scottish secretary, Alistair Carmichael. His Mobile Telecommunications Network Coverage (Contractual Obligations) Bill aims to strengthen the rights of consumers who purchase mobile phone contracts which do not provide the advertised service; they're promised four bars of signal in his Orkney and Shetland constituency and get none.\nAfter that, MPs have their first debate on the Enterprise Bill - which creates a Small Business Commissioner, to deal with late payment of bills. An estimated \u00a327bn is owed to small and medium-sized businesses. The bill also has measures dealing with deregulation and apprenticeships.\nIn Westminster Hall the day's debates include regional airports and UK airports capacity (9.30am-11am) and gender pricing (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (from 2.30pm) there will be ping-pong on two bills from the Commons: the Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill - where no vote is expected, but key issues are housing and the Charity Commission. Then peers turn to ping-pong on the Childcare Bill - Labour is working on getting into scope a report on the effectiveness of the government's childcare proposals - and they may force that issue to a vote.\nThen peers turn to an important statutory instrument: the Feed-in Tariffs (Amendment) Order, a measure which effectively cuts the subsidies to various forms of green energy; there's a Labour regret motion and a Lib Dem fatal motion, which Labour will abstain on.\nWednesday\nThe Commons opens at 11.30am, with International Development questions, followed, at noon by  Prime Minister's Question Time - first in the batting order is Labour awkward squaddie John Mann, one of those behind Monday's debate on the FCA; anyone care to bet against him raising the issue with the PM?\nPMQs is followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Automatic Electoral Registration, from the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, to ensure the accuracy of electoral registers. The bill proposes to automatically register everyone accessing a public service (that is everyone who applies for a driving license, everyone who has a National Insurance number, or receives a benefit), thereby making it much easier to keep an accurate and complete register.\nShe quotes estimates that the government's new system of Individual Voter Registration will lead to one million voters falling off the electoral register: the bill proposes to reverse this trend.\nThe day's main debates are on Labour motions on tax avoidance and multinational companies - and then on public finances in Scotland. And that's followed by an adjournment debate on child dental health, led by the Conservative, Sir Paul Beresford. Tooth decay is one of the main reasons young children arrive at A&E, and the House's resident dentist will explore the issue.\nIn Westminster Hall, the day's debates include: fuel poverty (9.30am- 11am); Bryan Evans and the Serious Fraud Office (11am- 11.30am); and government investment in cycling (4.30 -5.30pm).\nMy eye was caught by the debate on changes to the level of local government funding (2.30pm - 4pm). Former Labour leadership contender Liz Kendall will open a general debate, designed to encourage as many MPs as possible to raise their particular concerns about the future of local government in an era of austerity.\nIn the Lords, the main business is the continuation of detailed committee stage consideration of the Immigration Bill, where peers will be looking at the issues of unaccompanied refugee children, border security and language requirements for public sector workers. During the dinner break, the House will consider a Lib Dem regret motion on the Housing benefit, abolition of the Family Premium and Date of Claim Regulations. It's not expected to be pushed to a vote.\nThursday\nThe Commons meets at 9.30am for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions; then mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the Public Accounts Commission and Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission. After the weekly Commons Business statement from the Leader of the House, the rest of the day is devoted to debates chosen by the Backbench Business Committee.\nFirst is a select committee statement from Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the committee's report The collapse of Kids Company: lessons for charity trustees, professional firms, the Charity Commission, and Whitehall.\nThen comes debates on Parliamentary sovereignty and EU renegotiations and conflict in Yemen. On the first of those, the debate was applied for by the Conservative John Baron who believes the prime minister has not made a restoration of UK Parliamentary sovereignty a priority in his EU renegotiation.\n\"Without the restoration of sovereignty, everything else is peripheral,\" Mr Baron said. \"We should by ourselves be able to stop unwanted directives, taxes and regulation. I look forward to the Government's response in the debate, given many of us have been unsuccessful in engaging with the Prime Minister.\"\nThe adjournment debate is on the Delay Repay scheme for rail commuters - led by the Lib Dem, Tom Brake.\nThe Westminster Hall debate (1.30pm) is on the role of men in preventing violence against women.\nIn the Lords, business in the Chamber begins at 11am - and the main event is the third reading of the Education and Adoption Bill - the key issue outstanding is the new regional schools commissioners created under the Bill.\nLabour peer and human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy then leads debates on both the EU Committee's report Subsidiarity Assessment: Reform of the electoral law of the EU and on a reasoned opinion on the European Parliament's proposed decision on the election of MEPs. The final business in the Chamber is a debate on the EU Committee's report on Capital Markets Union: a welcome start.\nFriday\nIt's another private members' bill day in the Commons (from 9.30am) opening with detailed consideration of the Conservative Mike Wood's Riot Compensation Bill, and then William Wragg's Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill.\nIf those are completed (and there seems to be a consistent pattern of padding out these report stage debates)  there might be a little time left to allow a mini-second reading debate on Peter Bone's Ovarian Cancer (Information) Bill, but I doubt Christopher Chope's Bat Habitats Regulation Bill will be reached.\nOne other Friday trend to watch out for is for the granting of urgent questions, which used to be quite a rarity on Fridays, when the Commons tends to be thinly-attended.\nThe Speaker's Office always insists that these are decided on merit, but I can't help wondering if some kind of message is being sent, about the increasing tendency to slip policy announcements out on a Thursday, when they might not be noticed by departing MPs.", "Katie Parke was diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis as a toddler. It means deposits build up in the lungs making it hard to breathe.\nA 3D printed windpipe was used by doctors to practice delicate surgery before an operation to clean her lungs.\nSharon Parke said

her lungs cleaned.\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis requires regular washing of the lungs with saltwater to remove the deposits.\nAccording to research by the team, there are only three children worldwide that have the disease.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Ms Parke explained how her daughter was first diagnosed.\n\"When Katie was three and a half she took severe pneumonia and they couldn't get her off the oxygen so they sent her for further investigation up at the Royal.\n\"They diagnosed that her and at the time the signs weren't good for Katie because she was in such poor health.\"\nShe said surgeons had ever worked on someone so young or so small.\n\"They found it very hard to get the right tubing's and pipes to fit Katie's throat,\" Ms Parke said.\n\"To put Katie under anaesthetic, there's always a risk she won't pull through.\n\"They were able to make a trachea perfectly proportioned to Katie's, which meant prior to operations, they were able to work with different tubing to fit her trachea and that saved a lot of time in surgery.\"\nDuring Katie's operation, one of her lungs needed to be ventilated while the other was cleaned.\nThe technology meant that Katie spent less time under anaesthetic and being ventilated.\nShirley McKenna, the principal of Glendermott Primary School in Derry, said Katie was an inspiration.\n\"For her grit, her determination in how she's faced the challenges in life, she's an absolute credit to us as a school and her family.\n\"She's an amazing wee girl.\"", "Police said the four men, aged 20, 31, 40 and 42,

representing the New Forest National Park Authority voted in favour of instigating the Cycle Charter.\nThere are 30 clauses containing guidance for people organising cycling events in the New Forest.\nThe cap on the number of cyclists in large events has been called \"discriminatory\" by CTC, the national cycling charity.\nNew Forest National Park Authority chairman Oliver Crosthwaite-Eyre said: \"The vast majority of cycle events are under this threshold and have been operating without any complaint for many years.\n\"The figure of 1,000 has been well received by parish councils.\n\"We hope that all event organisers will follow the charter's criteria even if they don't agree with it all.\"\nThe charter will be sent to all cycle event organisers, the authority said.\nThe Safety

loosely justified on safety grounds.\n\"It is therefore mystifying and incredibly frustrating that our amendment, which placed the Safety Advisory Group at the very heart of decision-making for each

second-round game on Wednesday.\nThornton didn't have a shot at a double in the opening six legs of the match as his poor scoring allied to Gurney's superb 105 average allowed the Northern Irishman to storm into a two sets lead.\nGurney won the first leg of set three after Thornton, 49, missed five shots at a double but a 180 helped the Scot open his account in the next and he went on to clinch the set thanks to 12 and 13-dart legs as his form suddenly improved.\nThornton's average exceeded 105 in sets four and five as his run of nine out of 12 legs helped move him 3-2 ahead, as Gurney's form dipped considerable.\nHowever after Thornton won the opening leg in set six, his failure to set up a routine double top shot in the next as he instead had to aim for double 18, which he missed, granted Gurney a reprieve.\nGurney then produced his 161 out shot to move 2-1 ahead in the set before winning the next to ensure the decider.\nThornton missed shots at double top and double 10 in the opening leg of the final set and as the Scot's game became increasingly ragged amid a couple of unlucky bounce-outs, Gurney held his nerve to win the next two legs.\nA relieved Gurney told Sky Sports

But many others organisations, such as the UN, put the figure as high as 80-94% - the size of the country's informal sector makes an accurate figure hard to gauge.\nZimbabwe is a country of \"enormous disparities between a very wealthy few and the impoverished mass, with a squeezed middle,\" says Sue Onslow, of the Africa international affairs programme at the London School of Economics.\n\"The economy's doing much better than it was in 2008-2009, but it's started to falter.\n\"The lack of a stable policy environment has been a cause for concern for the international business community that wants to put substantial investment into the country.\"\nBut the government's room for manoeuvre seems to be limited.\nMr Kanyenze says: \"Even before the election, 70% of the budget was going on employment costs, so very little was remaining for service delivery or rehabilitating the infrastructure, which implies that all those issues which are critical for growing the economy - dealing with power outages, water shortages, the decay of infrastructure, the cost of capital and dealing with the out-datedness of technology... those issues are not going to be dealt with.\n\"We are in a survivalist mode at the moment, with very little in the state coffers at the moment.\"", "The Family Sharing initiative will let a user of the Steam service share their library of games across up to 10 other devices.\nOther people will be able to play the titles, store their own saved games and earn their own in-game achievements.\nValve said a small scale trial of the sharing system would start in mid-September.\nSteam is one of the most popular platforms used by PC gamers to buy and access video games bought over the internet.\nValve uses it to promote its own titles as well as games written by third-party developers, from whom it takes a cut of the sales.\nBy introducing the sharing facility Valve may make its service appear more attractive than that of rivals such as Gog, Desura and Electronic Art's Origin.\nHowever, it could also impact sales if people who would otherwise have bought their own copy now decide to share someone else's.\nTo address this risk Valve will prevent more than one person being able to play the same purchase of a title at the same time.\nIndustry watchers say that if the move proves popular other online marketplaces may follow.\nIn an explanation, posted to the Steam website, Valve said free sharing would be enabled when someone authorises a computer to access their games.\nOther Steam members can request authorisation if they see that a friend or other family member owns a game they want to play.\nIf the owner of a game wants to play it while someone else is already using it, the person borrowing that game will be given a few minutes to either buy the game for themselves or have to quit.\nSharing will give people access to almost any game stored in a Steam account not just those titles made by Valve.\nHowever, Valve said not all games would be eligible for sharing because \"technical limitations\" - which might include separate subscriptions - might stop some being made available.\nValve spokeswoman Anna Sweet said the sharing service was launched in a direct response to user requests.\nValve is well known for video games such as Half Life, Left 4 Dead and Portal, but millions of gamers use its Steam service to buy and manage their library of games.\nSteam began as a way for people to manage games on PCs but Valve has been working to expand its reach.\nSteam has a Big Picture mode that makes it easier for games to be played on big screens.\nIn addition, it is known to be working on a Steam box, a console that gives people access to their account and lets them play games on a TV.\nRob Crossley, writing on the CVG games news site, said family sharing was \"likely to now be a key feature of the long-awaited Steam box\".\nAlso, he pointed out, the sharing idea was very similar to one Microsoft floated for its forthcoming Xbox One console.\nThe idea has now been withdrawn but Microsoft has hinted that it might return.", "The posters, designed to highlight a drop in the price of a four-pint bottle of milk, displayed pictures of a type of cattle used exclusively for meat.\nBut people with a beef have taken to the social-networking site Twitter to criticise the supermarket.\nA spokesman for Tesco said the adverts were being replaced.\nThe mistake was first spotted by farmers, who pointed out that the cows on show were a Hereford cross cow -

Ties have slowly been warming but it is clearly the successful conclusion of the nuclear accord with Iran that has paved the way for the embassy reopening.\nA number of other European countries have already sent ministers and trade delegations hotfoot to Tehran in the wake of the nuclear deal. Britain has to an extent lagged behind.\nThe hope though is that better diplomatic ties and stronger economic links might help to bolster more reform-minded elements in the Iranian leadership and open up Iranian society to new pressures for change.\nIn 2013, the UK and Iran both confirmed the appointment of non-resident charges d'affaires to act as heads of diplomatic affairs.\nThe reopening of the

communications and other equipment taken out when the post was abandoned.\nThe Home Office has also sought assurances over visa regulations amid fears that it would otherwise be unable to deal with Iranians who overstayed their right to be in the UK.\n\"While any visa service must operate within the framework of Iranian law, it must also meet broader UK immigration objectives,\" it said.\n\"A visa service is an important component of normal embassy business, but there are a number of outstanding issues that must be resolved.\"\nThe BBC's Kim Ghattas recently spent a week in Iran - the longest period a BBC correspondent has been granted permission to report there since 2009 - and interviewed the Vice-President Masumeh Ebtekar about the country's thawing relations with the West.\nMs Ebtekar said that Iran wanted to co-operate with neighbouring states to promote peace in the Middle East, and that while Iran had a right to defend itself it had no intention of dominating the region.", "The reform package for the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) also includes measures to protect endangered stocks, bring in more regional management and have more long-term planning.\nThe Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) welcomed the vote.\nFisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead also praised the move.\nBertie Armstrong, chief executive of the SFF, said: \"The current CFP is widely acknowledged as being badly over-centralised and failing to deliver effective fisheries management.\n\"We therefore welcome today's vote in the European Parliament, which is another step on the way to a new and reformed CFP.\n\"But it is important to remember that a final agreement has still to be reached among the European institutions, which is likely to take until at least the middle of the year.\"\nHe explained: \"In particular, we welcome the support for the decentralisation of fisheries management.\n\"Rather than a centralised 'one size fits all' policy, we now have a real opportunity to control our fisheries much more effectively on a regional basis where fishermen, government, scientists and other relevant stakeholders can develop effective management regimes.\n\"As far as discards are concerned, no-one hates discarding more than our fishermen but there is concern about how a discards ban would work in practice, given the complex mixed fisheries that our fishing fleet works in.\n\"There is still, therefore, much to discuss on the operational details of how such a plan would actually work.\"\nMr Lochhead said: \"Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was badly needed and long overdue so I am pleased that MEPs have voted through these proposals which will finally see an end to the wasteful practice of discarding.\n\"This vote is a key milestone and provides a sound basis for discussions with the Ministers in the coming weeks.\n\"I am looking forward to continuing to fight Scotland's corner at the fishing council in Europe later this month, especially in terms of ending micromanagement by Brussels of our seas.\n\"I am determined that we must not squander this once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure the reform that our fishing communities need if we are to ensure that both our marine environment and fishing industry can survive and thrive.\"\nMEP Struan Stevenson said: \"These reforms will wrestle control away from the micro-managers in Brussels who have made such an absolute mess of fisheries policy for the past 30 years.\n\"The vote today in Strasbourg was a seminal and long-overdue landmark on the road to reform of the CFP.\"\nHelen McLachlan, fisheries programme manager at WWF-UK said: \"This is a ground-breaking result for the future of fisheries across Europe and beyond.\n\"This vote reflects the views of the hundreds of thousands of members of the public, industry and fishermen themselves who campaigned to ensure the long term stability of fish stocks.\"\nHowever, a fishing alliance, Europeche, said the reforms were too sudden and too radical.\nThe MEPs voted for the package by 502 votes to 137.", "In the documents, Brown, 37, admits repeatedly abusing his ex-wife.\nThe Giants' decision came shortly after the player issued a statement insisting he had never hit her during the six-year period when he admits abuse.\nTeam president John Mara said the decision to retain him during the time since his arrest was \"misguided\".\n\"We believed we did the right thing at every juncture in our relationship with Josh,\" a statement added.\n\"We hope that Josh will continue to dedicate himself to rehabilitation, and to becoming a better person and father.\n\"We will continue to support him in his efforts to continue counselling, and we hope that Josh and his family can find peace and a positive

investigation led to a one-game ban in September of this year.\nThe NFL has said it will reopen its investigation following the release of the new documents.\nThe NFL has toughened its domestic violence policy following criticism when Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice received only a two-game suspension in July 2014 for assaulting his then fiancee, now his wife.\nHe was later banned indefinitely when a video emerged of him punching his fiancee in the face but won an appeal against the punishment.\nThe new rules could lead to a six-game suspension or a lifetime ban for a second offence.\n\"I am sorry that my past has called into question the character or integrity of The New York Giants, Mr Mara or any of those who have supported me along the way.\n\"I have taken measures to get help so that I may be the voice of change, not a statistic. It is important to share that I never struck my wife, and never would.\n\"Abuse takes many forms, and is not a gray area. Through the past several years I have worked to identify and rectify my own behaviors.\n\"The road to rehabilitation is a journey and a constant modification of a way of life. My journey will continue forever as a person determined to leave a positive legacy and I embrace the opportunities to show and speak about what has helped me to be that man.\n\"In the interim, I am cooperating with the Giants and the NFL.

The reason for the discrepancy was unclear.\nThe BBC's Mark Doyle, in the capital Abuja, says it appears some sort of negotiations will take place because of the large presence of international advisers in the country, including hostage negotiators.\nBoko Haram, whose name means \"Western education is forbidden\", had previously said the girls should not have been at school and should get married instead.\nThe militants have been engaged in a violent campaign against the Nigerian government since 2009.\nPresident Goodluck Jonathan - whose government has been heavily criticised for its response to the abduction - said on Sunday that help from abroad had made him optimistic of finding the girls.\nHe says he believes the girls are still in Nigeria.\nThe kidnapping has triggered a huge international campaign with world leaders and celebrities calling for the children to be released.\nThe UK, the US, France and China already have teams helping on the ground in Nigeria.

He made an imperious 215 in the victory at Lord's, but contributed four single-figure scores as Australia surrendered the Ashes in the successive three-day defeats at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge.\nHere he was back to his belligerent best, cutting and pulling regular boundaries against an England attack struggling to find consistent lines.\nHe added 146 with Adam Voges and 91 with Mitchell Starc, who scored an entertaining 58 at number nine to help Australia rally from 376-7 after two quick wickets from Moeen Ali before lunch.\nMoeen, Stokes and Finn all captured three wickets - with the latter collecting his 100th Test scalp when he dismissed Marsh.\nWith Australia seemingly set for a lead of more than 350 and rain forecast for Sunday, Clarke may consider changing the habit of a lifetime by enforcing the follow-on and raising the prospect of a three-day win. He has had the opportunity four times, and declined each time.\nRegardless of his decision, England's batting approach will require a sea change to give them any chance of avoiding ending the series in defeat.\nEngland pace bowler Steven Finn: We're disappointed, we've had a very, very poor day.

The animal is worshipped and decorated during festivals; holy men take around cows, with their foreheads smeared in vermillion, to seek alms.\nThere is even a journal called Indian Cow; and a Love 4 Cow Trust to \"propagate and promote love\" for cows. A right-wing Hindu organisation has actually launched cosmetics using cow urine and dung.\nThe cud-chewing, sedentary bovine also provides fodder for humour. A hugely popular - and possibly apocryphal - story relates to an essay on the animal by a civil service aspirant. \"The cow is a successful animal,\" it began. \"Also he is quadruped, and because he is female, he give milk, but will do so when he is got child. He is same like God, sacred to Hindus and useful to man. But he has got four legs together. Two are forward and two are afterwards.\"\nBut let's not digress.\nMore seriously, most states forbid cow slaughter, and the ban on beef has been criticised by many because the meat is cheaper than chicken and fish and is a staple for the poorer Muslim, tribal and dalit (formerly untouchable) communities.\nNot surprisingly, the cow is also India's most polarising - and political - animal.\nLast month, a 50-year-old man in northern Uttar Pradesh was killed in a mob lynching over rumours that his family had been storing and consuming beef at home. Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke his silence over the killing nearly two weeks later, members of his party thrashed an independent lawmaker in Kashmir for hosting a beef party.\nEarlier this month, Hindus and Muslims clashed over rumours, again, of cow slaughter in Uttar Pradesh. A row over banning beef is threatening to stoke religious tensions in restive Kashmir.\nWhile campaigning for his party in the crucial state elections in Bihar state, Mr Modi ridiculed a regional rival for saying many Hindus eat beef.\nThere are worrying reports that supporters of the BJP and right-wing Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the state have launched a virulent campaign against cow slaughter and beef.\nAlthough the government's own animal census shows that the cow and buffalo population has grown - a 6.75% increase between 2007 and 2012 -  and cow slaughter is banned in most states, there is hysteria being whipped up that the bovine is under threat.\nVigilante cow protection groups have mushroomed. They claim to have a strong network of informers and say they \"feel empowered\" because of the ruling Hindu nationalist BJP government in Delhi. One of these groups actually managed to get a court order against a beef and pork festival at a Delhi university in 2012.\nThat's not all. The BJP-ruled state of Rajasthan has a cow minister. There are campaigns going on demanding that the cow should replace the tiger as the national animal - a minister in Haryana, also ruled by the BJP, promptly began an online poll.\nMr Modi must partly share the blame for whipping up the unfounded and perilous frenzy over cow slaughter. On the general election campaign trail last year, he accused the Congress government of promoting a \"pink revolution\" - slaughtering cows and exporting meat for money. \"Should we feel proud of this endeavour of the UPA government led by Congress, which is founded on the killing of our mother cow?\" he wrote in a blog in 2012. It's another matter that under Mr Modi, India continues to be the world's largest exporter of beef - 80% of it buffalo meat.\nBut historian Mukul Kesavan sees one argument offered for cow protection as \"just a belligerent assertion\".\n\"It goes like this: I am a Hindu, the cow is my mother, and I won't have her killed. What's being invoked here isn't morality or sentimentality or chivalry or economics: this is an assertion of fictive kinship that effectively argues that all cows are Hindu women.\"\nThis is not the first time the cow has become mixed up with politics.\nThe first organised Hindu cow protection movement was launched by a Sikh sect in Punjab in about 1870. In 1882, Hindu religious leader Dayananda Saraswati founded the first cow protection committee. \"It made the animal a symbol of the unity of a wide-ranging people, challenged the Muslim practice of its slaughter and provoked a series of serious communal riots in the 1880s and 1890s,\" says historian DN Jha.\nConflicts over cow slaughter often sparked religious riots that led to the killing of more than 100 people in 1893 alone. In 1966, at least eight people died in riots outside the parliament in Delhi while demanding a national ban on cow slaughter. And in 1979, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, considered by many as a spiritual heir of Mahatma Gandhi, went on a hunger strike to ban cow slaughter.\nThe \"holiness of the cow\" is also a myth, argues Dr Jha. In his masterly work The Myth of the Holy Cow, Dr Jha cites religious scriptures and ancient texts to show that Hindus did consume beef in ancient India. This flew against the Hindu right-wing assertion that beef-eating arrived in India with the coming of Islam. (Not surprisingly, he was threatened after the book was published in India.)\nAnd American academic Wendy Doniger correctly argues that Hindus \"do not always treat cows with respect or kindness; cows are sometimes beaten and frequently half starved\".\nIndia's most revered leader Mahatma Gandhi may also have been responsible for the Hindu veneration of the cow. He once said that the \"central fact of Hinduism is cow protection\", and spoke about the \"idea of penance and self-sacrifice for the martyred innocence\" it embodied. Today, in an ironical twist, the Hindu radicals seem to have hijacked the cow, and all it stands for.", "Captain Jeff Davis, a spokesman, said 10 operatives were killed in a single strike on 3 February.\nA second strike on 4 February killed Abu Hani al-Masri, who had close ties to the late al-Qaeda leader, he said.\nAl-Masri is said to have set up and run al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan during the 1980s and 1990s.\nHe also had close ties to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who became the leader of al-Qaeda when Bin Laden was killed by US forces in 2011.\n\"These strikes disrupt al-Qaeda's ability to plot and direct external attacks targeting the US and our interests worldwide,\" said Capt Davis.\nAl-Qaeda's influence in Syria operates largely through an affiliate jihadist group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.\nThe group announced in mid-2016 that it was no longer affiliated with any external group, prompting  speculation that it had cut ties with al-Qaeda, although the latter group was not mentioned by name.\nIt is thought that the leadership structure of Fateh al-Sham is still intertwined with al-Qaeda.\nA US operation against al-Qaeda in Yemen last week - the first military action authorised by new president Donald Trump - resulted in the death of a Navy Seal and up to 16 civilians, including children, according to reports.\nMr Trump's administration declared the operation a success, saying it had yielded valuable intelligence.", "The Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 57.3 from 54.2 in March, well above economists' expectations.\nA reading above 50 indicates growth.\nMarkit said the sector enjoyed \"solid improvement\" last month, with new orders being received at the fastest rate since January 2014.\nThe survey found the main source of new work came from the domestic market, but there was a \"solid increase in new export business\" due to a combination of better global economic conditions and the weakening of the pound.\nThe fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June has made UK goods cheaper for foreign buyers, but has also pushed up the cost of imports for UK companies.\nMarkit said price pressures faced by manufacturers remained \"elevated\", but noted that input cost inflation had \"eased significantly\" since January.\n\"Although only accounting for 10% of the economy, the upturn in the manufacturing sector represents some welcome good news after the sharp slowing in GDP seen in the first quarter,\" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at INS Markit.\n\"The big question is whether this growth spurt can be maintained, especially given the backdrop of ongoing market volatility and a number of political headwinds such as elections at home and abroad.\n\"Other surges seen since the middle of last year have generally proved short-lived, as weak wage growth sapped consumer spending.\"\nOfficial figures from the Office for National Statistics last week indicated that the UK economy grew by just 0.3% in the first three months of the year, the slowest rate since the first quarter of 2016.", "He extended the offer in a phone call on Friday with the Palestinian Authority president, their first contact since Mr Trump took office.\nMr Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February.\nAt that meeting, Mr Trump dropped a long-standing US commitment to a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nA \"two-state solution\" to the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is the declared goal of their leaders and the international community.\nIt is shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent state of Palestine within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel.\nThe UN, the Arab League, the European Union, Russia and, until now, the US routinely restate their commitment to the concept.\nThe policy shift fuelled Palestinian concerns that Washington was becoming even more pro-Israeli under the Trump administration.\nThere have been no substantive peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians since US-mediated negotiations broke down in April 2014.\nMr Trump's spokesman, Sean Spicer, confirmed on Friday that the US president had invited Mr Abbas to the White House \"very soon\".\nThe president told the Palestinian leader they would discuss how to rekindle peace talks, Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.\nHe said Mr Trump had stressed \"his commitment to a peace process that will lead to a real peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis\".\nPalestinian officials had indicated before Friday's call that Mr Abbas would press the US president about Israeli settlement-building on occupied land and the importance of a two-state solution.\nDuring last month's joint press conference, Mr Trump asked Mr Netanyahu to \"hold back on settlements for a little bit\", appearing to catch the Israeli leader unawares.\nThe US Senate on Thursday approved Mr Trump's controversial nominee for ambassador to Israel.\nDavid Friedman favours relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem, a highly inflammatory proposal because both Israel and the Palestinians lay claim to the city as their capital.\nThe US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, met the Palestinian envoy to the UN, Riyad Mansour, for the first time on Tuesday.\nShe tweeted afterwards that the Palestinians should \"meet with Israel in direct negotiations rather than looking to the UN to deliver results\".", "There is a heated debate now about the police tactics, as some 6,000 Hamburg residents clean up after the riots.\nSome in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party say Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz should quit.\nLeft-wing extremists of the so-called Black Bloc are under intense scrutiny.\nGermany has had previous experience in tackling the violent protesters who try to disrupt international summits.\nThe Hamburg authorities deployed about 20,000 police to keep protesters away from the G20 venue.\nMr Scholz and his Social Democrat (SPD) allies argue that the police did their main job effectively - protecting the G20.\nBut a minority of anti-G20 protesters - more or less affiliated to the Black Bloc - engaged in running battles with police in the streets.\nViolence was predictable after the leftist militants invited in sympathisers from across Europe with the slogan \"Welcome to Hell\".\nThe flashpoint was an authorised demonstration by about 12,000 people on Thursday evening. Violence erupted when police tried to isolate Black Bloc militants who refused to remove their masks, defying the law.\nPolice had earlier banned an overnight protest camp in the city - yet the right to peaceful assembly is enshrined in German law.\nCornered by police, the violent minority, numbering about 1,000 and clad in black, hurled bottles and chunks of paving stone. Some protesters scaled a wall and rained fireworks down on the police.\nOfficers in full riot gear retaliated with baton charges, tear gas and water cannon. An anti-terrorist unit was called in to help disperse the Black Bloc. There were 186 arrests.\nThe worst of the violence gripped the central Schanzen district. It is an area famous for its left-wing \"alternative\" scene, including squatters at the Rote Flora cultural centre.\nClashes continued throughout the G20 summit - until Sunday morning.

But he admitted that police could only arrest \"those who we know are up to no good\".\nGreen Party leader Simone Peter warned against a \"populist, knee-jerk\" reaction. She pointed to the EU's existing intelligence database - the Schengen Information System (SIS) - and said police forces ought to use it more efficiently.\nSome of Mrs Merkel's conservative allies accuse the SPD, Greens and left-wing Die Linke of turning a blind eye to far-left extremists.\nBut Die Linke has called for a parliamentary inquiry into the G20 violence.\nFor a long time the authorities' focus has been on Islamist violence and neo-Nazi extremists. Intelligence on those extremists is shared via an EU database, but sometimes police co-operation is patchy.\nMrs Merkel's chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, has defended the Hamburg mayor, saying police tactics were agreed between the city and the federal government.\nThe government has offered compensation to businesses that were vandalised - a process that could take many weeks.\nThe police are struggling to identify instigators of the violence. They have asked the public to hand in video or photos taken on mobile phones that could help the investigation.\nMasked protesters dressed from head to toe in black were almost impossible to identify. Some avoided arrest by changing quickly, as they wore everyday clothes underneath, German n-tv news reported.\nGermany's second-biggest city is licking its wounds and the scale of the violence has triggered much soul-searching.\nMrs Merkel defended the choice of Hamburg for the G20, pointing to previous summits held in London and other major cities.\nThere is a powerful argument against removing such summits to isolated venues that are easier to protect. Doing so risks fuelling hostility towards a perceived global elite, widely accused of encouraging predatory capitalism and deepening poverty.\nInterior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said Germany would continue hosting summits in cities, despite the shock over Hamburg.\nThere is some frustration that the clashes overshadowed the important messages that peaceful demonstrators wanted the world to hear.\nSome commentators say society as a whole has a responsibility to stand up for democracy and prevent a violent minority foisting their agenda on others.", "More than 1,000 people have died in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria since the outbreak was first reported in February.\nMiguel Pajares, 75, was airlifted back to Spain from Liberia last week with a nun who tested negative for the virus.\nFor the past few days he had been treated with an untested, experimental drug, Zmapp.\nA World Health Organization (WHO) panel in Geneva has meanwhile approved the ethics of using ZMapp.\nAccording to the Reuters news agency, the panel said it was ethical to combat the Ebola outbreak by offering drugs or vaccines whose side-effects and efficacy had yet to be proven.\nThe priest was part of a Catholic order at St Joseph's hospital in the Liberian capital, Monrovia.\nThe hospital has now been closed because of the outbreak.\nA Congolese nun died there on Saturday, days after its director, Patrick Nshamdze, also died.", "The 34-year-old has made 484 league appearances, including spells at Norwich, Swindon and Colchester.\nManager Jim Bentley told the club website: \"His vast experience will be vital for us this season.

It also provoked doubts about its legality. Given the potential international ramifications, it's highly unlikely British police will storm into the ground-floor mission.\nBut neither is it likely that Britain or Sweden will give the guarantees that Ecuador and Mr Assange want - that he won't face onward extradition to the US.\nSo for now the stalemate continues.  Police are posted at both the front and back of the Ecuadorean embassy to ensure Julian Assange doesn't escape - and Britain is faced with a costly security operation.\nThe US is carrying out an investigation into Wikileaks, which has published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables, embarrassing several governments and international businesses.\nAlleged Wikileaks source Bradley Manning, 24, an intelligence analyst in the American army who served in Iraq, is alleged to have leaked US government cables to the whistle-blowing website. He is set to face a court martial.\nIn an interview for US television in 2010, Mr Assange denied any knowledge of Pte Manning.\nMr Assange began his speech by thanking his supporters, many of whom have been holding a vigil outside the building in Knightsbridge.\nSpeaking of the visit by police officers to the embassy on Wednesday, Mr Assange said: \"Inside this embassy after dark, I could hear teams of police swarming up into the building through its internal fire escape. But I knew there would be witnesses and that is because of you.\n\"If the UK did not throw away the Vienna Conventions the other night it is because the world was watching and the world was watching because you were watching.\"\nIt is an established international convention that local police and security forces are not permitted to enter an embassy, unless they have the express permission of the ambassador.\nThe Foreign Office has said it remained committed to reaching a \"negotiated solution\" but following its obligations under the Extradition Act, it would arrest Mr Assange if he left the embassy.\nIn 2010, two female Wikileaks supporters accused Mr Assange, an Australian citizen, of committing sexual offences against them while he was in Stockholm to give a lecture.\nMr Assange claims the sex was consensual and the allegations are politically motivated.\nIn a statement issued after the Ecuadorean decision to grant Mr Assange political asylum, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the UK was under a \"binding obligation\" to extradite him to Sweden.\nMr Assange entered the embassy after the UK's Supreme Court dismissed his bid to reopen his appeal against extradition and gave him a two-week grace period before extradition proceedings could start.\nEcuador's president Rafael Correa has suggested Mr Assange could co-operate with Sweden if assurances are given that there would be no extradition to a third country.\nMr Assange's balcony appearance occurred as foreign ministers from the Union of South American Nations were gathering in Ecuador's second city, Guayaquil, to discuss the diplomatic situation caused by the asylum decision.\nShortly before Mr Assange delivered his speech, his legal adviser Baltasar Garzon said the Australian had told lawyers to carry out \"a legal action\" protecting \"the rights of Wikileaks [and] Julian himself\".\nMr Garzon, a former judge, did not give specific details of the action but said it would also extend to \"all those currently being investigated\".\nBarrister and former government lawyer, Carl Gardner, said Mr Assange's options were now severely limited.\n\"There's no legal action he can take now.

The curator of its museum, Adam Chadwick, said: \"Was Bodyline unsportsmanlike? By the standards of the day, yes. By the standards of now, it was a stroke of genius.\"\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, the MCC - Marylebone Cricket Club - still ruled the cricketing world from its seat at Lord's in London.\nBut it had a problem, in the shape of batting phenomenon Don Bradman.\nDuring their 1930 tour of England, Australia - the arch rivals - had dominated the home bowlers, with Bradman averaging a staggering 139.14.\nThe MCC looked to austere amateur player Douglas Jardine for an answer, making him England captain.\nJardine believed Bradman struggled against balls which bounced into his chest and formed a tactic to exploit this. But the plan needed the right bowler, and that bowler was former Nottinghamshire miner Harold Larwood.\nDuncan Hamilton, Larwood's biographer, said: \"He had two things. Firstly he was incredibly accurate, he claimed never to have bowled a wide in his career, and accuracy was essential to Bodyline.\n\"Secondly he was devastatingly fast. All his contemporaries said he was the quickest they had faced. At certain times during that series he must have got close to, if not passed, the 100mph (160km/h) mark.\n\"Every fast bowler who sees that old footage says, 'Wow, that's quick!'.\"\nJardine's plan was to use what was known in England as leg theory. Bowling fast, high-bouncing deliveries on the line of the leg stump of the wicket - where a batsman would usually stand.\nThe batsman had three choices: to move but risk exposing his wicket, to play the ball with his bat and face being caught by a ring of close fielders, or try to duck and risk painful blows.\nThe tour began in earnest at Sydney in December 1932, ironically without Bradman playing. Bodyline brought England victory.\nBy Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent\nBodyline introduced a previously unspoken element into Test cricket - namely the physical intimidation of the batsman.\nThe placement of fielders, deliberately positioned to catch the ball from batsmen protecting themselves from short, fast deliveries aimed at the ribs and throat, was entirely legal at the time, but seriously threatened the code of sportsmanship that is so central to cricket.\nThat said, the Australian administrators - who made such a meal of Jardine's tactic at the time - were noticeably quiet when their own fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were terrifying batsmen with short-pitched bowling in the 1970s.\nThe authorities acted swiftly after the Bodyline tour to limit the placing of fielders in catching positions on the leg side in an attempt to deter a repeat of the tactic, and also brought in a restriction of the number of bouncers that can be bowled in a single over.\nBut after Lillee and Thomson, the West Indies' formidable pace attack of the late 1970s and 80s also proved that skilful, intimidatory fast bowling is every bit as effective as Bodyline, even with field restrictions and after the introduction of helmets.\nComplaints about the tactic quickly appeared. As the bruises and wickets mounted, the disquiet turned to anger, with claims batsmen were being physically targeted.\nDespite Australia levelling the series at the second match in Melbourne, the repeated blows to lightly protected players attracted outraged headlines.\nSome batsmen endured hours of punishment and even Bradman looked unsettled.\nMr Studham said: \"The tactics employed by Jardine roused intense passions, as they were so out of accord with anything that had previously happened on the cricket field.\n\"Targeting the bowling along the line of the batsman's body was regarded by the Australian crowds as vicious, unsporting and especially after repeatedly battering the batsmen, 'hitting a man when he was down and certainly no part of cricket'.\"\nWith everything to play for, and feelings running at fever pitch, the Adelaide match opened in front of packed stands.\nCricket bible Wisden would later call it \"probably the most unpleasant Test ever played\".\nAustralian captain Bill Woodfull was left staggering after being struck just above the heart by Larwood.\nThe booing lasted for three minutes, despite the fact England had not yet deployed Bodyline tactics in the match.\nThat would change though, moments later, when Jardine called out to Larwood: \"Well bowled Harold,\" and set the fielders in the hated Bodyline formation. Police had to be deployed on the boundary.\nThe next day, Oldfield had his skull cracked and Larwood had to be escorted from the ground.\nSource: BBC Religion & Ethics\nIs fair play important in sport?\nThe line between gamesmanship and cheating\nCan cricket teach children fair play?\nIt was almost inevitable the problems would overflow from the playing field. But no-one could have predicted it would lead to three events then unthinkable in cricket.\nMCC tour manager Pelham Warner, seeking to smooth relationships, was sent packing by the normally placid Woodfull with what were, for some years, the 25 most famous words in sport.\n\"I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not.\"\nThe comment, made in the previously sacrosanct dressing room, was then leaked to the press.\nThe next day, Australian Board of Control for International Cricket sent a cable to the MCC which described England's tactics as \"unsportsmanlike\", the ultimate taboo for guardians of the game.\nMr Chadwick said: \"The MCC reacted with incredulity to the Australian messages that the tactics were unsportsmanlike and they felt it was really out of the question that an MCC team led by a gentleman of Douglas Jardine's character could possibly behave in such a manner.\n\"The archives really do show the feeling was 'Oh, the Australians are being a bit hysterical about it'.\"\nBut the situation spiralled. Jardine threatened to withdraw his team from the remaining two matches unless the allegation was retracted.\nStoked by newspaper reports, each country backed its own players.\nThe standoff only ended when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons told the cricket board a British boycott of Australian goods could cripple the country.\nEngland won the series 4-1. Bradman's batting average was cut to a merely excellent 56. But the shock lasted for years.\nMr Studham said he felt Bodyline was one of those sporting \"rite of passage\" stories all Australian children learn about.\n\"The on-field tactics and resulting carnage at the third Test in Adelaide split already strained relations between the teams, the game's governing authorities, and even threatened to split the governments.\n\"While perfectly legal at the time, it left lasting ill-feeling in Australia where it was seen to be outside the spirit of the game.\n\"The fact that a few years later the laws of cricket were amended to ban Bodyline bowling contributed greatly to its continuing national disdain.\"\nMr Chadwick said: \"The MCC did not have any advance warning of the tactics which Jardine was using and wasn't really aware of the impact - all they were getting was newspaper reports and telegraph messages of the score.\n\"When they saw it for themselves they realised this really wasn't the sort of cricket they had always set themselves up to promote as containing the best values of Britishness and gentlemanly fair play.\"\nJardine retired from first class cricket the following year. Larwood's agony was more extended.\nInjured through over-bowling, he was then stunned at his treatment by cricket's hierarchy.\nMr Hamilton said: \"He was totally betrayed by the establishment. They treated him like toxic waste.\n\"He was asked to apologise and he rightly refused, saying he had done what his captain had asked. He got no support for his injury.\n\"On his return to Nottingham he was met by cheering crowds 10,000-strong. He went from that to being vilified. The whole thing was a tragedy.\"\nLarwood never played for England again. On the advice of some of his old Bodyline foes, he emigrated to Australia in 1950 - becoming firm friends with Bert Oldfield.\nHe was appointed MBE in 1993, at the age of 88. A statue of him was unveiled in Kirkby-in-Ashfield, close to his birthplace, in 2002.", "The 20-year-old, the youngest prop to play for Scotland in half a century, won his first cap as a replacement in the Six Nations against England.\n\"I love the club and I feel we're going places,\" he told the Warriors website.\n\"The club and [coach] Gregor (Townsend) have showed a lot of faith in me and I want to repay them for that.

More details of the Scottish results will be released next year.\nThe first release of the data showed population estimates by sex and five-year age bands, as well as the total population estimates for each council area in Scotland.\nThe figures showed that the Scottish population was made up of 2,728,000 women and 2,567,000 men.\nFor the first time ever, the number of people aged 65 and over was higher than the number aged under 15. The number of over-65s has increased by 85,000 (11%) since 2001, and now represents some 17% of the total population.\nThere were 230,000 people aged 80 and over in 2011, an increase of 19% on the figure of 193,000 in 2001.\nIn contrast, there has been a decrease of 69,000 (11%) in the number of children aged between five and 14 over the past decade.\nHowever, in 2011 there were 293,000 children aged under five, an increase of 6% from 2001.\nOver the past century, the age profile of the population has become much older, with the proportion aged under 15 falling from 32% in 1911 to 16% last year, while the proportion aged 65 and over has increased from 5% to 17%.\nThe Scottish population had been falling steadily from a peak of 5,227,000 in the mid-1970s to 5,055,000 in 2002, but has been rising since.\nThe total Scottish population was just over half a million higher in 2011 than it was 100 years earlier.\nThere are also huge differences in population density across the country, with the population per square kilometre ranging from nine in Eilean Siar (the Western Isles) and the Highlands to 3,395 in Glasgow.\nCommenting on the results, Acting Registrar General Audrey Robertson said: \"These first results from the Census confirm the upward trend in the size of Scotland's population in recent years.\n\"At 5,295,000, the population is now the highest ever recorded.

A recent survey, for instance, has Mr Trump faring poorly against Democrat Hillary Clinton compared to his Republican rivals. And yet, according to another poll, the candidate has opened a massive lead over his competition.\nSo as Republican candidates gather in Las Vegas on Tuesday for the party's last presidential debate of 2015, they're faced with an overriding question. What's the best way to beat the brash billionaire before it's too late?\nHere are five possible strategies.\nIt may be hard to remember, but it was once thought that best way to defeat Mr Trump was  to pretend he wasn't there. In the first Republican debate, back in August, candidates like former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker effectively screwed their eyes shut and plugged their ears whenever he spoke.\nThe result was that Mr Trump ploughed through them, making the candidates seem weak and irrelevant. Mr Walker's campaign is now a historical footnote, and Mr Bush is languishing in single digits.\nSome Republican presidential hopefuls may continue to talk over, under and around Mr Trump, but they do so at their peril.\nLike a mythical beast of old, The Donald has been the undoing of many candidates who have sought to test their mettle against the front-runner.\nTexas Governor Rick Perry? Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal? They charged headfirst into the Trump buzzsaw and are now licking their wounds at home. Ohio Governor John Kasich made a run at the real-estate mogul during the last debate and was cut to ribbons.\nGiven the level of outrage that Mr Trump's Muslim border ban generated last week, however, some candidates may figure the time is ripe for another frontal assault.\nA \"have you no decency\" style soliloquy could be just the trick for candidates like Mr Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie or Florida Senator Marco Rubio, looking to rally the anti-Trump forces to their banner.\nOr it could end in disaster, as Mr Trump once again gives better than he gets.\nIf Mr Trump is a classic bully, as his detractors often say, what better way to defeat him than with humourous derision? Take away a bully's ability to intimidate and demean, and he loses his power.\nIt's a lesson that Mr Kasich's team has perhaps learned. After the candidate's ill-fated debate fireworks and a television advertising campaign questioning Mr Trump's fitness to lead, a super-PAC supporting the Ohio governor is now running a 75-second video that ridicules the New Yorker as a failed steak huckster.\nWhen Mr Trump called Ted Cruz a maniac this weekend, the Texas senator responded by tweeting a video of a song by the same name from the 1980s film Flashdance.\nNeedling like this could prompt an angry response from Mr Trump, of course. But when the New Yorker hits back against attacks, he looks strong. If he punches back against humour, he could look small and thin-skinned.\nA much-anticipated poll released on Sunday showed that Mr Cruz has vaulted ahead of Mr Trump as the top preference of likely Republican participants in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucus. The Texan has done so by deliberately avoiding any conflict with Mr Trump, direct or otherwise.\nMr Cruz was surreptitiously recorded explaining his strategy during a closed-door meeting with deep-pocketed donors in New York last week. He said he planned to \"bear hug\" Trump and fellow outsider Ben Carson and \"smother them with love\", then collect their supporters when they eventually begin looking for a more serious, electable candidate.\nMr Cruz will likely stay the course on Tuesday night, and other candidates, seeing his success, may follow his lead - or even direct their fire at the new hot hand.\nMr Carson already is on the record saying he'll stand with Mr Trump if the Republican establishment tries an end run around the nomination rules to block one of them from winning.\nPerhaps the way Mr Trump loses is for other candidates to act just like him.\nThen again, that sounds a lot like a way Mr Trump wins.", "Spelthorne Borough Council said using the cameras could deter aggressive acts, or verbal and physical abuse.\nThe plan is to have a more \"imposing\" recording system to address high levels of anti-social behaviour, the council said.\nUnder the plans, the technology will also be given to parking officers.\nAnd in the future, cameras could also be worn by officers from other departments.\nThe council said cameras would be able to capture images close up, record audio, allow an officer to have their hands free while recording an incident, and provide evidence for dealing with investigations.\nCameras would also help with investigating claims of inappropriate conduct by officers, the council added.\nConsultation on the move runs until 9 July.", "The Local Government Association wants councils to be given control of careers advice to ensure teenagers \"pursue the right course for them\".\nA report for the LGA suggests the teenage dropout rate costs the country \u00c2\u00a3814m a year.\nThe government said its reforms were ensuring teenagers gained vital skills.\nThe LGA commissioned the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion to analyse the latest figures which were for the year 2012-13.\nThe researchers combined dropout and failure figures on A-levels, apprenticeships and further education courses to give a total of 178,000 16 to 18-year-olds not completing their courses.\nOf these, 92,000 students withdrew from schools, primarily from AS and A-levels; 24,200 did not complete apprenticeships or training courses and an estimated 61,900 withdrew from FE courses.\nThe teenagers at greatest risk of dropping out were apprentices, with a quarter not finishing, suggest the figures.\nThe authors note success rates both for AS and A-levels and FE courses have improved in recent years, with 16% of students dropping out of further education, 9% from individual AS-levels and 5% from individual A-levels.\nThis has contributed to a long-term fall in the total number of drop-outs, of 30% since 2006-7, they add.\nDespite this they calculate 12% of all government spending on post-16 education and skills goes on \"uncompleted\" courses.\n\"For the young person it means coping with uncertainty and a sense of failure and with hard decisions about what to do next.\n\"For schools, the exchequer and the taxpayer there is the cost of providing education that does not result in a positive outcome.\"\nThe LGA says the current centralised approach to post-16 education does not allow schools and colleges to help teenagers find the right courses.\n\"Local councils, colleges, schools and employers know how to best help their young people and should have devolved funding and powers to work together to give young people the best chance of building careers  and taking jobs that exist locally,\" said Cllr David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's children and young people board.\nThe Association of Colleges said the reasons for young people not finishing their courses were \"complex\".\n\"Sometimes they get a job and therefore leave education,\" said AoC chief executive Martin Doel, but he agreed poor careers advice was a problem.\n\"This report shines a light on failing careers advice in this country.\n\"We would like to see the establishment of careers hubs in every local area supported by schools, colleges, universities, local councils, employers and Jobcentre Plus to ensure everyone has access to the high-quality impartial advice they deserve.\"\nThe government said its new independent careers and enterprise company would boost collaboration between schools and employers and give young people access to high quality advice and opportunities.\n\"We are reforming academic qualifications and vocational education to ensure young people get the knowledge and skills that they need to move into a job, apprenticeship or to continue their education,\" said a Department for Education spokesman.\nThe spokesman said the government had ring-fenced \u00c2\u00a37.2bn to ensure an education or training place for all under-18s, adding that the number of young people not in education, employment or training was at its lowest recorded level.", "1908 - King Carlos and eldest son assassinated in Lisbon.

An official investigator has said there is no evidence she burned the Koran.\nThere have been mixed reactions among the Afghan public following the court's decision.\nSome have welcomed it and say Farkhunda's family have finally been given justice.\nHowever, the Afghan judicial system is widely seen as corrupt and many others have criticised the court's proceedings.\nKangaroo courts are common across the country, especially in areas where the government does not have full control and where tribal elders and local strongmen act as a self-appointed judiciary.\nEven in the cities where people can resort to the courts, cases can face long delays and corruption is chronic. The police force is more focused on fighting an insurgency than upholding the rule of law.\nThe trial today may provide some justice for Farkhunda but it does not reflect the reality of efforts to counter crime and violence across Afghanistan.\nViolence against women, and violence in general, are common in a country that has been at war for over three decades.\nBut even against that backdrop, the attack on Farkhunda on 19 March shocked many Afghans, taking place as it did in the heart of the capital and under the eyes of the police.\nFarkhunda was beaten to death before her body was driven over by a car, dragged through the streets and then set on fire.\nSome of the attackers recorded the brutal killing on their cell phones and footage was later uploaded to social media sites, including some that appeared to show a policeman taking part in the attack and pushing Farkhunda onto a roof.\nCorrespondents say that had it not been for the videos and the nature of the incident, it would have gone unnoticed like hundreds of similar cases, especially in rural areas, many of which never make it to court at all.\nThe case is not the first where the justice system has rapidly handed down death sentences for a high-profile crime - in October five men were hanged for a gang rape in Paghman district.\nIn that case, as in the current trial, there were concerns from rights activists over the speed and fairness of the convictions.", "The 21-year-old has been at Chelsea since she was nine and spent last season on loan with Women's Super League 2 side Bristol City.\n\"I know a few of the girls already from playing with England and I have met a few of them as well.

Its chairman is former BBC Wales controller Geraint Talfan Davies.\nVote Leave has the backing of anti-EU Conservatives, those in Labour who want to see a Leave vote and UKIP.\nIt also has a Welsh campaign - Vote Leave Cymru - which is being led by former Welsh Secretary David Jones.\nWelsh Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also mounting their own Remain campaigns as individual parties.\nUKIP's main focus has always been to get Britain out of the EU, and is campaigning for Leave. Party leader Nigel Farage has backed the Grassroots Out effort, which failed to get designation as the official Leave campaign but is continuing to operate.\nLeaders of Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru, Carwyn Jones and Leanne Wood, are prominent Welsh Remain campaigners, as is former Welsh Liberal Democrat leader and sole Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams.\nUKIP group leader Neil Hamilton and UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill will be vocal campaigners on the Leave side, and Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has said he will be backing Leave as well.\nThe big messages from the different campaigns are the same in London as they are in Cardiff. But three big flashpoints are the focus of many of the specific Welsh arguments over the EU.\nThe future of the steel industry and the EU's role in it has proved highly controversial, driven by massive job losses and a decision by Tata Steel - owner of the Port Talbot steelworks - to sell its business.\nLeave campaigners say governments in the UK have been limited by what they can do because of EU rules restricting state aid, and have been unable to set tariffs to protect Welsh and UK business from cheap Chinese steel.\nThose on the Remain side argue the EU already has a large number of anti-dumping measures in place, and the UK government is able to act on energy prices and business rates to cut costs for the steel industry. There is more on the steel debate here.\nAnother big point of contention has been the structural funds Wales receives - cash given to poorer parts of the union to help boost economic growth.\nUnder the current EU scheme, Wales is pegged to receive \u00c2\u00a31.8bn from 2014 to 2020.\nMost of it is spent in the west Wales and valleys region, which covers the whole of Wales excluding Powys, Monmouthshire, Newport, the Vale of Glamorgan, Flintshire, Wrexham and Cardiff.\nBack in February, Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK government could not guarantee making up any shortfall in the EU aid Wales receives if Britain was to leave the bloc.\nBut UK government employment minister Priti Patel has countered that, saying the funds may end anyway after 2020 even if there was no Brexit.\nMeanwhile Wales' share of the pot of money spent by the EU on farming has also been subject to debate.\nUnder the current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) scheme for 2014-2020, Wales receives around \u00c2\u00a3200m a year.\nFirst Minister Carwyn Jones has warned farming in Wales would \"come effectively to an end\" with the loss of EU subsidies.\nBut Leave campaigners argue agriculture would be better off out of the EU, saying CAP is extremely bureaucratic, and levels of government support to British farming would be unaffected and could actually rise in the event of Brexit.\nBritish or Irish citizens aged 18 or over and who are living in the UK are eligible to take part in the referendum.\nCommonwealth citizens who are permitted to live in the UK can also take part, as can British citizens who live overseas but have been registered to vote in the UK for the last 15 years.\nUnless you arrange for a postal or proxy vote, you will need to go to a polling station. This will be listed on the polling card you get sent before referendum day.\nUnlike the Welsh Assembly election there are no multiple ballot papers to worry about - there is just one question, with two answers to choose from.\nThe question is: \"Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\"\nIt is a referendum - you place one cross in the box next to whichever choice you wish to back.\nStations will be open from 07:00 to 22:00 BST on 23 June.\nThe counts will begin immediately at the close of poll.\nLocal counts will take place in every one of the 22 council areas in the country, and results will be fed back to Connah's Quay in Flintshire, which will act as the regional centre co-ordinating the result in Wales.\nThere will be a local result produced at every local count, and a Wales national result as well.\nBut it will be the figure for the United Kingdom that will determine the result of the referendum.\nYou will be able to follow the results on the BBC website, and on TV, radio and social media.\nIf you took part in the Welsh Assembly election you should be registered to vote already.

'I'll never let you do that. I'll never do that.'\"\n\"Steve only yelled at me four or five times during the 13 years I knew him, and this was one of them,\" Mr Cook added.\nMr Jobs did go on to have a liver transplant, in March 2009.\nHe resigned as Apple chief executive in August 2011 and died in October at the age of 56.\nThe book also reveals that Mr Jobs contemplated buying Yahoo as a way for Apple to get into the search business.\nBut parts of it contradict an earlier biography written by Walter Isaacson. In that book Mr Isaacson claims that Apple was contemplating creating a television - but according to Becoming Steve Jobs, the Apple founder had little interest in this.\nHe tells Apple designer Jony Ive in the book: \"I just don't like television. Apple will never make a TV again.\"", "The move, to be confirmed by Scottish government ministers, is supported by opposition parties.\nThe announcement is expected to confirm a timetable, although the precise terms of reference have yet to be drawn up.\nThe move follows a number of scandals involving the abuse of children in care, including at institutions run by the Roman Catholic church.\nBBC Scotland's home affairs correspondent Reevel Alderson said: \"It is no secret that the Scottish government favours holding an inquiry into allegations of sexual abuse involving children.\n\"There's support from opposition parties too. It follows the scandal surrounding schools run by the Roman Catholic Church and other care institutions.\n\"But so far ministers haven't committed themselves to a timetable.\"\nLater this week they will announce their intention to hold an inquiry, although it will only take place after the terms of reference can be worked out.\nThis will include setting out the types of abuse which can be investigated, as well as the remedies Holyrood could put in place for those who have survived childhood sexual abuse.\nAlan Draper, an academic who compiled a report for the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland on how to deal with historical child abuse, said he anticipated that this could be a \"momentous week\".\nHe said: \"Clearly we have been fighting for decades and what we require is a full public inquiry preferably led by a judge with statutory powers, that's absolutely essential.\"\nMr Draper said he hoped the inquiry would bring a \"cascade of change\" and begin to reform the law so that abuse survivors would not be prevented from seeking justice.\nHe said he hoped the time bar that stopped historical cases coming to court would be set aside.\nMr Draper added: \"Also I hope they'll talk about a redress scheme for survivors so we can begin to repair the damage that's been caused to so many.\"\nThe campaigner said he hoped the inquiry would \"engage fully with survivors\" about the remit and membership \"to avoid the chaos that's been caused down south\".\nFrank Docherty, the founder and honorary chairman of Incas (In-care Abuse Survivors), said: \"We've waited 15 years and what we want is a full public inquiry into all the abuse, in all the institutions in Scotland.\"\nIncas vice chairman Frank McCue, himself an abuse survivor, said: \"The length of time these people have been waiting is ridiculous, a blind man could see that this needs a public inquiry and they keep putting out reports and excuses and it's just not good enough.\"\nHe added: \"My main thing is to get justice for all these kids, name and shame every institution, every organisation that ran them and I don't care who they are - religious or otherwise.\"\nAbuse survivor Jim Buckley told BBC Scotland: \"I lived with it for nine years when I was in a home in Aberdeen, the abuse we suffered, there's never been any recognition of the fact.\n\"We've got to live with that day in and day out.

He is not responsible for the things which happened before his time.\"\nLatin American and Caribbean leaders at the summit in Panama have welcomed the reconciliation.\nBrazilian President Dilma Rousseff hailed it as a courageous effort to end the last vestiges of the Cold War, which she said had caused great damage in the hemisphere.\nPresident Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina gave the main credit to Cuba, saying it had fought with unprecedented dignity against the US blockade.\nThis summit was always going to be about the interaction between President Obama and Raul Castro.\nThe White House had hinted that they were interested in a one-to-one meeting although none had been officially scheduled.\nIn the end, it took place in a small nondescript room in a Panama City conference centre.\nThe two leaders did not look exactly at ease, sitting on small chairs slightly angled towards each other, but their tone was cordial.\nMr Obama called the meeting \"historic\". Mr Castro said he would continue taking steps to normalise relations between the two former foes.\nThe meeting was in essence symbolic. With the cameras flashing away, no decisions were made.\nBut its message was clear: we have our differences, but we can do business with each other.\nWhen 'historic' seems apt\nThe US broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1959 after Fidel Castro and his brother Raul led a revolution toppling US-backed President Fulgencio Batista. The Castros established a revolutionary socialist state with close ties to the Soviet Union.\nMr Castro has called for the lifting of the US economic blockade on Cuba and the country's removal from Washington's list of state sponsors of terrorism.\nFor Washington, political reform and human rights in Cuba are key issues.  Mr Obama is expected to remove Cuba from the terrorism list in the coming days.\nThe Summit of the Americas brings together the leaders of North, Central and South America. This, the seventh, is the first which Cuba attended.\nAttempts to improve relations between the US and Cuba began in December when Mr Obama declared Washington's approach \"outdated\".\nAs US ties with Cuba improve, those between Venezuela and Washington remain fractious.\nThe US imposed sanctions last month on a group of Venezuelan officials it accuses of human rights abuses. Mr Obama also issued an executive order declaring Venezuela a threat to US national security.\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has described the order as \"disproportionate\".\nPresident Maduro spoke briefly at the summit to President Obama, who stressed that the US was interested in supporting and not threatening Venezuela.\nThe Venezuelan leader disputed that view, but according to a tweet from one of his aides \"there was a lot of truth, respect and cordiality\" during the short conversation.\nThe summit also highlighted differences between President Rafael Correa of Ecuador and the US.\nMr Correa said the US had failed to live up to its ideals: \"Let's talk about human rights. In Ecuador we don't have torture, the death penalty or extrajudicial renditions.\"\nIn response, Mr Obama said the US does not claim to be perfect. \"We make a claim to being open to change,\" he said.", "Joseph Leach, 32, suffered serious injuries following an incident in Woodland Terrace in Washington, near Sunderland, in December 2013.\nHe underwent surgery at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary after the attack, but died on 2 April last year.\nKarl Pascoe, 31, from Washington, is due in court on 15 April charged with his murder, Northumbria Police said.", "Once a 100-tonne crane has lowered them into place the barrage will be drained so engineers can inspect its four massive \"fish belly\" gates.\nWorkers from the Canal and River Trust will then carry out necessary repairs.\nWhen construction began 20 years ago, Stockton's Tees Barrage was considered the largest civil engineering project in the UK.\nIt opened in 1995 and as well as controlling the flow of the river and preventing flooding it is also used for leisure activities including water-skiing, windsurfing and white water rafting.\nA public open day for people to find out more about the works will be held on 22 August.", "The allowance - introduced in April 2015 to incentivise marriage - is worth \u00a3220 in 2016/17.\nHowever those eligible can also back-date a claim for last year, meaning \u00a3432 can be claimed in total.\nOut of 4.2m couples who could claim that amount, only 1m have done so, despite an HMRC advertising campaign.\nMarriage tax allowance lets one half of a married couple transfer part of their tax-free allowance to their partner.\nHowever one of the partners must not be earning more than \u00a311,000 - the personal allowance - while the other must be paying income tax at the basic rate.\nA spokesman for HMRC said it takes less than five minutes to apply online.\n\"We don't know the reason why so few couples have taken up this allowance, but the fact is, it's a fairly quick and simple process and could save couples up to \u00a3430 - which can go a long way especially around this time of year,\" said Sam McFaul, a personal finance writer at MoneySavingExpert.com.\nAnyone wanting to claim can go to this page.", "The latest allegations follow the sacking last week of the UN's CAR envoy amid multiple allegations of sexual abuse by peacekeepers.\nThe UN said that alleged rapes occurred on an unspecified date in Bambari city.\nThe 10,000-strong UN force was deployed in 2014 to restore order in the CAR.\nA statement from the peacekeeping mission, issued in French on Wednesday, said that UN headquarters was \"immediately informed\" of the most recent allegations and that \"all available evidence\" was being collected.\n\"A new series of disturbing allegations of misconduct have recently come to light,\" UN spokeswoman Vannina Maestracci told reporters. \"The events allegedly took place in recent weeks.\"\nMs Maestracci said that Bambari is where troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are deployed.

This should engender an atmosphere in which honest, challenging, professional dialogue can take place.\"\nThe changes are due to come into force in September along with changes to the way Ofsted inspectors are hired and managed.\nMore Ofsted inspectors will be drawn from staff in good and outstanding schools and colleges, for example.\nBrian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \"While we welcomed Ofsted's plan to carry out short inspections of 'good' schools rather than full inspections, we felt that schools likely to be downgraded, or upgraded, should immediately have the required full inspection rather than being kept in limbo. We are reassured that our advice has been acted upon.\n\"We are also pleased that the emphasis in Ofsted's revised school inspection handbook will be on assessing schools on the outcomes they achieve for students, particularly in terms of the progress made at school.\n\"We believe it is right that the inspection system should focus on outcomes, rather than telling schools how to teach.

It's a new lease of life - I've been given confidence by both coaches to express myself.\n\"It's given me a new motivation, and I feel I'm being challenged and tested every day.\"\nFollowing England's exit at the group stage of the World Cup, Youngs was one of a handful of senior players under pressure for his international place.\nAnd he admits he had to prove his worth to Jones.\n\"To start with he was probably testing me out a little bit,\" said Youngs, who has 57 England caps and toured with the British and Irish Lions in 2013.\n\"But I feel like I've got a very good relationship with Eddie. He instils a huge amount of belief both within the squad and individually, and I really enjoy being coached by him.\"\nYoungs featured in all of England's Six Nations matches, and although he was dropped to the bench for the decider against France in Paris - with Danny Care starting in his place - his impact in the second half was telling.\n\"When [Jones] told me [I wasn't starting], he said I was going to come off the bench and win us the Grand Slam. I thought 'I quite like the sound of that!'\" Youngs said.\n\"At that point I said to Eddie it's just about winning the Grand Slam.\n\"Of course I want to start every game, but so does Danny, so that naturally isn't going to happen. I was just happy that I could come on and really help the team. The plan paid off, so credit to him.\"\nMeanwhile, Youngs says his decision to recently sign a new contract at the Tigers has been vindicated.\n\"Definitely,\" he added. \"I really think whatever happens this year, I feel like we are only just touching the surface under Mauge.

Three mothers also died.\nStaff shortages, medicines given in error and treatment delays were also among the incidents logged.\nThe Scottish government pointed out that in 2015 the country had recorded its lowest level of stillbirths.\nHealth Secretary Shona Robison also said that there were fewer neonatal deaths and fewer maternal deaths.\nThe minister's comments came following a BBC Scotland Freedom of Information (FOI) request into the number of \"adverse events\" taking place in maternity units.\nAcross Scotland from the beginning of 2011 until the end of 2015 there were more than 285,000 births, including 1,247 stillbirths.\nHealth board detailed minor incidents including slips, trips, bumps and falls, but also more serious events including:\nIn reality the total figure may be far higher than 25,000, because some health boards - including Greater Glasgow and Clyde - provided only the most serious events rather than all adverse events.\nThe figures did reveal almost 500 incidents in relation to staff shortages, more than 440 referring to medicine given in error, and more than 100 delays in treatment.\nThe FOIs also showed evidence of a series of staffing problems at health boards in Fife, Grampian, Highland and Lanarkshire.\nIt has raised questions over how many of these adverse events could have been avoided.\nOn Monday, the Scottish government announced an independent investigation into baby deaths at a Kilmarnock hospital.\nMs Robison said Healthcare Improvement Scotland would review care at Crosshouse after BBC Scotland revealed six so-called \"unnecessary\" deaths of babies at the hospital since 2008.\nFraser Morton said NHS Ayrshire and Arran health board had refused to carry out a review following the death of his son Lucas in Crosshouse Hospital last year.\nHe believed a shortage of staff and a lack of training contributed to the death of his son.\nGillian Smith, the director of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said there was a definite correlation between staff shortages and adverse events.\nWith new figures showing that more than 40% of Scotland's midwives were in their 50s and 60s, she warned that the country was facing a \"demographic timebomb\".\nShe added: \"There are always going to be adverse events of some kind... mothers and babies will still die for reasons we don't know and couldn't avoid.\n\"However, what we want is to look at all the avoidable incidents and take the learning we can from that.\n\"Learning from avoidable incidents in the only way we will get better.\"\nMs Robison told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that she had full confidence in Healthcare Improvements Scotland to carry out the national review of maternity services, which will report in a few weeks' time.\nShe added: \"Its remit will be to look into the questions being asked by families to make sure that the processes and procedures that should have been followed within Ayrshire and Arran were followed and to report to me after looking into all of those issues.\"\nShe acknowledged that she was ultimately accountable if future failures in the system were not addressed.\nShe said: \"Accountability lies both with the board and ultimately the chief executive of that board and eventually, yes, with me. Which is why that we need to make sure that all of these adverse events are subject to review, that lessons are learned. \"\nA project by the Royal College of Gynaecologists (RCOG) aims to halve the number of \"avoidable\" stillbirths in the UK by 2020.\nIts Each Baby Counts programme found 1,000 incidents of avoidable harm at birth in its first year of monitoring - with about 100 of them in Scotland.\nProf Alan Cameron, the principal investigator on the UK wide project, said: \"Some of these events don't cause any harm but they are recordable as adverse events. But some can cause harm and what is key is that the service sits up to recognise that and do something about it.\n\"Some of the events we have looked at are staggering. Some of the reports we have read beggar belief.\n\"Labour is the most hazardous journey a baby makes. If something goes wrong health service staff have to act quickly. That can be alarming. This is such an acute and unpredictable specialty.\"\nHe said BBC Scotland's findings showed that health boards had different classifications for serious adverse events, and he called for consistency.\nHe added: \"It is a concern that some areas are not doing as well as others in terms of outcomes from labour.\n\"I would certainly hope another Morecambe Bay would not happen again and that is why we need to put mechanisms in place to prevent it happening in future.\"\nFiling Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to Scottish authorities is nearly always an exercise in frustration. If they are not late they are incomplete, if they don't give you what you ask for they don't give it to you at all.\nMy request to the country's health boards for adverse event information hit more snags than usual. The responses issued gave a patchwork quilt of data - a frustratingly blinkered view of the actual figures. The ensuing inconsistent mishmash of data ultimately boiled down to how boards had interpreted what I meant by \"adverse event\".\nSome only returned data on \"serious\" adverse events - those incidents that resulted in actual loss of life.

We have come together to push for a more peaceful future.\"\nIt was an immediate effort to reject the narrative that Khalid Masood was an agent of Islam at war with the Christian West.\nTwo days later, a line of almost 100 Muslim women held hands on Westminster Bridge, bowing their covered heads in silence as Big Ben struck 16:00 BST on the first Sunday following the attack. Again, the message they sought to convey was one of unity, as opposed to enmity, between religious traditions.\nBut last Saturday, around 300 people gathered under a different banner. Members of Britain First and the English Defence League congregated on Victoria Embankment for what they described as a \"march against terrorism\". Paul Golding, the leader of Britain First, began by reciting the Lord's Prayer.\nThe attempt to categorise acts of terror as representative of the Islamic faith has gained much less traction here in the United Kingdom than it has in the United States, where it became one of Donald Trump's signature themes throughout his presidential campaign. He repeatedly castigated former President Barack Obama for his refusal to use the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\".\nBut President Obama, from the outset of his presidency, sought to calm tensions with Islam. His first overseas visit in 2009 was to Cairo University, where he offered a fresh hand of friendship.\n\"I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world,\" he explained, \"one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition.\n\"Instead, they overlap, and share common principles - principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.\"\nThis Wednesday, both the Protestant and Roman Catholic Churches in Britain will continue to press the case for engagement, as opposed to antagonism.\nAt 12:00 BST, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend what is billed as a Service of Hope at Westminster Abbey, which will bring together representatives of all those who were touched by the events of 22 March.

He will take four British imams to meet with Pope Francis at the Vatican, also on Wednesday. The BBC has been invited to travel with the cardinal's party.\n\"Pope Francis is committed to engagement,\" the cardinal says. \"When he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, he repeatedly visited mosques and engaged with the Muslim community. And his willingness to welcome our British imams is a further sign that he regards interfaith dialogue as being of the utmost importance.\"\nTo further emphasise this commitment, it has just been announced that Pope Francis will travel to Egypt later this month. In a statement, the Vatican said the Pope had accepted an invitation from President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Roman Catholic bishops, the leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the grand imam of Cairo's Al-Azhar mosque.\nNone of these meetings is intended to deny the profound theological differences that exist between these faiths, especially where it concerns the uniqueness and divinity of Christ.\nBut by continuing the dialogue, these faith leaders are sending a clear message to the communities they serve: that faith without works is dead and that dialogue must always trump conflict.", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nWill Grigg poked in Stephen Warnock's low cross to put the Latics in front just before half-time.\nAnd Warnock was once again the provider as he cut the ball back for Yanic Wildschut to fire in a low finish.\nEric Lichaj's late penalty for Forest was saved by Jakob Haugaard after Lica had been fouled in the area.\nAn FA Cup classic had looked unlikely, with both sides in miserable form, and it is Forest who have now gone seven games without a win in all competitions.\nThe visitors made few chances and saw little of the ball - and they have now lost six of their past seven matches.\nWigan - inside the Championship relegation zone in 23rd place - had been on an equally disappointing run, but they were superior to a side who sit three places above them in their division.\nThe Latics recovered from the early blow of losing Nick Powell to injury and could have added to their tally if Michael Jacobs and Jordi Gomez had done better with good chances.\nWigan boss Warren Joyce: \"Whether it's the cup or the league, it's just nice to win games.\n\"I was pleased with the performance and I thought we thoroughly deserved to win.\n\"I would have been very disappointed had we let them back in - and it was sloppy play that resulted in the penalty.\"\nNottingham Forest boss Philippe Montanier: \"It was a poor game.

Other than that, questions were being asked about whether the coup attempt had shaken Mr Nkurunziza's resolve to pursue his controversial third-term bid.\nBut instead of addressing these burning issues, Mr Nkurunziza chose to announce to the media that his country was facing a terror threat from al-Shabab.\nThe group itself was surprised  - its spokesperson said Mr Nkurunziza's remarks were \"dumb-founding\".\nA number of Ugandans I talked to about Mr Nkurunziza's remarks drew parallels with what happened in their own country in 2006 when parliament, on the instigation of President Yoweri Museveni, amended the constitution and lifted the two-term limit on the presidency.\nAnd all indications are that he is now set to run for fifth term.\nUntil then, Mr Museveni had been credited for bringing peace and stability to his country.\nIn fact, the Clinton administration described him as part of a \"new breed\" of African leaders.\nBut like Mr Nkurunziza, Mr Museveni's decision to lift the two-term limit on the presidency came at a great cost to his image - both locally and internationally.\nFormer US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson said at the time that \"many observers see Museveni's efforts to amend the constitution as a re-run of a common problem that afflicts many African leaders - an unwillingness to follow constitutional norms and give up power\".\nSeveral donors including the UK, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden cancelled millions of dollars of aid to Uganda, saying not enough had been done to return the country to democratic multiparty rule.\nMr Museveni surprised many by unilaterally deploying Ugandan troops to Somalia to prop up the transitional federal government, which was battling Islamist insurgents who later metamorphosed into al-Shabab.\nMany analysts saw Mr Museveni's move as an attempt to win back the Western support he had lost on account of his decision to scrap presidential term limits.\nThe US had for a long time wanted to see Somalia pacified to prevent it from becoming a terror breeding ground for al-Qaeda.\nThrough his military excursion into Somalia, Mr Museveni effectively played what has variously been referred to as the \"anti-terror\" card to make himself indispensable to the West - especially the US and the UK.\nUganda's government maintains that the decision to go into Somalia was done in order to prevent the conflict from spilling over into neighbouring countries, as well as to show that African countries can solve African problems.\nAfter the embarrassing 1993 \"Black Hawk Down\" incident, the US preferred to advance its objectives through proxies, and it is easy to see why Washington found it difficult to resist a strategic anti-terror alliance with Mr Museveni, who had already put Ugandan boots on Somalia's blood-thirsty ground.\nCriticisms of Mr Museveni's \"unwillingness to follow constitutional norms and give up power\" not only faded into irrelevance, he was now referred to by the same US government as a \"strong ally in the fight against terror\".\nSeveral African countries, including Kenya and Burundi, have since joined the \"war on terror\" under the African Union mission in Somalia.\nTherefore, on paper, Mr Nkurunziza may have genuine concerns about a possible terror threat to his country.  However, the curious timing of his remarks about a possible terror threat is suspicious - especially when one juxtaposes it against Mr Museveni's 2006 \"military charm offensive\" to win back Western support after he came in for severe criticism for scrapping presidential term limits.\nIs Burundi's President Nkurunziza using the al-Shabab threat to deflect attention from his domestic political woes?\nThis is the question on the lips of many socio-political commentators and analysts - and the jury is still out.", "Two shareholders are taking the bank to court, claiming it has failed to properly disclose investment risks associated with the environmental problem.\nCommonwealth Bank denies the claim.\nThe case is believed to be the first attempt globally to force financial institutions to tell shareholders how exposed they are to climate risks.\nIt comes as Commonwealth Bank faces a separate court action over its alleged breaches of Australia's anti-money laundering laws.\nEnvironmental Justice Australia (EJA) has filed a motion on behalf of two shareholders in the Federal Court of Australia, claiming climate change poses \"material or major risks\" to the financial position of both the bank and its customers.\nIn Australia, the risks include more severe droughts and cyclones as well as a rise in sea levels.\n\"Because it has exposures throughout the economy there are potentially some very serious financial exposures for the bank,\" said David Barnden, a lawyer for EJA.\nThe legal service says the bank ought to have known about those risks, and failed to disclose them in its 2016 annual report.\nThey are not seeking any monetary compensation.\nEJA says the case is only an attempt to force Commonwealth Bank to publish relevant information, so that investors can make better decisions.\nThe court action also called on Commonwealth Bank to detail its involvement in the Adani Carmichael project, which is worth A$16bn (\u00c2\u00a310bn; $13bn).\nThe controversial coal mine in Queensland is backed by India's Adani Group, and has been a target of environmental activists since it was first proposed.\nSeveral other major banks have ruled out involvement in the project, but Commonwealth Bank has been more coy on the issue.\n\"The provision by CBA of any form of financial assistance or funding for Carmichael posed, and continues to pose, material or major risks (including reputational risks) to its business,\" the statement to the court said.\nEJA hopes that if they win, this will set a precedent, forcing other companies to be more forthcoming about their exposure to climate risks.\nMr Barnden says Australia's corporate reporting rules are fairly broad, and he hopes a positive decision might be applied more widely.\n\"The codification is broad and talks about companies needing to provide a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the company,\" he said.\nThe bank flatly rejected the claim, saying its 2016 annual report was fully compliant with statutory reporting obligations.\nIt also said it is committed to playing its part in limiting climate change to well below 2.0C (3.6F) in line with the Paris agreement, and supporting a global transition to net zero emissions by 2050.\nThe bank is also facing legal action over failure to comply with Australia's anti-money laundering laws.\nThe Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre last week launched a civil action against the bank for 53,700 alleged breaches of the laws.\nIn an update to investors on Wednesday, chairwoman Catherine Livingstone said the bank was unaware of the breaches until 2015, three years after they had allegedly begun.\nShe said the bank had spent A$125m on strengthening its systems to deal with financial crime.\nDespite the bank's legal tussles, its annual results released on Wednesday were strong.\nCommonwealth Bank beat forecasts to post profits of A$9.88bn.\nThat is 4.6% higher than last year's results and the eighth straight year of record profits for Australia's largest mortgage lender.\nShares rebounded slightly, clawing back some of the losses the bank suffered after the laundering accusations emerged.", "His first came from a catch and drive, and the forward put the ball against the base of the post for his second.\nLeicester had Graham Kitchener sin-binned for a deliberate knock-on, leading to a penalty try for the hosts.\nThe visitors improved, Harry Thacker and Jono Kitto going over, but Ollie Devoto claimed a fourth Chiefs try.\nThe only cloud over a dominant Exeter performance was a shoulder injury to centre Henry Slade, which forced the England international off in the first half.\nWaldrom has been the Premiership's leading try-scorer in the past two seasons, and his double against his former club took him to 45 from his last 68 appearances.\nLeicester's touchdowns came after a scoreless first half effort, though Richard Cockerill's side had some intense spells of pressure.\nKitto's score came straight from kick-off, exploiting some poor defending, while Devoto crashed through after an inch-perfect pass for arguably the best try of the match.\nExeter Chiefs head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon: \"I just feel really pleased for the players - the truth is, all they've really done in this last eight week block is sit down and be really honest about things.\n\"What this season is going to end up like is now back in our hands - once you're in the top four it's for you to decide how the rest of the season goes - it's in our hands now, and that's how I want it to be.\n\"Let's get excited about the things we want to achieve, we want to achieve a lot - we were in a Premiership final last year and we want to be champions one day.\"\nLeicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill told BBC Radio Leicester: \"It was a little bit frustrating and indisciplined in the first half and we gave away cheap field possession, turning the ball over too easily.\n\"We came back pretty strongly in the second half and scored a couple, so that was encouraging, but I was disappointed by Thomas Waldrom's (second) try.

Around 270,000 of these birds are found on Santa Cruz island.\nThe finches are threatened by a nest fly which lays parasitic larvae in their nests which attack the young, usually at night.\n\"They are maggots basically, is what they are,\" said Prof Dale Clayton from the University of Utah, the senior author on the study.\n\"Some of the eggs are laid in the nostrils of the nestlings so those eggs hatch and the larvae begin feeding immediately in the nostrils so you see perforations through the bill in especially bad cases.\n\"They are pretty nasty customers.\"\nThe flies are believed to have arrived in the Galapagos in the 1960s.\nProf Clayton and his colleagues developed a mathematical model using five years of data to project the impact of fly damage on the reproduction rates.\nFinches breed more successfully in years when relatively high rainfall increases the food supply. They tend to do badly during extremely wet or dry years.\nIn two of the three scenarios that they modelled, the finch populations were declining and at risk of extinction. In the worst scenario the birds would be gone in 50 years.\nThe model showed that the critical elements in their survival were the probability that a given nest was infested by flies and to a lesser extent the proportion of adult finches that survive from one year to the next.\nBut the model also contains some good news according to the paper's first author,  Dr Jennifer Koop, who carried out the research as a doctoral student and now is an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\n\"Even though these guys may be going locally extinct, the model also shows that if you can reduce the probability of infestation, then you significantly alleviate the risk of extinction,\" she said.\nThe researchers argue that if the number of infected nests could be reduced by 40% then the risk of extinction would essentially be lifted.\nThere are a number of human interventions that could achieve this, they say, including the introduction of wasps that would lay their eggs in the fly larvae which would destroy them.\nAnother idea is to use pesticides. Cotton balls would be treated with the chemicals and left for the birds to incorporate into their nests.\n\"The birds will travel up to 60 feet or so and pull the cotton out and line their nests,\" said Prof Clayton,\n\"If they get at least a gram of that fumigated cotton in their nests, you kill 100% of the flies.\"\nThe scientists say that the stress from the flies might also provoke an evolutionary response in the finches. They point to a related species where the nestlings learned to become more vocal when attacked by the pest, as a result the parents fed them more and their survival rates improved.\nResearchers are concerned that these threatened finches may simply not have enough time to adapt.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.", "Georgina Jones, 92, from Dolwyddelan, has been awarded the BEM.\n\"Receiving the honour was a shock and a surprise when I had the letter,\" she told BBC Wales.\n\"I've been in the church all my life, playing in three or four services on Sundays.

However those numbers have risen sharply since the withdrawal of most Western forces in 2014.\nCorrespondents say the Taliban has gained in strength and now controls sizeable parts of the country. At the same time, international aid to Afghanistan has dwindled as other crises elsewhere attract greater attention.\nTens of thousands of Afghans have fled abroad in search of a better life.\nMeanwhile government corruption, lack of skills and a lack of international interest mean an IDP policy launched in 2014 that guaranteed access to food, water and education has seen almost no implementation, Amnesty says.\nInstead, many IDPs live under the threat of being forcibly evicted from both private and government accommodation, it says.\nLast June, armed men and police officers opened fire on IDPs demonstrating against an attempted forced eviction at the Chaman-e-Babrak camp in Kabul, killing two people and wounding 10, the new report says.\nIDPs also face myriad other challenges, Amnesty says, including:\nAmnesty has urged the Afghan government to make implementing its IDP policy a priority.\nIt also wants international donors to provide more funding and expertise.\nEarlier this year the UN asked for $393m (\u00c2\u00a3269m) in humanitarian funding for Afghanistan, but by May less than a quarter of this amount was forthcoming, Amnesty said.\nSome 2.6m Afghan citizens now live as refugees outside the country's borders following decades of war.\nHowever President Ashraf Ghani has called on Afghans to stop fleeing and instead stay and rebuild their shattered nation.", "18 March 2017 Last updated at 10:00 GMT\nDespite getting pelted with boiling rocks and steam thankfully everyone got off the mountain safely with no serious injuries.\nRachel Price who was filming at the time for the BBC managed to capture the moment the volcano erupted on camera.\nShe said it was scary but she is ok, despite a hot rock burning a hole in her jacket.\nShe's sent us this video telling us about her experience.", "Tobacco is the biggest culprit, causing 23% of cases in men and 15.6% in women, says the Cancer Research UK report.\nNext comes a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables in men's diets, while for women it is being overweight.\nThe report is published in the British Journal of Cancer.\nIts authors claim it is the most comprehensive analysis to date on the subject.\nLead author Prof Max Parkin said: \"Many people believe cancer is down to fate or 'in the genes' and that it is the luck of the draw whether they get it.\n\"Looking at all the evidence, it's clear that around 40% of all cancers are caused by things we mostly have the power to change.\"\nFor men, the best advice appears to be: stop smoking, eat more fruit and veg and cut down on how much alcohol you drink.\nFor women, again, the reviews says the best advice is to stop smoking, but also watch your weight.\nProf Parkin said: \"We didn't expect to find that eating fruit and vegetables would prove to be so important in protecting men against cancer. And among women we didn't expect being overweight to be more of a risk factor than alcohol.\"\nIn total, 14 lifestyle and environmental factors, such as where you live and the job you do, combine to cause 134,000 cancers in the UK each year.\nAbout 100,000 (34%) of the cancers are linked to smoking, diet, alcohol and excess weight.\nOne in 25 of cancers is linked to a person's job, such as being exposed to chemicals or asbestos.\nSome risk factors are well established, such as smoking's link with lung cancer.\nBut others are less recognised.\nFor example, for breast cancer, nearly a 10th of the risk comes from being overweight or obese, far outweighing the impact of whether or not the woman breastfeeds or drinks alcohol.\nAnd for oesophageal or gullet cancer, half of the risk comes from eating too little fruit and veg, while only a fifth of the risk is from alcohol, the report shows.\nFor stomach cancer, a fifth of the risk comes from having too much salt in the diet, data suggests.\nSome cancers, like mouth and throat cancer, are caused almost entirely by lifestyle choices.\nBut others, like gall bladder cancer, are largely unrelated to lifestyle.\nThe researchers base their calculations on predicted numbers of cases for 18 different types of cancer in 2010, using UK incidence figures for the 15-year period from 1993 to 2007.\nIn men, 6.1% (9,600) of cancer cases were linked to a lack of fruit and vegetables, 4.9% (7,800) to occupation, 4.6% (7,300) to alcohol, 4.1% (6,500) to overweight and obesity and 3.5% (5,500) to excessive sun exposure and sunbeds.\nIn women, 6.9% (10,800) were linked to overweight and obesity, 3.7% (5,800) to infections such as HPV (which causes most cases of cervical cancer), 3.6% (5,600) to excessive sun exposure and sunbeds, 3.4% (5,300) to lack of fruit and vegetables and 3.3% (5,100) to alcohol.\nDr Rachel Thompson, of the World Cancer Research Fund, said the report added to the \"now overwhelmingly strong evidence that our cancer risk is affected by our lifestyles\".\nDr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said leading a healthy lifestyle did not guarantee a person would not get cancer but the study showed \"we can significantly stack the odds in our favour\".\n\"If there are things we can do to reduce our risk of cancer we should do as much as we possibly can,\" he said.\nGlyn Berwick, of Penny Brohn Cancer Care, which specialises in offering nutrition and exercise advice, agreed.\n\"We know from years of experience the positive impact that changing lifetsyles can have.\"\nThe president of the Royal College of Physicians, Sir Richard Thompson, said the findings were a wake-up call to the government to take stronger action on public health.\n\"The rising incidence of preventable cancers shows that the 'carrot' approach of voluntary agreements with industry is not enough to prompt healthy behaviours, and needs to be replaced by the 'stick' approach of legislative solutions,\" he said\nThe government said it was intending to begin a consultation on plain packaging by the end of this year.\nDiane Abbott, Shadow Public Health Minister, said: \"The government is failing on all the main public health issues.\n\"And the message from Labour, the Tory-led Public Health Committee, campaigners like Jamie Oliver and even some the government's own policy panels is clear: the government's approach to tackling lifestyle-related health problems is completely inadequate.\"\nPublic Health Minister Anne Milton said: \"We all know that around 23,000 cases of lung cancer could be stopped each year in England if people didn't smoke.\n\"By making small changes we can cut our risk of serious health problems -

Forty-four people were arrested.\nMissouri governor Jay Nixon said the \"ramped up presence\" of the National Guard had been \"helpful\", and that he would monitor the situation to see if more resources were needed.\nRallies in the area continued on Wednesday, as at least 200 protesters gathered outside St Louis City Hall, holding a mock trial for Mr Wilson.\nSome demonstrators stormed the hall, shouting \"shame, shame\", and forcing police to lockdown the building, AP news agency reported. Two people were reportedly arrested.\nAnger at the ruling has spread to cities across the US.\nProtests were reported on Tuesday night in 12 cities, in addition to Ferguson: Philadelphia, Seattle, Albuquerque, New York, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Oakland, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Portland, Chicago and Boston.\nThose demonstrations were mostly peaceful, but rioting broke out in Oakland, California, where protesters started a street fire.\nIn Los Angeles, 130 protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct, the LA Times reported.\nPolice also arrested several demonstrators in Boston, Atlanta and New York, Reuters said.\nMichael Brown was shot by a white police officer, Darren Wilson, on 9 August, sparking protests.\nSpeaking out after the verdict on Monday, Mr Wilson told US broadcaster ABC that he had a \"clean conscience\".\nHe said that before the shooting, Mr Brown had pushed him back into his car, hit him and grabbed at his drawn gun, and said that he felt \"like a five-year-old holding on to [US wrestler] Hulk Hogan\".\nOn Wednesday, Mr Brown's parents said that they did not believe Mr Wilson's account of events.\nMr Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told NBC that Mr Wilson's remarks added \"insult after injury\" and were \"disrespectful\".\nIn a separate interview with CBS, she added: \"I don't believe a word of it.

But East Timor remained on its books as a former Portuguese colony still awaiting self-determination, and that lack of formal recognition continued to haunt Indonesian rule.\nSo can the UN now leave East Timor with its head held high? Compared to the messy outcome of many other UN interventions, East Timor is a relative success story. An impoverished, war-torn country has, in 13 years, become a fairly stable small state with promising economic growth prospects.\nHow much of that was down to the UN, and how much down to the efforts of East Timorese leaders like Jose Ramos Horta, is a matter of debate. No-one would dispute that the UN's assistance has at times been vital.\nFinn Reske-Nielsen, chief of the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (Unmit), said in a statement: \"The Timorese people and its leaders have shown courage and unswerving resolve to overcome great challenges.\n\"Although there remains much work ahead, this is an historic moment in recognising the progress already made.\"\nHe said the withdrawal did not mark an end to the partnership between the UN and East Timor, as \"challenges still remain\".\nThe UN directly administered the country until 2002 when it formally became a nation.\nBut the UN also displayed its characteristic faults in East Timor, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. Its missions were at times poorly-led, and staffed by well-paid expatriates of mixed ability; there was hubris in its declaration of success at independence in 2002, and the conflict which erupted between the young army and police in 2006 exposed flaws in UN planning.\nAn Australian-led International Stabilisation Force (ISF) was also deployed in 2006 amid violence that forced thousands of people from their homes.\nThe ISF ended its mission last month. As one of Asia's poorest nations, analysts say East Timor will rely on outside help for many years.\nOur correspondent says that the large international presence had an inevitably distorting effect on the economy of the capital Dili. Many East Timorese will be glad to see the UN go, but may also admit they have reasons to be grateful, he adds.", "It was the ultimate example of what looks increasingly like a regional insurrection in defiance of majority opinion, and no little advice, from the nation's capital.\nAlmost 60% voted leave in the Midlands as a whole.

he was to oversee the public testing of the voting system which has been vaunted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) as key to eliminate vote rigging and to deliver a credible election.\nThe Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System (KIEMS) will be used to identify voters and transmit results.\nA similar electronic system that was used in the 2013 election failed spectacularly, leading to manual counting of votes which some have argued allowed for voter manipulation.\nMr Msando had only been on the job for two months, having taken over after his predecessor was suspended for refusing to cooperate with an audit firm which was cleaning the voters' register.\nHis death will do little to assuage growing concerns about the IEBC's election preparedness and questions about its credibility.\nOn Twitter, his name and #RIPMsando are trending, with many expressing shock and disgust at what to them looks like a targeted elimination.\nThis news also comes at a time when the government has denied allegations by opposition parties that it is planning to deploy the military to swing the election to its favour.\nWith only a week to the election, this is no doubt another testing time for Kenya and it can only emerge from this tense moment by holding credible elections and arresting and prosecuting Mr Msando's killers.\nSome fear there could be violent clashes between rival supporters after the result is announced, with the losers refusing to accept defeat.\nHowever, few expect the type of violence which killed more than 1,200 people in ethnic, post-election violence 10 years ago.\nFollowing the clashes, the International Criminal Court charged President Kenyatta and his deputy with instigating violence, but the charges have since been dropped due to a lack of evidence.\nThe government has denied ICC accusations that its witnesses had been intimidated to prevent them from testifying.", "The 20-year-old joined Chelsea in 2013 and made his senior debut last season, scoring four goals in 16 games.\nHe is the first Burkina Faso international to score in the Premier League after his two goals last season.\nTraore, who had a previous loan spell with Vitesse Arnhem, has signed a new deal until 2019 with Chelsea.", "S4C chief executive Ian Jones said there had been a \"substantial\" decrease in such programming and \"we would support on all levels increasing that\".\nMr Jones was giving evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on the BBC's future.\nBBC Wales said recently that protecting news and politics coverage from cuts had made other programming \"thinner\".\nThe comments in April, by BBC Wales director Rhodri Talfan Davies, followed a speech by BBC director-general Tony Hall in which he admitted programming in Wales had been \"eroded\".\nOn Tuesday, Mr Jones said focusing on the success of programmes such as Doctor Who and Casualty was a \"red herring\".\n\"The production of Doctor Who and Casualty in Wales - it's good, it's extremely good, it helps the skills base, it helps competition and it helps the perception of producing, but I don't think that's the issue, that is in fact a red herring,\" he said.\n\"I think the people of Wales would appreciate more programming - more local programming through the medium of English.\n\"If I have any criticism of the BBC in Wales, that criticism is shared by former BBC directors in Wales and, I suspect, the current BBC director, in that there's been a substantial decrease in programming produced and commissioned over the years in the English language for the people of Wales and we would support on all levels increasing that.\"\nMr Jones cited the example of Hinterland, a recent collaboration between S4C and BBC, which was broadcast in both Welsh and English, and bought by a number of Scandinavian broadcasters as a recent success, which according to Mr Jones, showed there was increasing demand for local programmes.\nReferring to the relationship between the BBC and S4C, Mr Jones said it was working well because the operating agreement between the two stipulates that S4C is independent operationally, managerially and editorially.\nA BBC Wales spokesperson said: \"We obviously welcome Ian Jones's contribution to the discussion about the future of the BBC.\n\"As the BBC's director general recognised in May, the funding challenges facing English television programming in Wales are both significant and longstanding.\"", "29 January 2016 Last updated at 07:34 GMT\nMattel, the US company who make the toy, is adding \"tall, curvy and petite\" body shapes to its line-up.\nDifferent skin tones, eye colours and hair styles will also be added, the company said.\nMany people had complained that the traditional Barbie size was unhealthy, creating an unrealistic body image for girls.\nWith the new body shapes, the toy makers say they are \"offering girls choices that are more reflective of the world they see today\".", "But the report found helmets meeting the newest safety standards would not have saved his life.\nHughes, 25, was stuck by a bouncer during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground in November 2014.\nThe review, commissioned by Cricket Australia, also highlights a need for 'concussion substitutes'.\nHughes was struck on the neck and died in hospital two days later.\nThe governing body of the sport in Australia asked barrister David Curtain to lead the review into the incident.\nHe recommends that batsmen, wicketkeepers and close fielders in first-class cricket should wear protective helmets that meet stringent British safety standards in matches and in training.\nBut he said such helmets would not have saved Hughes' life.\n\"I do not believe the new helmet would have afforded additional protection against the blow given the location of where Phillip was struck, as the protection to the neck, at the rear, is no different,\" he said.\nHe also called for more evaluation into the effectiveness of clip-on neck guards in preventing a similar incident.\nThe review also looked into the medical care given to Hughes before an ambulance arrived some 20 minutes after the incident. It concluded \"the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury\".\nCurtain said it was beyond his remit to call for substitutes to be allowed to bat and bowl when a player has to leave the field due to concussion - under current rules, replacements are not allowed to do this.\nBut he added it was a \"concern\" that some players might not want to leave the field and leave their team short and said it was an area for Cricket Australia to explore.\nCricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said a number of recommendations in the review had already been implemented.\nHe added the body was already \"exploring the possibility of allowing a 'concussion substitute' during domestic matches\" and that the International Cricket Council would look at the issue at its next meeting on 31 May.\nA coronial inquest in Hughes's death will take place in October.", "In a letter to the Times, Nick Clegg, Ken Clarke and Jacqui Smith said jails had become unacceptably dangerous.\nThey said inmate numbers had risen to more than 85,000 since Michael Howard declared in 1993 that \"prison works\".\nThe cross-party trio pointed out that almost half of inmates are re-convicted within a year of being released.\nFormer Lib Dem leader and deputy PM Mr Clegg, ex-Conservative Home Secretary Mr Clarke and former Labour Home Secretary Mrs Smith said the recent violent unrest at Birmingham Prison was a \"wake-up call for this country\".\nRiot teams restored order to all four wings of HMP Birmingham last week after more than 12 hours of rioting described as the worst since events at Strangeways 26 years ago.\nRiot officers regain control of Birmingham prison\nReality check: Do England and Wales lock up more inmates?\nThe trio's letter said there had been a 31% increase in prison assaults in the past year, and one prisoner killed themselves every three days.\n\"We believe that an escalating prison population has gone well beyond what is safe or sustainable,\" they wrote.\n\"To restore order, security and purpose to our jails, ministers should now make it their policy to reduce prison numbers.\n\"If the tide is not turned soon, the prisons crisis will do untold damage to wider society.\"\nMr Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"with the benefit of hindsight and in a non-partisan way\" that he, Mr Clarke and Mrs Smith were able to make the suggestions.\n\"All Ken and Jackie and I are saying is yes, if we chose to as a country, we could move to American style levels of mass incarceration - it's very expensive, it's very ineffective - or, we can try and think again and make our prison estate smaller, safer and more effective in dealing with crime,\" he said.\nCutting the number of inmates to 45,000 would bring the prison population close to what it was under Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government, the letter said.\n\"The system is not serving victims of crime or properly protecting our communities either,\" it said, but did not explain how the three thought the reduction could be achieved.\nJustice Secretary Liz Truss has said violence in prisons \"will not be tolerated\".\n\"I started work at the prison more than 10 years ago. It was my first prison job and I was a fresh recruit.\nI felt safe at first. During the first few years I could count the amount of times I felt fearful for my own safety on one hand. Eventually it got to the point where I was fearful nearly every day.\nAt first, if you were dealing with an incident you would have colleagues around you.\nBut gradually I realised they were taking more time to turn up, mainly because they may be coming in from other areas.\nIt's a psychological process - you become more wary of challenging prisoners so prisoners become more confident and less respectful.\"\nRead more on this story", "10 February 2015 Last updated at 13:45 GMT\nThe austere 46-year-old former tax inspector is leader of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) - or Common Man Party - which has won the support of many ordinary people in Delhi who are tired of India's main political parties.\nBBC News profiles the man who is seen as a guy-next-door turned political upstart.\nVideo produced by Sara Barman", "The sold-out performance of the 13 November Stratford-upon-Avon show will also be shown live in cinemas.\n\"We want to bring the work we make... to the widest possible audience,\" said RSC artistic director Gregory Doran.\n\"Taking our productions live into cinemas and direct into schools is the next logical step.\"\nRichard II runs in Stratford from 10 October to 16 November before transferring to the Barbican in London in December.\nA recording of the live performance will be streamed direct into up to 1,000 schools on 15 November, accompanied by a live studio link-up hosted by Konnie Huq.\nMembers of the creative team, including Doran and Tennant, will take part in a live online Q&A as part of the initiative.\nTwo further RSC Shakespeare plays will be filmed live during 2014, the titles of which will be announced in September.\nTennant - recently seen in ITV drama Broadchurch and The Politician's Husband on BBC Two - previously worked with the RSC on its hit 2008 production of Hamlet.\nDoran, who directed that production, will also direct Richard II, which tells of a king whose vanity and weakness threatens to drag England into a dynastic civil war.\nSpeaking to the Guardian, Doran said it was \"very important\" that a way was found to \"re-imagine\" the production for a cinema audience.\n\"It mustn't just be like having a security camera peering at the stage,\" continued the director, who took over from previous RSC chief Michael Boyd last year.", "If enacted, the move would make Canada one of the largest Western countries to allow widespread use of the drug.\nHealth Minister Jane Philpott pledged on Wednesday to keep marijuana \"out of the hands of children and profits out of the hands of criminals\".\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau pushed for legalisation during his campaign.\nThe announcement coincided with 20 April - an unofficial holiday among cannabis advocates.

It's a shame about that list, I admit that.\"", "Pierre Bordry told the BBC that an international team of observers was being brought in.\nThis follows concerns over the way anti-doping was being handled by cycling's governing body, the International Cycling Union (UCI).\nThe AFLD has been prevented from carrying out extra tests this year.\nMr Bordry questioned the transparency of the UCI and said he had serious concerns about the biological passport for cyclists, the latest weapon in the fight against doping.\nBut the UCI says the decision to exclude the French was made by the World Anti-Doping Agency who fully endorse their testing programme.\nIn last year's tour, responsibility for anti-doping was shared between the UCI and the AFLD.\nIt was not a happy marriage. Afterwards the French complained that some riders, including Lance Armstrong and the winner Alberto Contador were given preferential treatment when it came to surprise tests.\nThis year the AFLD has been excluded from direct participation in the testing process.\nMr Bordry suggests that his agency's targeted testing, based on customs information and enforced by French police, is a more effective weapon than simply screening samples.\nMr Bordry says that the presence of international observers from the World Anti-Doping Agency, Wada, highlights his concerns.\n\"I think if this year there are three people from Wada to control UCI, surely there is a reason for that?\" he said.\n\"If there was no problem last year, there wouldn't be any people from Wada as observers? If the UCI system was credible there wouldn't be any people from Wada. So we will see if it becomes credible with Wada people.\"\nMr Bordry also says the recently introduced biological passport is flawed.\nThe passport works by establishing a biological profile of riders.\nProfessional cyclists give samples of blood and urine several times a year.\nAny deviation from their normal values is taken as an indication of doping even if the exact substance isn't known.\nBut Mr Bordry says cyclists can get around it by consistently taking small amounts of doping substances.\n\"I have no information about the blood passport from the UCI, I have information from some cyclists like Bernard Kohl saying some cyclists can do what they like with the passport, so if they have the same profile all the year, if they are doped all the year, they have a good passport,\" Mr Bordry said.\n\"The passport is not a good organisation for anti doping. I don't believe in the blood passport as it is done now.\"\nThe UCI rejects the accusations and says the decision to exclude the AFLD from this year's tour was made by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nThe governing body says its testing is rigorous and effective and they will do their best to protect cycling, to protect the tour and to reduce the risk of any doping offence.\nTheir spokesman Enrico Carpani also defended the biological passport.\n\"We have created the most sophisticated tool that many other international sports organisation would like to introduce,\" he said.\n\"We are explaining, we are selling the biological passport to other federations so that's proof that this new approach is the most important and the most reliable that sport has today to fight against doping.\"\nSo bad have relations between the two organisations become that Mr Bordry is refusing to let his scientists work with the UCI on new methods of catching dopers.\n\"I won't work with UCI - I don't want to work with UCI,\" he said.\n\"We work with a lot of doctors and specialists all over the world, so we have no international problem but we don't want to work with the UCI on these projects, because they are not scientific people.\"", "The large numbers have sparked such a profound crisis that the local mayor threatened this week to stop voters taking part in Sunday's general election unless he received more help from the government in Athens.\nAt the peak in August and early September, up to 1,500 Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans were arriving every day, according to local officials.

They were compared with 57 men of the same age.\nMen born from ICSI had almost half the sperm concentration and a two-fold lower total sperm count and motile sperm - that can swim well - than men of a similar age whose parents conceived naturally.\nThey were also nearly three times more likely to have sperm concentrations below the World Health Organization's definition of a \"normal\" level - 15 million per millilitre of semen - and four times more likely to have total sperm counts below 39 million.\nProf Andre Van Steirteghem, who led the study, said it had been the first chance to test the long-held theory that sons would inherit sperm quality issues.\nBut he said it was a more complex picture than might have been expected: \"Semen characteristics of ICSI fathers do not predict semen values in their sons.\n\"It is well established that genetic factors play a role in male infertility, but many other factors may also interfere.\"\nProf Richard Sharpe, leader of the Male Reproductive Health Research Team at the University of Edinburgh, said that since most cases of male infertility were unexplained, it was uncertain that the father's fertility problems would be \"inherited\".\nHe added: \"Importantly, the results are a reminder to us that ICSI is not a treatment for male infertility, but simply a way of bypassing a problem and leaving it for the next generation to deal with - something my generation seem horribly adept at doing.\"\nBut Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, said the findings were \"reassuring\".\n\"Twenty years ago we were telling parents that their sons might have the same problems as they did and that they would also need ICSI to reproduce.

It took a penalty shootout to separate the teams in the end, but with Rangers having played to their potential and Ronny Deila's side falling short of their own, the result was more than justified.\nRangers manager Mark Warburton stressed that work must continue to improve the squad, while chairman Dave King indicated plans remain in place to strengthen the squad.\nSo, what does the immediate future hold as Rangers prepare for next season's Scottish Premiership campaign?\nRangers only named five substitutes at Hampden, including 17-year-old midfielder Liam Burt. Injuries to Martyn Waghorn and Harry Forrester left the squad short up front, along with Michael O'Halloran and Billy King being ineligible.\nThe team needs strengthening - and the squad also needs more depth. Rangers have been relatively fortunate with injuries this season, but if the team wins the Scottish Cup final against Hibernian then Europa League commitments would place further strain on the squad.\nYet Warburton wanted a small, tight group to ensure all the players would be regularly involved and to maintain their hunger and desire.\nA smaller squad also provides a route to the first team for players from the youth set-up, but Rangers were light on options on Sunday with substitutes Nicky Law, Nicky Clark and Gedion Zelalem only being bit-part figures this term.\nThe starting line-up also needs additions in key positions. For all that Wes Foderingham is comfortable on the ball and so contributes significantly to Rangers' approach of building from the back, doubts remain about the goalkeeper.\nRob Kiernan and Danny Wilson played well on Sunday, but Rangers have been fragile at the back at times. That might be improved by the presence of an experienced, assertive and physically imposing holding midfielder, a position Warburton has long sought to fill.\nThe team needs more height and prowess in the air. Rangers tend to take short corners but still need to be able to defend their own area at set pieces. A centre-forward is also required, along with more options for the wide areas to provide competition.\nNone of that will be news to Warburton, who has been planning for next season, and the new recruits will need to fit into his game plan, so be technically adroit and tactically flexible.\nWarburton has generally preferred to sign players he knows, either from working with them at Watford or Brentford or coming up against them in the Championship, League One or academy level.\nThat can be restrictive, but the examples of Andy Halliday and Jason Holt ought to encourage a wider perspective. Both impressed in training before they were offered deals and have emerged as key players for the Ibrox side.\nThey were prominent, influential and accomplished on Sunday, setting the tempo and tone of the team's display. That reflects their performances this season.\nRangers' possession game was vital to their semi-final win. It established their confidence and assurance in the first half and took the sting out of Celtic's resurgence after the break.\nWhen Rangers were under pressure, the instinctive reliance on passing and movement restored some composure to their play. The team is also more comfortable in possession because the defence can be left exposed by the attacking full-backs and the way Holt and Halliday can play high up the pitch.\nYet for all that time on the ball, Rangers created fewer clear-cut chances against Celtic. There is a balance between routine and meaningful possession, which Warburton's team has tended to fall on the right side of more often than not, but stepping up a level, or two if they reach Europe, will mean that the approach needs to be executed by better players.\nWarburton has established foundations for the club to build on. The 4-3-3 shape and possession-based approach is used throughout the youth set-up and the philosophy will run deep at the training ground.\nIt has delivered success this season and can do so again in the next campaign. Warburton managed the same feat when he took Brentford from League One to the Championship play-off places.\nRangers fans have rediscovered the joy of following their team after a spell in the doldrums and amidst off-field turmoil. Ensuring that feel-good factor continues is important for the board as much as the team.\nSeason tickets need to be sold in large enough numbers to reduce the need for external investment from directors and shareholders as part of the rebuilding process, although that funding will be available when required.\nKeeping Warburton at Ibrox will also be critical to that sense of optimism - although the club must always have a succession plan in place and a clear strategy for maintaining the progress the Englishman has made.\nHe will be intrigued by a potential experience of European football and has stressed his commitment to the project at Ibrox. Suitors, though, will only have been impressed by the work carried out this season and some will inevitably come calling.\nThe shrewdest approach for the club is to accept that managers come and go, develop a long-standing strategy that maintains continuity and guides the search for successors, and establish a recruitment department and policy that works with - but is independent to - whoever is in charge of the first team.\nThat can all happen in time. For now, Rangers are on the right course, but with much work still to do to achieve the club's goals.", "\"That is what makes me unique and separates me from the others,\" O'Sullivan, 40, told BBC Sport.\n\"Watching sport, I am a winner's man but I like to be entertained too.

Chiefly, the organisers lacked broader military backing and failed to gain public and political support.\nBut another explanation may lie in the very different ideas the two sides had about how to get their message across.\nLate on Friday evening, the scheme seemed well-planned, with rebel troops sealing off Istanbul's bridges over the Bosphorus, surrounding the city's Ataturk airport and stationing tanks outside the presidential palace in Ankara.\nBut while they also raided major news organisations, the rebels failed to control the narrative and fundamentally misunderstood the significance of social media.\nA statement from the group, read on state broadcaster TRT by a journalist reportedly being held at gunpoint, announced that a \"Peace at Home Council\" was running the country and a curfew and martial law would be declared.\nWhat you need to know: A brief explainer of a complex story\n\"What's happening to our country?\": Shock in Taksim Square, Istanbul\nWho was behind the plot?: The thorny relationship between Turkey's government and military\nTurkey's ruthless president: Recep Tayyip Erdogan in profile\nTroops also stormed CNN Turk during the night, its Facebook live feed left showing an empty desk and chair.\n\"We are broadcasting until the last minute, as we think it is important for Turkish democracy and the future of the country,\" said CNN Turk anchor Basak Sengul, before being ushered out of the studio.\nIt was Mr Erdogan's message, however, that proved most important and which, combined with similar statements from other senior Turkish politicians, showed the country's democratic leadership was safe and well.\nBy the time he flew back to Istanbul from the Marmaris holiday resort in southern Turkey, thousands had defied the curfew, some lying down in front of tanks to halt their movement.\nEven if those behind the coup had been able to control traditional media, they could not stop people accessing news on Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and other platforms.\nMonitoring site Turkey Blocks said key sites including Facebook and Youtube had been blocked as the uprising began, later adding that they had seen a two-hour period of social media \"throttling\" but no evidence of a full internet blackout.

I'd give them a seven - they are still not quite firing on all cylinders and, as captain Alastair Cook admitted, there were moments when they took their foot off the pedal. But that is probably being picky.\nIt is always hard to accurately assess a team when their opponents are poor, as Sri Lanka have been for most of this series.\nBut one thing is clear: James Anderson is bowling absolutely brilliantly. Even if he was up against top-class batsmen, he would still be making the ball do the same things.\nHe is at the top of his game and his elevation to the top of the Test bowling rankings is richly deserved.\nFast bowling is such a fickle game, and so much of it depends on rhythm - the elusive code that is so hard to describe or quantify. Anderson was bereft of rhythm in South Africa, but suddenly he is running up happy again, 'kissing' the pitch and taking stacks of wickets.\nYou could argue that better batsmen would play him better, but in these conditions, moving the ball both ways, Anderson is a dangerous proposition for anyone on the planet.\nYou cannot underestimate the importance of the overs he bowled for Lancashire earlier in the season, taking 12 wickets at an average of 20.75 in three matches.\nNo matter who you are and how much Test cricket you have played, you do not get your rhythm back in the nets.\nWhat a contrast with Steven Finn. Finn was arguably the bowler of the series in South Africa, where Anderson struggled, but now his rhythm seems to have deserted him again.\nHe is not doing anything wrong - I know well from my own playing days that sometimes you can run in with just as much effort and think you are letting the ball go just as fast as always, but it just does not come out with the same snap.\nWhat worries me is that he has got no opportunity to rediscover his rhythm before the final Test at Lord's begins on 9 June - there is only one T20 Blast match for Middlesex that he could possibly play in.\nFinn has to play at Lord's. There has been some talk that England might want to have a look at Jake Ball, who has been in the squad for the first two Tests, but he can bide his time. Finn knows Lord's well and this might be his opportunity to get some form back.\nEven when you are winning, you must look to move the team on, and there are a couple of areas that will be causing the England management some concern at the moment.\nJonny Bairstow has been brilliant with the bat this summer but his wicketkeeping remains a work in progress. He does make mistakes: he drops catches and misses stumpings.\nIt is a very hard job, and slow-motion replays can be very cruel on keepers because you think 'how has he missed that?' But it happens in an absolute flash.\nBut I do not think his position behind the stumps is under threat. Unfortunately, those misses can sometimes be costly and, if he makes too many, his place as a keeper will come under scrutiny.\nThe other problem is the form of Nick Compton at three. Although he will be mighty relieved to have got 22 not out in the second innings as England chased 79 to win in Durham, his problem is that he has not scored heavy runs all summer - for England or Middlesex.\nLord's is a ground he knows well and he will be desperate to do well. It will be a flatter pitch than we have seen so far this summer and the conditions should be easier for batting.\nIf England can win the toss and bat first, he will have a really good opportunity to nail down that position - that is the way he will be looking at it.\nI do not think his England place necessarily hinges on how he plays in the third Test - there is quite a big break between that game and the first Test against Pakistan on 14 July and he could go away and score a stack of runs for Middlesex.\nBut if he does not get a score people will be looking at him even more.\nOne man whose place certainly is not under scrutiny is Cook. What an incredible achievement for him to become the first Englishman to reach 10,000 Test runs.\nHe has done it in the hardest possible way - opening the batting, much of it with the burden of captaincy, and with uncertainty over his partner at the other end. Those are three ingredients with which most people would find incredibly difficult to succeed.\nYou must have absolute admiration for him. He is not a stylist and he does not have people dashing in to watch him, but that is Test cricket.\nYou need players like Cook to blunt attacks and lay the buildings blocks of an innings for the team. He has fulfilled that role absolutely brilliantly, and he will go on.\nFor a while, he was as obdurate with his captaincy as he was with his batting and, as a skipper, you do not really want that. But he has definitely opened up over the past year and his confidence has grown enormously.\nYet he can still go out to bat, put everything away and focus on what he has to do with a bat in his hand - and that is a great testimony to him.\nThat focus has been in some ways Cook's defining quality as a Test batsman, and it was in evidence right from the very beginning.\nI remember him arriving in Nagpur after that long journey from the West Indies, just two days before making his debut, and he made 60 and a hundred.\nYou thought, 'this bloke's pretty special', because he can focus totally on batting. Long may he continue.\nJonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's James Gheerbrant.", "Mr Chalk told MPs the maximum five years was \"wholly inadequate\" as it was a \"horrible, violating crime\" that \"shatters lives\".\nHe added: \"All too often it's a gateway to serious violence.\"\nThe bill was adopted by the House without any opposition and will now get a second reading on 28 October.\nIn the Commons on Wednesday, the Cheltenham MP said he had been inspired to act by constituent Dr Eleanor Aston, who he said had suffered \"a horrific ordeal\" for seven years at the hands of a former patient.\nMr Chalk called stalking a \"horrible, violating crime\" that \"shatters lives\".\nHe added: \"Despite it being such a violating, intrusive crime, despite it having the capacity to do such significant physical and mental harm, it's still being treated as a minor offence.

His strongest moment may have come in his opening statement, when he laid out the case against Wall Street and the \"billionaire class\".\nAs the debate ground on, a few key defining exchanges stood out for both candidates:\nMr Sanders' righteous opening condemnations of income inequality and stagnant worker wages made his conciliatory position on gun control all the more apparent.\n\"We can raise our voices, but I come from a rural state, and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states, whether we like it or not,\" he said.\nIt's the one area where Mrs Clinton is decisively running to the Vermont senator's left, and she was quick to argue the Vermont senator was \"not at all\" tough enough on guns and taking on the National Rifle Association.\n\"This has gone on too long, and it's time the entire country stood up against the NRA,\" she said to cheers.\nTake-away: Mr Sanders stuck up for rural states, but will it fly with the majority of Democratic voters who live in urban areas?\nMrs Clinton's Republican opponents have hammered again and again on her perceived responsibility for the 2012 attack on the US consulate in Benghazi in which four Americans died, so one of the looming questions during the debate was how she would respond.\nAfter a long discourse on the US military involvement in Libya, she answered with one line: \"Unless you believe the United States should not send diplomats to any place that is dangerous, which I do not, then when we send them forth, there is always the potential for danger and risk.\"\nMr Sanders and the other candidates didn't press her, but it was an answer that could - and likely will - be characterised by a Republican opponent as indifference to the loss of American life.\nTake-away: As a former secretary of state, foreign policy should be a strength for Mrs Clinton, but her answers reveal a continued vulnerability.\nAs expected, Mrs Clinton was also asked about the ongoing controversy over her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state.

Could Mrs Clinton steal a march on the Vermont senator and position herself as the candidate to take on corporate titans?\nShe certainly tried, and spoke about how, as a New York senator in 2007, she confronted Wall Street on their risky business practices and told them to \"cut it out\".\nAt that point, Mr Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, saw his opening and waited, with finger raised, to deliver his sharpest attack.\n\"In my view, Secretary Clinton, Congress does not regulate Wall Street, Wall Street regulates Congress,\" he said. \"We have got to break off these banks.

Her opponents were either unwilling (Mr Sanders and Martin O'Malley) or incapable (Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee) of seizing the advantage.\nTake-away: Mrs Clinton is a skilled debater, but she had her flaws.

He then provided a lovely ball from deep that Defoe ran on to and easily turned James Tomkins to fire in.\nAt the start of the game, Defoe was the only Sunderland player in their starting line-up to score this season and while Moyes will be heartened to see two others contribute, his 34-year-old star striker gave yet another reminder why he alone will largely determine the Black Cats' fate this season.\nDefoe now has 14 Premier League goals this season out of the 24 Sunderland have scored in total as he came back to haunt the manager who he helped to keep the Black Cats up last year.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPrior to the game, Palace boss Allardyce said he would \"hate\" to see a repeat performance of the defeat by Swansea in early January.\nHe got something far worse.

I have to apologise for the first half.\"\nAllardyce has never been relegated from the Premier League, but he could see that record end this season if his side continue to perform like this.\nThis was Sunderland's second straight Premier League clean sheet but their first away from home this season and, although Palace's finishing was poor, it was another impressive performance from centre-back Kone.\nHe took his goal well, hooking his effort inside the far post after Hennessey could only parry Kone's intitial header under pressure from Billy Jones.\nBut it was the way he easily handled Christian Benteke throughout that was most striking, overpowering the Belgium striker and carrying the ball into midfield to release pressure and start attacks.\nFollowing another solid showing in the goalless draw with Tottenham in midweek, Kone, 28, looks to be back to the level that saw him coveted by other Premier League clubs last season.\nCrystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce: \"Fear gripped the players and it hasn't allowed them to express their ability.

but then turned back and faced the police officers.\n\"Witness B\" described the shooting as \"utter chaos\" with scenes that he would not even expect to see in a Third World country.\n\"I heard the screeching and the shouting and looked out of the window,\" he said.\n\"I saw him [Duggan] turn around because someone was blocking him. He ran back. There were coppers about. They asked him 'put it down' or 'get down'.\n\"His hands were practically up towards his face and he was not threatening. He did not look threatening - and the police officer just shot him. I thought they would just try to restrain him but, no, they just shot him.\"\n'Witness B' was in a high-rise building with another witness and recorded the scene on two cameras. He began the first of these seconds after the two shots were fired.\nAlthough he was more than 100 metres away, he said his angle of vision gave him a clear view of the scene - and he was adamant that the suspect was not holding a gun.\nDuring his evidence to the inquest, he was repeatedly challenged by counsel for the Metropolitan Police and its officers.\n'Witness B' spoke to BBC News after the death and provided his video footage - which the BBC in turn provided to the inquest.\nUnder cross-examination by Ian Stern QC for the police firearms officers, he was asked why notes taken by a journalist suggested that 'Witness B' had originally thought Mr Duggan had a gun.\n'Witness B' said he could not remember saying that and he denied changing his mind.\nMr Stern asked: \"How are you sure from 150 metres away that it was a phone?\" - to which 'Witness B' replied: \"20/20 vision.\"\nSpeaking to BBC News, the witness said: \"We were looking at it [from a high] angle. He did not have a gun at all. He was clutching a phone. By the looks of it it was small, it was ... silvery. It was just clutched in his hand. Looking at it from that distance, it was not a gun. He was not aiming and he did not take any actions to shoot.\n\"It was not a gun, I stick to my word, definitely.\"\nAsked if he believed that police needed to shoot Mark Duggan, 'Witness B' said: \"No, not at all. His look was a bit 'what's going on', baffled.\n\"They could have just approached him and put him down, put the cuffs on him. but they didn't.\n\"It could have been handled a lot better,\" he said. \"I just think that it was an execution and they wanted him dead.\n\"When you actually stop and put your hands up, then you expect to be arrested, not get shot.

Sadly there are some things in life that just can't be fixed.\"\nJudge O'Grady ordered Zhan to be placed on an interim compulsion order to the State Hospital and deferred the case until September, when he is likely to impose a lifelong restriction order.\nThe court heard that Zhan, who is of Chinese origin but who lived with his parents in Canada, flew to Europe and travelled to Glasgow after hearing voices saying he should go there.\nHe told a psychiatrist that he started seeing blood over the faces of people and thought they were zombies.\nZhan said he bought a knife for his own protection, although he had never carried a weapon in the past.\nHe said he feared that Mr Davis was a zombie who was going to attack him, but now understood he was just making a phone call.\nMr Davis, who had just finished his cleaning job, was on his way to do a second cleaning job as a favour to a friend on paternity leave when he encountered Zhan at 1928 BST.\nHe managed to stagger to the office in Bothwell Street he had just left, where his aunt also worked. An ambulance was called and he underwent a five-hour operation at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, but died the following day.\nAfter the attack, Zhan returned to his hotel room, where he booked a flight to Toronto via Amsterdam.\nZhan, who was travelling without a passport, was then detained at Amsterdam and later extradited to Scotland.\nThe court heard Zhan had mental health problems from the age of 14 and had consistently refused to take his medication. He had no previous history of violence or any alcohol or drug abuse.\nTwo psychiatrists who examined him in the State Hospital said he was a danger to the public and should be held in a secure unit.\nOutside the court, Mr Davis's father James paid tribute to his son - who was due to start a new job at a call centre days after his death.\nHe said: \"I'm gutted. I'll never be able to see my son any more.\n\"At the end of the day his (Zhan's) family can visit him every day, we will never see Michael again. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\"I just can't believe what has happened. Michael was a hard worker and had a lot of friends.\"\nHe added: \"He was growing up to be a really good man.\"\nMichael Davis's aunt Josephine McGinley, who comforted him as he lay dying in the street, said: \"The whole thing isn't fair, but we just have to accept it - nothing is going to bring Michael back.\"\nShe added: \"As we waited for the ambulance to arrive he told me he loved his mum.

I spoke to her, said I hadn't missed a match since Bath, and asked how many I was on.\n\"Anne was very much the statistician. She came back a week or two later and said: 'My 1000th game was your 700th game in a row'.\n\"After that, I lost track again. Then at the end of one season, I came in from work one day, and there was a card on the doorstep.\n\"It said: 'That game at Bamber Bridge was your 1,004th consecutive game. I'm glad there's someone as crazy as me.'\n\"The card was from Anne, and since then I've kept a record.\"\nFor Blyth manager Tom Wade - who has also supported the club since he was a boy - Friday's game against Hartlepool is a reward for Young and the Spartans' other diehards.\n\"It's a fans' club,\" said Wade. \"It survives on the revenue the fans put in, via the clubhouse or the gate money, so the Cup run is for them.\"\nAnd what does the gaffer make of Jeff?\n\"He's a fountain of knowledge,\" said Wade. \"If you ask him about a game in 1999, straight away he'll tell you the result, who scored - and whether it was a sunny day.\"\nSunny day or not, Jeff has no thoughts of packing in, especially as he's now the Spartans' fixture secretary and kitman, travelling to matches on the team bus.\n\"I know this might sound daft, but it's very rare I feel that I can't be bothered,\" he said.\n\"Having said that, I do enjoy the close season. It's a chance to catch up on some sleep.\"\nWith his job at an electronics factory giving him the time off he needs - \"you have to have flexible shifts if you're getting in from a midweek away game at 3am\" - 1,500 not out could easily become 2,000.\nAnd his amazing streak might have been even longer.\n\"A week or two after I missed the game at Bath in 1987, we played North Shields,\"  he recalls.\n\"I saw my mate there and he said: 'Why didn't you come to Bath?

Years later, the truth emerged: the works were actually not created by Walter, but by his wife Margaret - who painted them in secret while her husband took the credit.\nWhy did she go along with the deception? Would the paintings have become famous without the smooth-talking Walter to promote them?\nThese are questions that Burton explores in Big Eyes, which stars Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz as the Keanes, alongside Terence Stamp as New York art critic John Canaday who describes the artworks as \"an infinity of kitsch\".\nThe film reunites Burton with writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who worked with him on 1994 biopic Ed Wood, about the cult film-maker.\nThe director tells the BBC why he has long been fascinated by the weird-eyed portraits and how he copes with sharp-penned critics.\nHow far back does your association with Keane paintings go?\nSince childhood. I always thought of it as suburban art, because everyone had it. It was in people's living rooms, offices, doctors' offices, dentists' offices. You know that in childhood some things leave your memory, but these things stuck with me.\nI'm interested in pop culture and things; it was just something that was very present and it wasn't until the mid-90s when a friend of mine in New York told me the story about the Keanes. Like most people, until that point I had thought that Walter was the painter of the work, because that's what I remember.  I was like 'wow - this is an amazing, interesting story'.\nWhen I was in San Francisco I visited Margaret [who still has a gallery there] and commissioned a painting from her. It was a couple of years later that I found out that Scott and Larry, who'd written Ed Wood, had a script based on the story.\nDo you see an affinity between Margaret Keane and Ed Wood, who were both artists some people sneered at?\nAs much as people trashed the whole thing, there were a lot of people trying to copy it.  I know a lot of people that are inspired by the 'big eye' thing. You have to admit that there's a reason why people had it in their living rooms. Even if you hate it, there's something there - it's like Ed Wood, he's the worst film-maker in the world but at the same time there was a weird poetry to his films and you could remember them over other films that won Academy Awards.\nThat question of what's good and bad is something that I've always been interested in, because I've experienced it myself. I do identify with those kind of characters, because there's two sides to the story.\nIt's a lower budget film, with very few special effects, in contrast to your past work. Did that make it more personal for you?\nAfter doing lots of big studio stuff, it was nice to strip back, have a low budget, and have to move quickly. That reconnects you with why you like making movies on a certain level. You don't hear the term franchise, you don't hear about the McDonalds tie-in,  so it's quite nice to not have that kind of spectre hanging over you.\nIn the film John Canaday, the art critic, says Mr Keane \"is why society needs critics to protect them from such atrocities\". What's your relationship been like with critics throughout your career?\nFrom the beginning of my career, films like Pee-wee's Big Adventure or Beetlejuice were in the top 10 worst films of the year.  I've had that Batman's too dark, and this and that... or some people like it.\nI feel lucky because I know people who make a film and it gets some great reviews, and then they're only in for a fall.\nI feel like I've been sort of well-balanced.   I had movies being horribly reviewed that do very well, and movies that are reviewed very well but do horribly at the box office.\nMy MoMA [Museum of Modern Art] show in New York recently got almost completely panned - probably worse than Keane. At the same time we had the highest attendance ratings.  So you get a mixture of things, in a bizarre way it balances you out.\nDo you find at this stage of your career that you deal with criticism better than you did?\nI don't really read it too much. I actually have trouble looking at anything, even positive ones, or negative, I know enough - people tell me, so I'm not living in a dream world.\nYour next film is Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children - with Hugo star Asa Butterfield in the cast. What's your vision for the film?\nHugo doesn't seem like it was that long ago... [Asa] has obviously become a young adult, but he's still got an incredible presence, and I'm really looking forward to working with him.\nWhen I read Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, there was a vibe about it that felt different.  I think that's the key, to try to capture the spirit of the book. That's why I'm casting peculiar people.\nBig Eyes is out in the UK on Friday 26 December.", "Eliaquim Mangala is expected to depart, which would leave City with Vincent Kompany, John Stones and Nicolas Otamendi as established centre-backs.\n\"We don't have too much more to spend but we are going to see,\" said Guardiola, speaking before Saturday's friendly against Tottenham (23:00 BST).\nCity have spent about \u00a3200m this summer - \u00a3120m of that on three full-backs.\nThis month, England right-back Kyle Walker moved from Spurs for \u00a345m, Brazil international Danilo joined from Real Madrid for \u00a326.5m and France left-back Benjamin Mendy was recruited from Monaco for \u00a352m.\nThey join Portugal midfielder Bernardo Silva (\u00a343m) and Brazilian goalkeeper Ederson Moraes (\u00a335m) in arriving at City this summer.\nCity have also been linked with moves for Arsenal's Chile forward Alexis Sanchez and another Monaco player, \u00a3160m-rated 18-year-old France striker Kylian Mbappe.\nHowever, Guardiola declined to answer questions on that duo, stating that \"they are Arsenal and Monaco players\".", "Early on Monday morning, a hill near Freetown collapsed after heavy rain, burying many houses.\nThere has also been a lot of flooding, which has swept many more homes away.\nA BBC reporter said that lots of people may have been asleep when the mudslide happened.\nSo far, almost 400 people have lost their lives and at least 600 more are still missing.\nMany have been left homeless after their houses were destroyed in the tragedy.\nSierra Leone's president said the country would need \"urgent support\" to recover from what has happened.\nThe emergency services are working very hard to try to find people who are still missing.\nBut because of the floods and the damage, it is hard to get equipment and helpers to where they are needed.\nThey are also working hard to try to stop any outbreaks of diseases, like cholera, which are spread in dirty water.\nIt is not unusual for flooding to be a problem in the country, with rain often affecting the area around Freetown.\nBut Sierra Leone is one of the poorest countries in the world, so it is difficult to cope when terrible events like this happen. That's partly because there isn't enough money to deal with the situation.\nAlso, a lot of homes are not built properly, so when there is bad flooding, these houses can be damaged and swept away, which leaves people with nowhere to live.\nThe president says everybody needs \"to stand by each other and to help one another\", as the country recovers from what has happened.", "Wall Street and bourses across Europe have been recovering some of the ground since the UK voted last week to leave the European Union.\nIn Japan, the benchmark Nikkei 225 share index finished 1.6% higher at 15,566.83.\nShares in carmaker Toyota rose by more than 2% despite fresh recalls over faulty airbags.\nOther markets across Asia also saw gains, despite the continued uncertainty in the wake of the UK's referendum vote.\nInvestors are hoping that central banks will step in with more stimulus measures should the global economy weaken.\nHong Kong's Hang Seng closed 1.3% higher at 20,436.12 while the mainland benchmark Shanghai Composite finished up 0.65% at 2,931.59.\nIn Australia, the ASX/200 index also closed higher, up 0.8% at 5,142.40.

The majority were vehemently opposed.\nThere were plenty - including, memorably, David Beckham - who maintained their association with United but made their feelings plain by wearing the green and gold colours of the club's first ever strip, which protestors adopted as their uniform of choice.\nMore militant figures left completely.\nThose responsible for its establishment maintain that FC United - based in Moston in Greater Manchester and now members of the Northern Premier League - was not formed in direct response to the Glazer takeover but as a result of the growing globalisation of the national game, which took it away from its traditional fan base.\nYet the fact remains that the fan-owned non-league side's first game was played in 2005, just weeks after the takeover and before Best's passing.\nThe reason for all the antipathy? Money.\nIn buying out major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who had fallen out with Sir Alex Ferguson over the ownership of star racehorse Rock of Gibraltar, Glazer was effectively in the process of completing a \u00a3790m takeover with the club's own cash.\nThe prospect so alarmed some fans on the night the deal was completed that hundreds arrived at Old Trafford to voice their opposition, forcing three of Glazer's six children - current co-chairmen Joel and Avie, plus non-executive director Bryan - to be spirited out of the stadium in a van for their own safety.\nIn addition to the actual \u00a3525m debt dumped on the club's balance sheet after the takeover, it is estimated around \u00a3696m has been spent facilitating it, through interest payments, bank charges and debt repayment.\nUnited have gone from being the richest club in the world to the one that owes the most money.\nYet financial Armageddon, predicted by so many, failed to materialise.\nFor Glazer had been proved correct in his assessment of United as a cash cow, capable of generating vast sums in commercial income, which rose to a staggering  \u00a3152.5m last year and will take another substantial leap forwards when the club's annual results are released in September.\nIn adopting a franchise-based approach to their commercial operations, United opened the door to untold riches.\nEd Woodward, now executive vice-chairman, who drove through the Glazer takeover, set about maximising the club's off-field potential.\nIt brought alliances with airlines, tyre companies, watchmakers and crisp manufacturers, amongst others, taking United's brand into every corner of the globe, hunting down the 657m followers it is claimed they have.\nThe policy set the template every other major club has followed.\nCrucially, in those early days, Ferguson continued to deliver trophies.\nFrom 2007 to 2009, United won three Premier League titles, lifted one Champions League trophy, lost a final and reached another semi-final.\nThey won the League Cup, played in an FA Cup final and lost a semi-final. It represented the most prolific three-year spell in the club's history.\nTwo more championships were won before Ferguson called time on his illustrious tenure.\nThe Scot himself was a fervent champion of the Glazer regime, repeatedly praising the Americans for their stewardship.\n\"Malcolm Glazer never set foot in Old Trafford but was a figurehead of that controversial takeover of Manchester United.\n\"In terms of practicalities and the day-to-day running of the club, very little will change and the business will continue to be run on the same basis it has been for a number of years.\n\"The club's debt payments have been reduced but I think it is fair to say fan anger over those debts remains and will not go away.\"\nThere is debate about the precise words he used when confronted by fans at Budapest airport in 2006 ahead of a Champions League qualifier with Debrecen and questioned why he stood by a regime so loathed by supporters.\nYet Ferguson was brutally dismissive. It remained that way until the Scot's retirement.\nLong-standing chief executive David Gill, who had opposed the Glazer takeover as \"potentially damaging\" but opted to remain once the deal was signed, said in 2012 that those who maintained their offensive against the owners were \"anti-people\".\nYet many United fans looked beyond the silverware.\nThey preferred to question the relative lack of spending on a squad growing increasingly inadequate to match major rivals Chelsea and Manchester City.\nThrough it all, Glazer stayed away.\nInitially it was through choice, eventually ill-health. At no point did Glazer utter a word in public to either explain or defend his actions.\nThe ownership of United has long since been transferred to Glazer's six children, with all the signs that the club will carry on its chosen path.\nGlazer's death happens to have come at the most uncertain period for United on the pitch since 2005, with David Moyes, the man chosen to succeed Ferguson, sacked before completing a single season and the club finishing in their lowest league position for almost 25 years.\nFor this, some will blame Glazer outright. Others would prefer to imagine he never existed at all.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGlazer will not be missed by the rank and file in Manchester, but he will never be forgotten.\nYet, for the strength of opinion against Glazer on this side of the Atlantic, in his homeland he is regarded as a  positive figure.\nFlags flew at half mast at the home of Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the American football franchise he owned, while players and officials paid warm tribute.\nAfter all, the Bucs lifted the Super Bowl under Glazer's stewardship in 2002. Their new stadium was his responsibility, too.\nThey may have been equally reluctant to speak in public, but in Tampa the Glazer family were afforded a warmth never replicated in Manchester.", "All of the managerial movements for May will appear below, followed by the full list of each club, league-by-league.\nTo read the list for April, visit the ins and outs page.", "Having bowled out Lancashire for 467, to set a target of 295 to win, Somerset looked in contention on 78-2.\nBut Anderson struck twice in 10 balls to remove ex-England team-mates Marcus Trescothick (36) and Steven Davies.\nRyan McLaren (4-37) and Jordan Clark (3-12) ensured Somerset were then shot out for 130 to lose by 164 runs.\nAfter being bowled out in their first innings for 109, before allowing Somerset to open up a first-innings lead of 169, Lancashire's hopes of getting anything other than three bonus points from the game looked grim when they fell to 23-2 second time around midway through day two.\nBut a 245-run third-wicket stand between stand-in skipper Liam Livingstone and wicketkeeper Alex Davies at least gave them something to bowl at.\nAnd, after lunching on 29-0, seven wickets went down for 78 runs in the afternoon session, including the key wicket of James Hildreth - lbw to McLaren for 43 -  to set up victory.\nSparked by Anderson's brilliant spell, only Hildreth and Trescothick made double figures as Somerset, coached by native Lancastrian Matt Maynard, suffered a second successive defeat.", "Everyone wanted tariff-free access to EU markets, the shadow chancellor said.\nBut there was a debate on-going within the Labour Party about whether the best option was continued membership or a separate agreement, he added.\nJeremy Corbyn has suggested the single market is \"inextricably linked\" to EU membership and the UK cannot remain.\nSpeaking on Sunday, the Labour leader said leaving the EU meant leaving the EU's internal market - whose members must abide by rules on the free movement of goods, capital, services, and labour.\nThe party's international trade spokesman, Barry Gardiner, has gone further, saying the UK should also rule out remaining in the customs union beyond any transitional period, claiming that failing to do so would make the UK a \"vassal state\" unable to negotiate sovereign trade deals.\nHowever, many Labour MPs disagree with both positions - arguing that it is in the UK's economic interests to remain in both.

and warns that international aid for education is below the levels of 2010.\nThe lack of education is also far worse among the poorest communities.\nAmong the poorest rural girls, only 1% are likely to reach upper secondary school.\nThe report from Unesco highlights the benefits of wider access to education - helping to build more stable, prosperous, peaceful societies, improving health and reducing child deaths.\nIt says that inequality in education \"heightens the risk of violence and conflict\" and that countries with high levels of education are much less likely to face conflict and war than the poorest, least-educated countries.\nThe study says if there was universal upper secondary education by 2030, per capita income in poorer countries would increase by 75% in the following 20 years.\nThe lack of facilities in schools is also examined, with a lack of electricity affecting many schools in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe promise that all children should have the right to primary education was first made in 1990, with a commitment that it would be achieved in a decade.\nWhen that was missed, another 15-year target was set in 2000.\nIn 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals were adopted by world leaders, setting development targets to be reached by 2030.\nA year later, Unesco is suggesting that the promise of universal primary education is already off track.\nIf it really does take until 2042, it will be more than five decades after the international community made its first promise.\n\"This report should set off alarm bells around the world and lead to a historic scale-up of actions,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, economist and UN special adviser.\n\"The gaps in educational attainment between rich and poor, within and between countries, are simply appalling,\" said Mr Sachs.\n\"Today's children will be retiring before we manage to provide a decent education for every child,\" said Vikas Pota, chief executive of the Varkey Foundation, which runs the annual Global Teacher Prize.\n\"It is truly appalling that between 2013 and 2014 education aid actually fell by $600m -

In 2014, revisionists have been trying to improve the image of the generals.\"\nMills' research drew on books, war-time poetry, soldiers' letters, archive photographs and satirical postcards, and some inspiration from 1969 film Oh! What a Lovely War. War-time letters were a major influence and correspondence between Charley and his mum, a munitions worker back home in Bethnal Green, was used as a plot device in the early strips.\n\"To write the story I had to understand the complexities of the trenches. It was a learning curve. I owe a lot to Charley's War because it made me a better writer,\" said Mills.\nArtist Colquhoun had served as a sailor during World War Two. Before illustrating Charley's War, he had provided the artwork for another Battle comic story, Johnny Red. Set in WW2, its hero is a British pilot fighting for the Russians. Mills said Colquhoun was a hugely talented but modest man. \"Joe had this great imagination. Other artists have told of him being able to imagine something, like a tank for example, from different angles. In Johnny Red, he created this amazing street scene of Stalingrad,\" said Mills.\nMills and Colquhoun were determined to root Charley's War in fact. The Battle of the Somme was among the battles featured.\nBut young Charley's face-off with an armour-clad German sniper proved controversial.

crisis.\nThe government said the scheme's impact was positive and set to grow.\nIt stressed the figures, revealed in a written answer to a parliamentary question, referred to the first round of trainees to graduate from the scheme.\nIn another answer, schools minister Nick Gibb said a total of 551 applications had been received for the scheme which began training people in 2014.\nThis led to 41 individuals starting the programme in its first year.\nSince then 28 of the 29 who completed the programme had achieved qualified teacher status (QTS), he said.\nMs Powell said: \"I very much want to see more veterans re-training to become teachers as they have a huge amount to offer and we desperately need more good teachers.\n\"What's clear is that, as with the government's general slow response to teacher shortages, this scheme isn't working because the government isn't focusing on teacher recruitment.\n\"We urgently need a proper strategy for teacher recruitment, including of veterans for whom this could make a great second career.\"\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"The 28 graduates referred to are the first trainees to be recruited and completed their two-year course at the end of December.\n\"A further two cohorts are being trained right now which means that more than 140 former troops are working in our classrooms and record numbers of eligible applicants have applied for the latest cohort.\"\nThese figures relate to recruitment for 2016.\nThe spokesman added: \"The impact of these recruits in the classroom has been overwhelmingly positive with head teachers praising the influence they've had on pupils' attainment.\"\nIt is not the first time the low take-up of the scheme has been in the news.\nIn July 2014, the BBC News website reported the scheme had sent a total of 41 trainees to England's classrooms in its first year.\nThe revelation comes just a week after a National Audit Office report highlighted how the government had missed its teacher recruitment targets for four years in a row.\nThe Troops to Teachers scheme, run by the University of Brighton, is based on the idea that military values such as leadership, discipline, motivation and teamwork are particularly useful for teaching.\nFirst mooted in 2008, it provides non-graduate recruits with on-the-job training four days a week, with one day reserved for academic study.\nTrainees go straight into the school-based programme after a minimum of one week's work experience in a school. They start to teach after spending two terms observing.\nAfter two years, trainees count as \"newly qualified teachers\" and gain an honours degrees in education, specialising either as secondary school subject teachers or as primary teachers.\nSome teaching unions criticised the entry requirements for the scheme and questioned the notion that a good service record meant a candidate would make a good teacher.", "Polling stations are open from 07:00 to 22:00 BST on Thursday, with 4,285,323 people - 97% of the electorate - registered to vote.\nDuring the campaign there has been much debate about the likely impact on Wales of the result, whichever way it goes.\nVoters will answer \"Yes\" or \"No\" to the referendum question: \"Should Scotland be an independent country?\"\nCounting will take place through the night, with the result expected to be declared on Friday morning.\nFollow reaction to the results as they come in on the BBC Wales News live page from 22:30 BST.", "The Nikkei closed up 1.3% at 20,376.59.\nStock markets around the world had fallen on Monday in reaction to the \"no\" vote in Greece's referendum, but the declines were not as bad as feared.\nOn Tuesday, Greece is expected to present new proposals at a eurozone emergency summit.\nThe plan is said to include a demand for Greece's debt to be cut by up to 30%.\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) is maintaining its pressure on Greek banks, refusing to increase emergency lending and ordering them to provide more security for existing emergency loans.\nOn Monday, the main share indexes in the US all closed down about 0.3%.

But total solar eclipses are special because they afford particularly favourable conditions to study the tenuous outer atmosphere of the Sun called the corona.\nIt is in this superheated \"gas\" of charged particles that the solar wind originates, and from which billions of tonnes of matter can occasionally burst towards the Earth to disrupt satellites, communications and even electricity grids.\nThe corona is outshone by the Sun's surface, its photosphere. And satellites will block out this glare using devices called  coronagraphs or occulters. But these are usually so wide that they also obstruct a doughnut of light immediately above the edge of the star.\n\"The spacecraft block out not only the Sun but also a whole lot of light around it, otherwise there would be scattering all over the image. And so we have that whole region uniquely to observe in white light from the ground at total solar eclipse,\" says Jay Pasachoff from Williams College, a veteran of 65 eclipses.\nAnd he wants members of the public to get in on the act.\nOne key project in the planning is the Citizen Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse (CATE) project run by the National Solar Observatory.\nIt is making available 59 identical telescopes and digital cameras to universities, schools and astronomy clubs along the path of the eclipse (another 40 observing kits are available to purchase).\nParticipants are being trained to gather images of the corona from their locality that can then be spliced together with everyone else's to produce an uninterrupted 90-minute video.\nCitizen CATE will rely on dedicated, calibrated equipment.

Which, if you remember from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was 42.\nHowever, I invite you today - as I have been comparably invited - to consider the good people of Helensburgh and the delight they take in swimming.\nWhy, I hear you ask, not unreasonably? Because the fair burgh on the Clyde got five million quid in the 2016 UK Budget to spend on a pool.\nAnd? And it wasn't part of the Barnett formula in any way. It was cash on the nail, for lanes and diving boards and the like.\nThis matters how? Because it proves, according to the UK government, that money may be allocated outwith Barnett - just as in the case of the \u00c2\u00a31bn going to Northern Ireland as part of the confidence and supply deal with the DUP.\nTold you it was a stretch.\nStill, let us give it a run (or, in the case of Helenburgh, let us take the plunge). Let us consider, dispassionately, as always, the competing arguments.\nFirstly, the formula named after Joel Barnett does not generally draw comparisons between Scotland and the other devolved territories of the UK.\nIt predicates a sum spent upon government departments in England and applies two factors. The comparability factor - that is, the extent to which the English spending compares with demands placed upon a devolved administration.\nAnd the population factor - a sum which calculates the relative numbers of citizens in England, Scotland etc.\nSo, strictly, the cash for NI does not, of itself, instantly demand Barnett comparability.\nThen two other points. The Barnett formula is non-statutory. Its rules are by convention and agreement. Its rules are, ultimately, what the Treasury say they are.\nAnd there has been formula bypass in the past. I refer my honourable friends to the topic of the Helensburgh swimming pool, no doubt to be a source of joy and delight to the residents of John Logie Baird's birthplace. Plus City Deals and substantial cash for NI in the past.\nGood caveats all. Reasonable and arguable. Expect to hear them advanced in the coming days.\nHowever, there is a wee snag here. It was not the opposition parties who insisted, initially, upon the application of the Barnett formula in relation to any putative DUP deal. It was the Secretary of State. For Scotland.\nIn advance of today's deal, David Mundell said there were rules about funding in the UK. Clear rules. And, he added, if the funding fell within the scope of Barnett then cash should come to Scotland too.\nIndeed, he signalled that he would contest any deal which breached that position.\nPedants that they are, Mr Mundell's rivals now want to hold the Secretary of State to his word. They say he should join them - the Scottish and Welsh governments plus others - in demanding a wider distribution of cash.\nThe Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson says this is hypocrisy. That those critics know that formula bypass is feasible. That the deal is intended to ensure UK stability.\nAnd the line from the Scotland Office? I suspect they have had better days. But they insist that the Secretary of State was simply demanding clarity: that he wanted an upfront deal, rather than anything in any way underhand.\nIt is implied further that he may now be able to wield influence to secure future advantage for Scotland with the Treasury, citing today's controversy.\nSomehow, I cannot see Mr Mundell's critics buying that one. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh First Minister, calls the package \"an outrageous straight bung\". He dismisses talk that it compares with formula-bypassing expenditure such as city deals (or the Helensburgh poll which, unaccountably, he failed to mention).\nAnd Nicola Sturgeon? She says it is a \"grubby, shameless deal\" which deprives Scotland of, potentially, around \u00c2\u00a32.9bn.\nThese critics say they do not remotely begrudge additional expenditure in Northern Ireland. They simply want comparability. And they question whether the cash would have been contemplated at all had Theresa May gained a majority in the Commons.\nThey think they know the answer to that one. And it is not 42.", "The Guinness World Record was last set in 2010, when 102 people met at Adventure Island in Southend in Essex to ride the Green Scream.\nThe new attempt was a fundraiser for Southend Hospital Charitable Foundation's Keyhole Cancer Appeal.\nIt was hoped 122 people would ride the rollercoaster, but only 57 took part.\nThey travelled from all over the UK, including Edinburgh, Newcastle and Swindon, to take part in the challenge.\nAdventure Island operations director Andrew Renton said: \"It's been an absolutely superb day with people all enjoying the chance to do something memorable, good fun and raise a large amount of money for a fantastic, local charity.\"\nLucy Thomas-Clayton, from Southend Hospital Charitable Foundation, said: \"It takes a lot of nerve to take off all your clothes in front of complete strangers, plus the world's media -

and we're not in that right now - the process for regaining or retaining, depending on where we are in the Brexit process, EU membership.\n\"Now it may be that we have a phased approach to that by necessity.\"\nAsked whether that could mean Efta membership first and EU membership later, she said: \"It may be by necessity, even if we didn't want that.\"\nIt is supposed to be the Brexit election.\nYet in Scotland, on the campaign trail, you're more likely to hear talk of independence.\nOf the four parties in Scotland defending seats at Westminster, the one least likely to major on independence in this campaign is the SNP, even though it exists to achieve independence.\nThere's an obvious reason for that. Independence divides opinion and in any election the SNP wants to broaden its appeal beyond \"Yes\" voters.\nThis has worked successfully for the party in the past.\nIn 2015, the SNP positioned itself as the party best placed to \"stand up for Scotland's best interests\" at Westminster.\nIt secured its best ever election result, winning 50% of the vote, 5% above the level of support for independence in the 2014 referendum.\nIn this year's election, Nicola Sturgeon has also sought to redefine the mandate that she is seeking in this UK general election.\nIt is, she said, \"to demand a place for Scotland at the Brexit negotiating table and the inclusion of the case for our place in the single market in the negotiating remit\".\nThat is a \"more immediate priority\" than indyref2, Ms Sturgeon said.\nRead Glenn Campbell's full article here.\nJackson Carlaw, Scottish Conservative deputy leader, responded to Ms Sturgeon's words by describing her position on Europe as \"complete chaos\".\nHe said: \"She claims we must have a referendum on independence because we're leaving the EU.\n\"Now, in a cynical attempt to win back Leave voters who have deserted the SNP, she now refuses to say whether an independent Scotland would go back in.\n\"And her flirtation with EFTA would leave us with all the obligations but no voice in decision-making.\"\nLabour's Kezia Dugdale said: \"The reality is the Nationalists have quietly shifted away from a policy of immediate EU membership if Scotland leaves the UK.\n\"Nicola Sturgeon claims Scotland must leave the UK because of Brexit, but won't even commit to rejoining the EU straight away.\"\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, accused Nicola Sturgeon of \"selling out pro Europeans\" to win back Brexit supporters.\nHe added: \"The SNP are using the EU as their excuse to call another independence vote but won't guarantee Scotland in the EU will be a result of their vote.\n\"For the SNP it is always about independence. The EU and a vote on the terms of Brexit are the latest excuses.\"", "McKee said attending a youth drama group in her home town of Peterlee, County Durham, \"changed my life\".\n\"Particularly in today's climate of austerity, it deeply concerns me that this kind of work must continue to be funded,\" she said.\nShe was speaking at the launch of a 15-year cultural strategy for the region.\nTitled The Case For Culture, it aims to get 500,000 more people - including 285,000 more children - involved in the arts in the north-east by 2030.\nIt also hopes to increase investment in the arts in the area from \u00c2\u00a3100m to \u00c2\u00a3300m over the next five years.\nThe strategy has been co-ordinated by Ros Rigby, who now works at the Sage concert hall in Gateshead - but who organised the Peterlee Youth Drama Workshop when McKee was a member in the late 1970s.\nMcKee said: \"I had no idea what a youth drama workshop was.

I think it would be very difficult for any doctor to take part in treating a patient without valid consent and this would invalidate their consent if it was linked to conditionality to benefits. After all, it would not be effective - we know coerced treatments tend not to work.\"\nLabour said that despite the government's rhetoric fewer than one in ten sick and disabled people on the government's flagship welfare-to-work scheme had found permanent employment.\nAnd the Lib Dems said those suffering from such illnesses needed to be shown more compassion.\n\"It is entirely right we make sure people suffering alcohol, drug or weight-related problems get effective help and support.

They are putting the benefits at risk. Their proposed deal, whereby Britain would somehow retain access to the single market without obeying any of the rules, is a fantasy.\"\nIn response, Robert Oxley from the Vote Leave campaign said: \"I think this is just further scaremongering from the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign which ignores the cost of the EU.\"\nBritain Stronger in Europe said one piece of research showed UK goods trade with the EU was 55% higher because of EU membership.\nTheir claim is based on research by the Centre for European Reform that was first published in January 2014.\nThe research used a statistical model to estimate how much extra trading of goods the UK does with other EU members, than would be expected without the single market.\nVote Leave said it was \"out of date research from a pro-EU think tank\".\nVote Leave used research from Civitas to support its case.\nCivitas studied official trade statistics and said that Britain had recorded slower export growth than any of the other founding nations of Europe's single market.\nMichael Burrage, who wrote the report, said: \"While the single market cannot be counted a success in export terms for the EU as a whole, for the UK it must be counted at the very least a massive disappointment, and not far short of a disaster.\"\nHis report found growth in UK exports had tended to drop after European Commission trade deals, whereas independent countries Switzerland, Singapore and South Korea increased exports in the majority of cases after they negotiated their own trade agreements.\nMr Burrage added that UK export growth was 22.3% lower since joining the single market at the end of 1992 than it would have been had it continued at its rate during the common market between 1973 and 1992.\nVote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott said: \"The unquestioning mantra that the single market has been good for British trade is wrong and should be challenged as this research makes crystal clear.\"\nMeanwhile, pharmaceutical executives warned that a British exit from the EU could isolate the country's scientists and reduce its influence in medicine.\nJohn Lechleiter, chief executive of the US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly, told the Financial Times it would be a \"shame and a mistake\" if the UK left the EU, adding a vote to leave would \"isolate the UK, to its detriment\".\nThe boss of Unilever, Paul Polman, said the consumer goods giant would not scale back its 7,500 UK jobs in the case of an \"out\" vote, but he did feel the UK had \"got a lot of benefit from the union\".\nMr Polman told the Guardian it would be \"very good\" if Britain voted to stay in the EU.\nDavid Cameron last week urged business leaders who want Britain to remain in a reformed EU not to \"hold back\".\nReferendum timeline: What will happen when?\nGuide: All you need to know about the referendum\nQ&A: What does Britain want from Europe?\nMore: BBC News EU referendum special", "The visitors were bowled out for just 177 in their first innings with Harvey Hosein's unbeaten 27 the top score.\nCraig Meschede (3-33) claimed three top-order victims, with all six Glamorgan bowlers taking wickets.\nDerbyshire showed more resistance second time around, reaching the close at Colwyn Bay on 78-1.\nGlamorgan remain strong favourites with two days remaining, with young spinners Andrew Salter and Owen Morgan claiming two wickets each in their first Championship match bowling together, while Mark Wallace claimed five catches behind the stumps.\nDerbyshire wicketkeeper Hosein did emergency opening duty in the second innings, making 26, with captain Billy Godleman away through illness.\nHe is likely to retain his place for the rest of the season after news of Tom Poynton's enforced retirement at the age of 26 as a result of an ankle injury sustained in a car crash.\nGlamorgan all-rounder Craig Meschede told BBC Wales Sport: \"I think the game's going very well, it's in Glamorgan's hands, the boys have toiled really hard to force the follow-on.\n\"Without a doubt it's been the best Championship performance since we haven't started too well in this competition, but we've been playing well leading up to this game and it's nice to see the rewards.\"\nDerbyshire head coach John Sadler told BBC Radio Derby: \"There's always hope, we're quite a long way behind in the game at the minute but we know that if we play as we can, we might be able to put them under a bit of pressure on the last day.\n\"We know we've under-performed so far with the bat with too many soft dismissals, but we've got another chance to put it right.\n\"I can't speak highly enough of Tom Poynton on and off the field, when you look back, for him to work as hard as he did over that year to get back onto the pitch  and play first-class cricket again, credit to him for working so hard - it was an achievement in itself.\"", "State-run KCNA news agency made no specific announcement of his appointment. Instead, in characteristic North Korean style, his name appeared in lists of attendees at a visit by Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un to military manoeuvres on Sunday.\nHowever, there were clues to his return to high rank nearly two weeks ago, when he was seen at the official event marking the launch of North Korea's latest ballistic missile.\nHe was spotted standing in the position on the leadership platform previously filled by Ri Yong-gil exactly a month earlier, when North Korea marked its latest nuclear test.\nGen Ri is an experienced hand in North Korean politics. He was an aide to former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and the head of the Ministry for People's Security, making him a member of the \"Gang of Three\", a group of officials that is always present in the leader's entourage.\nHis date of birth is disputed, with official accounts saying he was born in 1934 (putting his age at 82), while others claim he was born in either 1937 or 1938.\nSouth Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo describes him as an \"octogenarian apparatchik\" and \"yet another sign that hardline dinosaurs are currently in the ascendant in internal power struggles\".\nIt adds that Gen Ri is the fifth chief of general staff since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011, claiming that two of his predecessors were executed, one died in post and another was purged.\nGen Ri is regarded as a leading military strategist; the Defensenews website says he is \"well-versed\" in missile technology.\nNorth Korea's official biography of Gen Ri claims his military career started in 1950 during the Korean War, which would have made him between 12 and 16 years of age at the time, depending on which account of his life is accurate.\nHe was promoted to colonel general in 1995, and to full general five years later. Gen Ri was elected to the party's central committee in 2010.\nFollowing the elder Kim's death he was removed from several of his ministerial, party and National Defence Commission posts in 2013, but has now apparently fallen back into favour after three years out of the public eye.\nBBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

France offered almost nothing despite their numerical advantage, while two first-half missed penalties from James Hook were also critical in the final analysis.\nWith a heavy rainstorm hitting Eden Park just before kick-off both sides struggled to control the ball in the early stages, spilling possession deep in each other's 22m.\nBut it was Wales who got on the board first when Hook landed a beautifully-judged penalty from the right touchline after France captain Thierry Dusautoir had gone offside at a ruck, although the departure through injury of tight-head Adam Jones - replaced by Paul James - quietened the noisy Celts in the crowd.\nHook then missed a far straighter penalty from 40m after his standing foot slipped, but Wales then set up camp deep in the French half, Roberts smashing through the defensive line only to hit Jonathan Davies in the face with a pass that could have put his fellow centre in.\nThe game then turned on a hugely controversial call from referee Alain Rolland. Warburton, so impressive throughout the tournament, lifted Vincent Clerc off his feet with a big hit and then turned him in the air, leaving the Frenchman crashing onto his back.\nWe just feel like the destiny of the result was taken out of our hands with the red card\nRead more Wales reaction\nRolland had no hesitation in pulling out his red card, stunning both Warburton and the crowd, but from the stands the tackle looked more misjudgement than malicious - a yellow card and no more at such an early stage of such a big contest.\nParra's subsequent penalty levelled the scores, and it then took desperate Welsh defence to keep out first Jean-Baptiste Poux and then Maxime Mermoz.\nHook had another chance from distance but again missed to the right, Parra nailing a simpler penalty from 35m to put Les Bleus 6-3 up with the interval approaching.\nSomehow Wales were still pressing, the outstanding Toby Faletau battering off a scrum to set up good field position only for Hook to mis-hit his attempted drop-goal under pressure.\nThe red card had sucked all the life and passion from the capacity ground, and as both sides restricted themselves to kicking for territory after the break the atmosphere remained curiously flat.\nWales coach Warren Gatland opted to replace the disappointing Hook with the 102-cap experience of Stephen Jones after 45 minutes as his side sought to get some sort of grip on the game.\nFrance, their forwards keeping it tight, began to put the denuded Welsh defence under increasing pressure. Relentless tackling protected the try-line but when a rolling maul from a line-out was taken down, Parra popped over a simple penalty for 9-3.\nWales were pinned deep in their own half, forced to kick away any possession, and with 25 minutes left it was hard to see any way back for them.\nThen Phillips, just as he had against Ireland in the quarter-final, took the match by the scruff of the neck.\nAfter powerful rumbles from his forwards, the scrum-half spotted a gap between the two French locks and accelerated through and away for the first try of the match.\nJones had the chance to put Wales in an unlikely lead but missed the straightforward conversion to leave it 8-9 going into a tumultuous final quarter.\nMost close-fought contests have their fair share of almosts and nearlys.

Mr Musharraf left the country in 2008 under the shadow of impeachment after losing power in elections.\nDuring his time in self-imposed exile in London and Dubai, the former president is believed to have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars on worldwide lecture tours. But he has never made any secret that his main ambition was to return to power in his homeland.\nAlmost everyone agreed that would not be easy, as his struggle to find a seat in which to contest the elections showed.\nBy contrast with his political rivals he has negligible grassroots support.\nMany of his assets in Pakistan - including cash and property - were confiscated in 2011.\nFurthermore it seems increasingly clear that the army - on whose support he relied during his time in power - is reluctant to see him re-enter the political fray.\nAnd there are at least four criminal investigations against him, as well as the treason charge.\nHis decision to support President Bush in 2001 inevitably meant that he would end up clashing with militants sympathetic to the Taliban and al-Qaeda.\nPerhaps the most powerful manifestation of this change of direction came in July 2007, when the president ordered his security forces to storm the Red Mosque with its adjacent Islamic school in Islamabad, resulting in the deaths of more than 100 people.\nClerics and students of the mosque were accused of waging an increasingly aggressive campaign to enforce a strict interpretation of Sharia law in Pakistan's capital.\nIn the weeks after the mosque was seized, clashes between soldiers and Islamist militants in the country's northern tribal regions escalated and suicide bombings - a rarity in Pakistan - became much more commonplace.\nHis time in power was also marked by struggles with the judiciary, including an attempt to remove the chief justice and protracted disputes over his oft-stated desire to remain head of the army while simultaneously being president of Pakistan.\nThe president was often described as walking a tightrope as he has sought to balance pressure from the US to crack down on extremism in Pakistan and the demands from an increasingly vocal and anti-American Islamist constituency.\nRelations with India, meanwhile, worsened in 2001 after militants allegedly based in Pakistan attacked the Indian parliament.\nBy the summer of 2002 the two countries appeared to be on the brink of war with more than a million troops massed along both sides of the Line of Control that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir.\nThen Afghanistan began to loom large.\nMr Musharraf was frequently accused by Nato and the Afghan government of not doing enough to stem the movement of militants sympathetic to al-Qaeda and the Taliban from Pakistan's tribal areas into Afghanistan.\nAt one point some in the West even questioned Mr Musharraf's usefulness in the \"war on terror\", strongly criticising his policy of signing local peace agreements with militants in the north-west of the country.\nHis constant refrain was that he was the first Pakistani leader to target al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Pakistan's history.\nHe also fought nationalists in the province of Balochistan and had to deal with increased sectarian violence between hardline Sunni and Shia groups.\nInitially, he oversaw an improvement in economic growth, but in the latter part of his time in power Pakistan's finances were not considered to be especially healthy.\nAt the same time he faced an increasing number of challenges on the domestic front, culminating with the return of one of his main political enemies, Nawaz Sharif, to Pakistan from exile in 2007.\nIt marked the beginning of the end of his time in power.\nThe tables have now turned -

But what is it that the fans love so much?\nMusical theatre superfan Keith Milward, from Swansea, says it's that tale of romance that got him hook, line and sinker.\n\"It's such a great story. It has just got everything you want and even across the generations people have always responded to the loveliness of it.\"\nThe seemingly innocent and wholesome plotline sees young nun Maria sent out of her convent to be the governess of the seven cute von Trapp children.\nA few Do-Re-Mis later and Maria and the children's navy captain father, played by Christopher Plummer, have fallen in love. But then they have to flee the Nazis during the annexation of Austria.\nSo far, so gloriously far-fetched, you might think. But actually the story was based on the memoir of the real-life Maria von Trapp. Published in 1949, the book was later turned into a stage musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein before the film came along in 1965.\nYou would think even the hardest of souls would be softened by such a hefty dose of syrupy sentimentality but reviews at the time were lukewarm.\nCritics were keen to point out the historical inaccuracies of the film, claiming it glossed over Austria's role in World War Two. One eminent critic, Pauline Kael, condemned it as a \"sugar-coated lie that people seem to want to eat\".\nSource: IMDB / Official Charts\nBut current film critic Richard Fitzwilliam says audiences completely disagreed.\n\"There was just something so romantic about it. Musical films were really taking off and people liked seeing them on the wide-screen. It was completely different to the swords and sandals epics that were also popular at the time but it was just pure escapism. It was also perfect for families to watch together.\n\"Some said it was too schmaltzy and sentimental but it was hugely successful.\"\nSo while the film might score few points for factual accuracy, it's not the nuances of the plotline that has kept fans entertained for over five decades. It's the songs.\nThe Sound of Music soundtrack album was the UK's best-selling LP, not just in 1965, but in 1966 and 1968.\n\"They are just so infuriatingly hummable,\" Richard Fitzwilliam says. \"Just talking about the film,  I can hear the songs like the Lonely Goatherd, Sixteen Going on Seventeen and I'm tapping along and mumbling the lyrics.\"\n\"It's like a test,\" Keith Milward says. \"You can say to anyone in the street 'Do a deer, a female deer' and they'd know the tune and respond with the next line.\n\"Even the most cynical will be swayed once they hear the music. I saw a touring production of it at the Swansea Grand just a couple of weeks ago and everyone was singing along.\n\"The BBC even said that, should the end of the world be on its way, they would play the Sound of Music, so they must have thought it would brighten even the darkest of days.\"\nAnd it seems that might be true... to some extent. It is believed that, at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film was selected by TV executives to be broadcast as part of a series of recorded programming in the event of a nuclear strike.\nIn 2006, the master of the musicals, Lord Lloyd-Webber, brought the story right back into the popularity stakes with a TV contest to find an undiscovered performer to play Maria in a new West End production.\nMeanwhile, a sing-a-long version of the film still attracts hundreds of people every month. At the Prince Charles Cinema in London, fans turn up dressed as nuns and von Trapp children ready to sing their hearts out.\nMany fans hope the original film won't be subjected to a Hollywood remake.  \"It shouldn't be touched,\" Fitzwilliam says. \"There are so many enduring memories that come with it and the original is still so good.\"\nSo good indeed that last year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the cult classic, Lady Gaga took to the stage at the Oscar's to belt out a Sound of Music medley.\nFor those still not convinced, you may be pleased to hear that actor Christopher Plummer was for many years unimpressed by the film that he became well-known for, famously referring to it as the \"Sound of Mucus\". But despite his misgivings, even he can understand its enduring appeal.\nLast year he told Vanity Fair magazine: \"As cynical as I always was about The Sound of Music, I do respect that it is a bit of relief from all the gunfire and car chases you see these days.\n\"It's sort of wonderfully, old-fashionedly universal. It's got the bad guys and the Alps; it's got Julie and sentiment in bucketloads.

Ms Hoole believes Ava's story has become largely forgotten.\nThe archaeologist has set up a website dedicated to new research on the bones, a decorated beaker buried with the woman and the Middle Bronze Age burial site, which lies close to the A9 between Latheron and Thurso.\nTests already done on the remains suggest the woman was aged 18 to 22 when she died.\nShe was buried in an unmarked rock-cut pit rather than underneath a cairn or in a pit dug into soil, which are the most commonly discovered burial sites from the Bronze Age.\nMs Hoole said she was only aware of a handful of other pits dug into solid rock that have been found in Scotland.\nShe said: \"A lot of time and energy was invested in this burial.\n\"It just makes you wonder - why go to all that effort? What was so unique about the individual buried here to receive such special treatment?\"\nThe decoration on the beaker found with Ava appears to be unique, the archaeologist said.\nShe said: \"I've looked far and wide for comparable examples, but there's nothing else out there quite like it, again making this burial significant.\n\"I have closely examined the beaker decoration and discovered that at least three different tools were used to create the design, likely meaning that the artist had a specially-made tool kit and was prepared and likely experienced.\"\nMs Hoole added: \"Like many others, I'm sure, I find skeletal remains completely mesmerising.\n\"The evidence shows that this was a young female, aged between 18 and 22, but we have no evidence of cause of death.\nSince she was discovered in the 1980s we have made great advances in technology and it makes you wonder what we could still learn from her. I've been working on recreating the lost site plans, and interpreting the position this individual was buried in.\n\"My interpretation suggests that the layout of the burial fits into a much wider trend extending as far south as North Yorkshire, and possibly much further beyond.\"\nWhat is known about Ava is that she was part of a much wider European group known as the Beaker people.\nShort and round skull shapes were common amongst this group, but Ms Hoole said the Achavanich specimen is exaggerated and of an abnormal, uneven shape.\nThe archaeologist said: \"There has been much debate amongst the archaeological community for many decades about the shape. Some argue it is a hereditary trait, whilst others think there may have been a practice of head-binding which creates the distinct shape.\n\"Perhaps this site can contribute more to the debate if further research is undertaken.\"\nShe added: \"She has been fondly nicknamed 'Ava', an abbreviation of the place she was found.\n\"Although potentially a controversial decision, I want people to remember that this is not just a cluster of bones, but that she was once a human being, with a name, an identity and a place in a long lost community.\"", "The new deal means the 30-year-old full-back will remain in Inverness until the summer of 2017.\nTremarco joined the Highlanders in July 2013 after spells at Tranmere Rovers, Wrexham, Darlington and Macclesfield.\n\"Carl is a great player with a great attitude and it's good to get him signed up for another year,\" said Caley Thistle manager John Hughes.\n\"There's other players who we've also made offers to and hopefully we can get some more sorted soon.\"", "A concerned neighbour called police to report domestic violence.\nPolice officers who arrived at the property also heard screaming coming from inside.\nWhen they tried to break in, the man, wearing headphones, came to the door.\nIt happened on Tuesday in Buitenveldert, a southern area of Amsterdam.\nPolice released details of the incident in a Facebook post.

He also put a header wide of the post.\nThere were sporadic flashes from Faissal El Bakhtaoui, who won the free-kick from which Tom Hateley grazed the bar. It was probably always going to take time for El Bakhtaoui to make the step up, and he is not there yet.\nDundee, to their great credit, hit the woodwork four times - Hateley twice, Teijsse and Gadzhalov once.\nIf you are struggling to score goals, you can at least tighten up at the back. Dundee started with a back three which at times was more of a back five.\nOverall Dundee looked pretty solid, until Hearts finally found a way through. Kevin Gomis was not perfect but overall he provided a commanding presence at the back. He looks like a top signing by Hartley.\nBut Dundee need goals, simple as that.\nHearts boss Robbie Neilson: \"A good three points, tough game. I thought we created a lot of good chances, but didn't take them which was frustrating.\n\"Dundee had a period when they were on top and pretty dominant, hit the woodwork a couple of times and it became end to end.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"We made a couple of changes, brought Robbie Muirhead on and he changed the game for us to be honest. He gave us energy, great delivery and allowed us to get a bit more width which I think was key to the game.\"\nDundee manager Paul Hartley: \"It was a good performance from the players. I thought we were terrific. We should have taken something from the game.\n\"The amount of chances we created, the set-piece delivery was brilliant and we just weren't clinical enough.\"\nMatch ends, Heart of Midlothian 2, Dundee 0.\nSecond Half ends, Heart of Midlothian 2, Dundee 0.\nFoul by Jamie Walker (Heart of Midlothian).\nPaul McGowan (Dundee) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\nIgor Rossi (Heart of Midlothian) wins a free kick in the attacking half.\nFoul by Faissal El Bakhtaoui (Dundee).\nAttempt saved.

The flats of at least seven activists who work for Mr Khodorkovsky were also searched.\nMr Khodorkovsky has always argued that the fraud charges for which he was imprisoned were politically motivated.\nThe exiled tycoon, who now spends much of his time in London. has repeatedly criticised President Putin in recent months. He said Tuesday's raids were acts of intimidation and the sign of an \"authoritarian regime\" nearing its \"inevitable\" end.\nIn further comments on Wednesday, Mr Khodorkovsky said the authorities were acting like bandits: \"They've gone mad. I realised that yesterday.\"\nAfter Mr Khodorkovsky was arrested in 2003, Yukos was broken up and taken over by a state oil firm. Last year an international arbitration court in The Hague said Russian officials had manipulated the legal system to bankrupt Yukos, and jail Mikhail Khodorkovsky.\nThe court told Russia to pay former shareholders in Yukos $50bn (\u00c2\u00a332bn) in compensation.\n1963 - Born in Moscow, son of chemical engineers\n1987 - Founds Menatep bank\n1995 - Buys Yukos for $350m, with Menatep assuming $2bn in debt\n2003 - Arrested for tax evasion, embezzlement and fraud\n2005 - Found guilty on six of seven charges, jailed for eight years\n2007 - Yukos declared bankrupt\n2010 - Convicted of embezzlement and money laundering\n2013 - Pardoned by President Putin after request for clemency;

Leaving Europe would have a profound impact on our economy for generations to come, so I refuse to accept that British business should be a silent partner in this debate.\"\nCBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said: \"The majority of CBI members want the UK to be in a reformed EU - changing it for the better, not just for the UK but for all member states... there are several areas where the EU needs to raise its game. Businesses want to see more trade deals, completion of the single market and less red tape.\"\nThe Institute of Directors urged businesses not to \"bury their heads in the sand\" over the EU referendum and had \"a duty to their shareholders, employees and customers to be discussing the implications of the vote at the most senior levels\".\nReferendum timeline: What will happen when?\nGuide: All you need to know about the referendum\nQ&A: What does Britain want from Europe?\nMore: BBC News EU referendum special", "The Lionhearts, beaten in last year's final by Cuba, went down 3-2 in Rome.\nFlyweight Galal Yafai beat Federico Serra and Dalton Smith defeated light-welterweight Paolo di Lernia.\nBut there were defeats for Jack Bateson, Josip-Bepo Filipi and Luka Plantic as all the bouts went to points.\nBantamweight Bateson was beaten by Francesco Maietta, Plantic lost his middleweight clash with Salvatore Cavallaro and heavyweight Filipi was outpointed by London 2012 Olympic silver medallist Clemente Russo.", "The 29-year-old, who is currently in Rio hosting coverage of the Olympic Games, said he was \"a huge fan\" of the show and \"cannot wait to get started\".\n\"I'm still waiting for someone to wake me up and tell me I'm dreaming!

The Senate investigated and in April 1974 President Nixon released edited tapes of his conversations about Watergate. In July the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee approved impeachment.\nIn August, Nixon admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry. Four days later, he became the only US president to resign.\nBut are there really parallels between the Trump administration's alleged links to Russia and what happened 45 years ago?\nOne similarity is that the DNC, the target of the Watergate break-in, was also targeted in last year's US election campaign, when emails were stolen and leaked.\nUS intelligence agencies say Russia was behind the DNC hack, though Russia denies any involvement.\nRussia is believed to have wanted Mr Trump to win the election. An unverified report apparently compiled by a private intelligence firm claimed Russia had compromising information on Mr Trump and was in a position to blackmail him.\nSome commentators - including former President George W Bush's ethics lawyer Richard Painter - now fear the Russian connection could make Watergate seem trivial.\n\"The facts now in this investigation are much worse than the facts in the early stages of Watergate, which was a simple break-in ordered by mid-level campaign officials - not by the president,\" Mr Painter told Vox.\n\"Here we have facts that are much worse: We have a foreign power that has orchestrated a break in. It's a much worse situation than the outset of Watergate.\"\nThe alleged falsehood told by Mr Sessions has also fired up Watergate comparisons.\nOne of Mr Nixon's attorney generals, John Mitchell, was later jailed for offences including perjury for his role in the scandal.\nHis replacement Richard Kleindienst was not implicated in Watergate but pleaded guilty in 1974 to failing to testify fully to the Senate about favouritism shown to a communications company during his confirmation hearing.\n\"It's pretty clear listening to his testimony that [Sessions] certainly wasn't truthful when he was before the Senate and I don't think that's simply going to disappear because he's recused himself from partaking in any of the investigation as attorney general. That's going to continue,\" Mr Dean said.\n\"These eerie echoes of Watergate keep coming,\" he added.\nMr Sessions is now facing calls for him to quit over his recently-admitted contact with Sergei Kislyak - the same Russian official whose phone calls with Mr Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Mr Flynn's resignation last month.\nMr Flynn's exit prompted veteran journalist Dan Rather to say on Facebook: \"Watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime, until maybe now.\"\nIt is alleged that Mr Flynn discussed diplomatic issues with Mr Kislyak before assuming his role at the White House. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy.\nSome commentators are now calling for a Watergate-style bipartisan Senate select committee to investigate links between Mr Trump's administration and Russia.\n\"I would immediately get a special prosecutor on the case,\" said Mr Dean.\nMr Trump's January dismissal of the previous attorney general Sally Yates also led to comparison's with Nixon's infamous \"Saturday night massacre\" during Watergate in 1973, when he fired an independent special prosecutor, triggering the resignations of attorney general Elliot Richardson and his deputy Gen William Ruckelshouse.\nNixon and Mr Trump are believed to be the only US presidents to have dismissed an attorney general.", "Paignton Zoo said treating the three-month-old male calf would have been prolonged and stressful.\nThe condition - discospondylitis -  is usually caused by infection and, even after treatment, the giraffe would have had a \"potentially painful neck\".\nPaignton Zoo said it was a difficult decision, but the right thing to do.\nThe giraffe, which was born in May and had not been named, had been bottle fed by zoo staff after it was rejected by its mother.\nIt was hoped concern about its neck would resolve as the calf grew, but it became more apparent over the past two weeks.\n\u2022The species is identified by its broader dividing white lines and no spots beneath the knees\n\u2022Classed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature\n\u2022Native to Kenya, Uganda and Sudan\n\u2022In the past, giraffes were hunted for their tails, which were used as good-luck charms, sewing thread and even fly swats\nCurator of Mammals, Neil Bemment, said the giraffe had been resting his head on the zoo fence so had been put on painkillers \"as a precaution\" while  X-rays were arranged.\n\"He'd started to develop a distinct kink in his neck and X-rays showed that at least two of his vertebrae joints were collapsing,\" Mr Bemment said.\n\"Treatment would be prolonged and stressful and he would still be left with a bent and potentially painful neck which would become accentuated as he got older and his neck grew proportionally longer.\"\nRothschild's are one of the most endangered species of giraffes, with only a few hundred left in the wild.\nIn June last year, a one-month-old Rothschild's calf was put to sleep after keepers found it collapsed in its stall.\nThe zoo said although discospondylitis is a known condition, it is not common and it is the first instance of it at Paignton Zoo.", "Mr Hammond said the government would not \"lie down\" and would \"do whatever we have to do\" to remain competitive.\nHe had been asked by a German newspaper if the UK could become a \"tax haven\" by further lowering corporation tax.\nLabour's Jeremy Corbyn said his comments sounded like \"a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe\".\nHaving so far refused to offer a \"running commentary\" on her plans, Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to spell out the most detail so far of her Brexit strategy in a speech on Tuesday.\nReports have suggested she will signal pulling out of the EU single market and customs union, although Downing Street described this as \"speculation\".\nIn an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Mr Hammond said he was \"optimistic\" a reciprocal deal on market access could be struck, and that he hoped the UK would \"remain in the mainstream of European economic and social thinking\".\n\"But if we are forced to be something different, then we will have to become something different,\" he said.\n\"If we have no access to the European market, if we are closed off, if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement on market access, then we could suffer from economic damage at least in the short-term.\n\"In this case, we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness. And you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do.\n\"The British people are not going to lie down and say, too bad, we've been wounded. We will change our model, and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged.\"\nAsked about Mr Hammond's comments during an interview on The Andrew Marr Show Mr Corbyn said \"He appears to be making a sort of threat to EU community saying 'well, if you don't give us exactly what we want, we are going to become this sort of strange entity on shore of Europe where there'll be very low levels of corporate taxation, and designed to undermine the effectiveness or otherwise of industry across Europe.'\n\"It seems to me a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future. That really isn't a very sensible way forward.\"\nMr Corbyn also said Mrs May \"appears to be heading us in the direction of a sort of bargain basement economy\", adding: \"It seems to me an extremely risky strategy.\"\nby BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam\nAccording to Philip Hammond, Britain might be \"forced\" to change its economic model. To what?\nFor some, the true advantage of leaving the EU would be to tear up the 'rules' and make Britain more like Singapore.\nSingapore abides by World Trade Organisation and ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) trade rules, but it's famed for its light touch regulation - especially when it comes to financial services - which some Brexiteers feel is the opposite of EU \"meddling\".\nBut turning a large G7 economy with a robust social model into a city state might be difficult. It might involve the government handpicking which industries it thinks will be successes and rapidly neglecting existing sectors.\nMillions of people would need to get brand new qualifications while those with undesirable skills would become surplus to requirements. Massive infrastructure projects might be rushed through with minimal consultation.\nFor a country with Britain's past and present, is that a possible future?\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it appeared Brexit would mean a \"low-tax, deregulated race to the bottom\", with workers' rights and environmental protections threatened.\nShe wrote on Twitter: \"If that is the case, it raises a more fundamental question - not just are we in/out EU, but what kind of country do we want to be?\"\nIn her speech on Tuesday, the prime minister is expected to call on the country to \"put an end to the division\" created by the EU referendum result.\nShe will urge the UK to leave behind words such as \"Leaver and Remainer and all the accompanying insults and unite to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain\".\nSeveral of Sunday's newspapers claim Mrs May will outline a \"hard Brexit\" approach, a term used to imply prioritising migration controls over single market access.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not think it was a \"binary choice\" between trade and migration, but added that the \"very stark message\" from the EU referendum was that \"free movement as it exists today cannot continue in to the future\".\nSpeaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said a \"hard Brexit\" had not been on the ballot paper in June's referendum and accused the PM of adopting \"the Nigel Farage vision\" of Brexit.\nMr Farage, the former UKIP leader, told Sky News he had \"yet to be convinced\" by the PM's approach.", "The loan window for Football League clubs opened seven days later, while any club can sign unattached players if they left their old clubs before the deadline.\nBiggest signing in the

safeguard public health.\nThe Welsh Government said smoking was the biggest single case of early death in Wales, with almost 6,000 deaths annually, and the sale of illegal tobacco undermined work to reduce smoking rates.\nIt added it also compromised current tobacco control measures such as age-of-sale legislation, labelling and the ban on having tobacco on display in shops.\nMr Drakeford said: \"I am very concerned about illegal tobacco because its affordability and availability threatens the health of children, making it so much easier for them to access tobacco. It also eliminates the price incentive for smokers to quit the habit.\n\"This is not a Robin Hood crime. It is criminality which deprives the public of vital revenue which is used to fund essential public and health services, including tackling the damaging impacts of tobacco itself but its effects extend far beyond that.\"\nMatthew Cridland, chairman of the Wales heads of trading standards, said figures showed 15% of tobacco used in Wales was illegal -

the Primary Stars scheme is the latest in a long line of community projects supported by football. \"The clubs have been doing all this for over 20 years,\" he said.\n\"They have huge involvement in their local communities, and yet the message never gets across.\"\nHowever, he stressed top-flight clubs are not seeking \"credit\" by getting involved in the project.\nPremier League Primary Stars will provide free resources linked to the national curriculum to boys and girls aged five to 11.\nAfter the initial reach, Scudamore says he hopes the scheme will extend to every primary school in England and Wales by 2022.\nThe initiative will supply free to download lesson plans, activities and video content in Maths, English, Physical Education (PE) and Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE).\nScudamore added that schools located close to professional football teams could also benefit from club coaches coming into schools to assist with PE lessons.\nThe programme aims to use the appeal of Premier League clubs \"to inspire children to learn, be active and develop important life skills\" - an impact Scudamore says the clubs already see in their involvement in community projects.\n\"We do an awful lot of this anyway - the clubs have been doing a lot of work in communities, a lot of our clubs are involved in schools, not just Premier League clubs but English Football League clubs too,\" he said.\n\"Nobody out there really knows -

if we trusted him, and it worked both ways, then the chances were there that we could become a professional footballer.\"\nMr Radford also described a sexual assault which he said took place after he had developed a back injury and was asked to lie down for treatment.\nJamie Webb, who joined the club when he was 13, described how boys were \"groomed\" by the club employee who asked them to write him \"love\" letters.\nRecalling a \"definite attempt to abuse me\", Mr Webb said: \"I recall clearly he tried to move down and put his hand in between my shorts and my tracksuit that I was wearing and I just blocked him.\"\nHe said the experiences \"tarnished\" his memories of his time at the club and Mr Radford said he held the club \"partly responsible\" for the abuse.\nMr Radford said: \"They must have known, they must have heard these rumours going around because everybody else had.\"\nThe two men waived their anonymity to speak to the BBC.\nBBC South has also spoken to other former Southampton players who have come forward with allegations of abuse.\nMr Radford said he had the \"utmost respect\" for other ex-footballers who have spoken out about being abused.\nHe said: \"You don't live every day of your life crying your eyes out and walking around with your head down, you get on with life as normal, but you still have it there, it's buried there deep, and it comes up, and it will keep coming up for the rest of my life.\"\nMr Radford said if his parents had known at the time they would have stopped the abuse.\nHampshire Constabulary is one of 15 police forces investigating allegations of abuse in football.\nIt comes as the NSPCC said its hotline -

Some of the forwards were outstanding.\"\nThe hosts looked to be seriously up against it when Isa and Cordero scored either side of the break against 13 men after Daly's dismissal and a yellow for Dan Cole.\nJones' men dug in and managed to resist a tiring Argentina for the rest of the game. They even began to gain the upper hand in the scrum with Farrell kicking two further penalties before May ran in the corner after George Ford, Tom Wood and Jonathan Joseph drew tackles to release the Gloucester man.\nDespite the Daly red, it had looked like it would be a more straightforward victory when referee Pascal Gauzere awarded England a penalty try just before the half hour after Matias Orlando deliberately knocked forward a Chris Robshaw pass with Wood poised to score.\nA key passage of the match came at the end of the first half as Argentina's pack laid siege to the England line with the hosts forced to concede a succession of penalties.\nThe visitors decided to pass up the opportunity for an easy three points and opted for repeated scrums. As the penalties accumulated, England lost Billy Vunipola to injury and Cole to the sin-bin as Gauzere lost patience with the repeat offending.\nWith the half in its 48th minute, replacement flanker Isa eventually picked up and drove through scrum-half Ben Youngs to give Argentina a huge boost going into the belated break.\nHolding a two-man advantage, they went for the jugular at the start of the second half, moving the ball across the field to Estelles. The winger drew in Mike Brown on the left flank and quick passes sent Cordero clear under the posts.\nThe gap was suddenly down to two points and Jones' 100% winning record looked in danger, but the hosts dominated once Cole returned to the field.\n\"The way we adapted our tactics and coped with the problems was tremendous,\" said Jones. \"It is credit to our strength and conditioning staff to get the players to the level of fitness they showed in the last 20 minutes.\n\"I think we won the match before half-time. The way we held on with those scrums was superb. It was 15 men against 13 but we coped.\"\nThe match ended as it began with Gauzere showing another red card, this time to Argentina's Pieretto who stamped on fellow replacement Marler after the England prop held on to him.\nMarler was shown a yellow for his part in the incident.\nFormer England captain Lewis Moody on BBC Two\nGoing down to 14 men, England will be very happy to come out with a win. They did it in the end and had to absorb pressure but took the penalties that were on offer.\nEngland have been on a fantastic run and could end up equalling the team of 2002-2003. This group has so much building to do, there is so much more to come.\nThey will beat Australia next week, they are so confident and can take a lot out of this.\nEngland end their autumn campaign with the visit of Australia next Saturday (14:30 GMT), looking to make it four wins in four weeks.\n\"We are looking forward to Australia next week.
