She said she was \"flabbergasted by the depth and quality\" of the archive rescued from the Charrington skip.\n\"I couldn't believe it was just going to be thrown away,\" she said.\nPete Boswell, managing director of digital specialists Photo Legacy, spent four and a half months digitising the photographs in the collection.\nHe hopes to work on bringing more old images of pubs to life.\n\"They're very interesting, and they have an appeal to many different types of people,\" he said.\n\"I'll certainly be working with other collections that aren't held by the trust. We've had some very good conversations, and I'm confident that we will be seeing more soon.\"\nThe project is set to continue into next year, having secured funding from Amsterdam-based cultural heritage group Europeana Food and Drink, and Ms Schauer hopes visitors to the Historypin collection will add more historical photos to the site.\n\"We'd like to improve on what we've got - anything that makes the metadata richer would be great,\" she said.\n\"Pubs attract a lot of different types of people, they're a hub that a lot of people want to try and save.\"\nMs Schauer has high hopes the Charrington photos can lead to a bigger social history project detailing the history of thousands of British institutions.\n\"This whole project was about how we can get this archive sitting in a box in Burton and open it up to people,\" she said.\n\"Everyone has their own experience of a pub, and it's easier to unlock life stories by starting there.\"", "Jean Watson was struck as she cycled near her home on the A752 Cumbernauld Road in Chryston, North Lanarkshire, on Thursday.\nThe 31-year-old woman driving the grey Citroen car was not hurt.\nA spokesman for Police Scotland said a report would be sent to the procurator fiscal.\nSgt Craig McDonald, from the Divisional Road Policing Unit based at Motherwell, said: \"Officers have so far been unable to trace any relatives of Ms Watson, who lived in Cumbernauld Road in Chryston, and I would appeal to anyone who can assist with this matter to come forward.\n\"I would also ask anyone with information regarding Ms Watson's movements prior to the road crash to please get in touch.\"", "The Psychoactive Substances Act, which comes into force in the UK next month, makes it illegal to supply drugs which have a direct effect on mental processes, unless the drug is exempted.\nMinisters had indicated that poppers would be included in the ban.\nBut advisers say poppers have only a \"peripheral\" effect on the brain.\nAs a result, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said poppers - the name given to a group of chemicals called alkyl nitrites - \"do not fall within the scope of the current definition of a psychoactive substance\".\nThe council's guidance is contained in a letter which also sets out the harms linked to the use of poppers.\nIt says there were 11 deaths related to poppers in England and Wales from 1993 to 2013.\nIn January, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt said he used poppers and said banning supply would be \"fantastically stupid\".", "Consumer group Fairer Finance said people who paid for their funerals in advance could find their relatives faced extra costs after they died.\nIt also accused the industry of high-pressure sales tactics with vulnerable consumers, and claimed there was a danger of some firms collapsing.\nThe funeral industry itself said it was already campaigning for change.\nThe Fairer Finance study called for proper regulation of funeral plans, suggesting that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) should play a role.\nThe report was commissioned by Dignity, one of the biggest providers. It said the scale of unscrupulous sales practices in the market was significant and growing.\nHowever it also says that buying a funeral plan from a reputable provider can provide good value for money, as it locks in current prices.\nThe average cost of a pre-paid funeral plan is about \u00a34,000, according to the report.\nBut many plans do not cover costs such as embalming, limousines, a funeral service, a wake, burial plots or memorial stones.\nIn some cases, families are left having to find an extra \u00a32,000, even though they expect such items to be included.\nMany customers buying such plans are elderly or vulnerable, and will not be around to check whether the product met their expectations, Fairer Finance said.\nAs many as 1.2 million people in the UK have pre-payment plans, and the industry is growing fast - up by 350% over the last 10 years.\nSales representatives have targeted at least six million adults over the age of 50, using what the report describes as \"high-pressure\" techniques.\nSome people have been subject to aggressive telephone marketing or in-home visits, it claimed.\nIn a telephone survey, nearly half of those contacted by sales reps said they felt as if they had been \"pushed\" to buy a plan.\nIn some instances, funeral plan firms pay commissions and fees of up to \u00a31,000 for each policy sold - around a quarter of the total plan cost.\nThe report also said there was very little transparency over what happens to clients' money after they had paid it.\nThe National Association of Funeral Directors (NAFD) said it had been campaigning for tighter rules since November last year.\n\"In our view, the current lack of comprehensive oversight is allowing sharp sales practices and a lack of transparency to flourish in parts of the market,\" said Alison Crake, president of the NAFD.\n\"Members have reported numerous instances to us where funeral plan providers have not acted in the best interests of either the public who have paid for funeral plans, or the funeral directors who will care for them.\"\nThe industry is currently subject only to voluntary regulation, by the Funeral Planning Authority (FPA), and there is no ombudsman service for consumers to complain to.\nHowever, the report argues that funeral plans are financial products and should therefore be regulated by the FCA.", "General manager Kris Radlinski confirmed Burgess' exit at a fan forum.\n\"We did everything we could but he wants to experience the Sydney lifestyle,\" said Radlinski.\nBurgess, 20, scored a try in Wigan's Grand Final defeat by St Helens and was selected in England's squad for the end-of-season Four Nations tournament.\nMeanwhile, 19-year-old prop Ryan Sutton and 22-year-old half-back Sam Powell have agreed four-year contracts with the Warriors, who begin the new campaign with an away fixture at Widnes on 5 February.", "Giles suffered a hamstring strain for his region in a European Challenge Cup win over Lyon in January.\nThe Osprey was an unused replacement when Wales beat Japan in November.\n\"The intensity in training and the accuracy you need was a bit of a step up, but it was a good experience for me,\" he told BBC Wales Sport.\n\"It's a dream for every young boy [to play for Wales] so if it comes it comes and if it doesn't I'll have to work harder, but hopefully that time will come pretty soon.\"\nGiles has scored 12 tries in 11 matches for Ospreys in his first full season with the region's first team.\n\"As a winger you like to get on the end of passes and do some magic,\" he said.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\n\"It's been a good first pro season and I'm totally enjoying it and I hope there's more to come.\n\"It's obviously something I didn't really expect, but it's been nice to gel in with the team and be playing and I hope there's many more seasons to come.\n\"We play an expansive game which suits me to get the ball more and more in my hands and with the results we're getting it's working for us.\"\nGiles returned from injury in the 25-23 Pro12 defeat by Munster in February and scored in the bonus-point win over Glasgow the following week.\n\"I'm feeling good and the hamstring's good now and it's just a case of keeping on top of rehab now so I'm raring to go.\n\"It's obviously good to be back up and running and injury free and hopefully I'll get a few consistent games now and get a good run of games.\n\"If it [a Wales call-up] comes it comes, but my main focus is playing well for the Ospreys and seeing the season out,\" Giles added.\nHis Ospreys predecessor Shane Williams is among those to have backed Giles winning international honours early in his career.\n\"I've got the same physical attributes [as Shane Williams] and I was watching him scoring tries for the Ospreys and Wales growing up, so he's definitely a role model of mine.\"", "Ex-President Chen Shui-bian -

Emergency workers had just started trying to collect the dead, and hundreds of bodies lay in neat rows on the roadside.\nIt was in a makeshift camp for survivors in the grounds of a nearby mosque that I first met Mawardah Priyanka. She was 11 years old, exhausted, grimy and alone.\nHer parents had both been killed when the wave - perhaps 35m-tall when it first hit the nearby coastal village of Lampuuk - reached their home.\nIt would be days before she discovered that her big sister, Mutiyah, 16, was still alive.\nIn the months that followed, I kept in contact with the sisters as they moved from the chaotic camp to their own tent, and eventually into a new brick and wood home built for them by the British charity Oxfam.\nMawardah went back to school. Mutiyah soon got married and moved away. Another, much older sister, Ita, came to share the house at Lhoknga.\nAnd then, about eight years ago, I lost touch with them.\nIt's hard to get my bearings as I walk down what used to be a dirt track. Now it's a paved road, with a new bridge over a small stream.\nOn the right, I see a cluster of familiar buildings - concrete bases, with very simple wooden walls and tin roofs.\nSomeone shouts out that a foreigner is coming, and suddenly a tall, beaming figure is rushing out of the door.\nIt's happy, emotional - at times awkward - reunion for both of us. I'm immediately struck by how little Mawardah seems to have changed - height apart - and how much my return evidently means to her, and two days later, to her sister Mutiyah who travels in from the countryside.\nAnd I feel a rush of guilt that I didn't do more to try to stay in touch after various local and foreign contacts - who'd acted as intermediaries in the early days - left the province.\n\"There is nobody to care about me - nobody loves me like my parents,\" says Mawardah tearfully, the following day.\nThe tsunami destroyed all trace of her parents - no photos of her mother or father remain, and Ita now is preoccupied with her young family, leaving Mawardah often alone with her chores, her wooden desk and a simple mattress on a concrete bedroom floor.\nBut it soon becomes clear that the disaster has shaped Mawardah's life in other, more positive ways too.\nAt the age of 21, she is a confident, intelligent and ambitious young woman.\nShe's won several educational scholarships from a local cement factory (now restored after the tsunami), and is studying English at a private college in Banda Aceh.\nOver the next two days, as we talk in her small house, visit her school and lunch with her close circle of friends, I learn more about the trials and complexities of her life, and it strikes me that Marwadah's experiences reflect the broader circumstances of Aceh in the decade since the tsunami.\nFirst there's the house - one of 140,000 built with the staggering $7bn (\u00c2\u00a34.5bn) in international aid given to Aceh.\nMarwadah's was built quickly, and it shows. The roof leaks, its walls are flimsy, and I remember some unpleasant squabbles in the early years about which relatives would ultimately own it.\nBut the building has served its purpose, and the family readily admits it is better than the home they had before 2004.\nElsewhere, it's clear that a significant number of houses are now unoccupied - they were built in a flurry by a badly co-ordinated assortment of often competing aid agencies, flush with money and sometimes more anxious to spend it fast than to address the interests of local communities.\n\"I give the aid effort 65 (out of 100),\" says Muslahuddin Daud, a World Bank official who himself nearly drowned in the tsunami.\n\"A lot of things are not perfect: $7bn - in many ways we could do better. A lot of houses are empty... redundant. We had more than 500 aid organisations and... a lot of overlapping.\nMr Daud said too much foreign money made people feel \"entitled to get aid\" and become lazy.\n\"Aceh has got stuck in terms of growth - the ability to manage the resources is not there,\" he said.\nThen there's peace.\nBefore the tsunami, Aceh was wrestling with a violent separatist rebellion. Even as an 11-year-old, Mawardah remembers the impact it had on everyone's lives - the fear, the road blocks, and the clashes in the hills behind the village.\nBut the disaster acted as an immediate catalyst for peace talks, and today the province continues to benefit from an autonomy deal that ended the conflict.\nThe new government has since introduced elements of Sharia - which many here, including Marwadah, publicly support.\nBut critics say public floggings and other punishments are an abuse of human rights, and that foreign investors are increasingly steering clear of a province that is now falling behind the rest of Indonesia in terms of economic growth and poverty reduction.\n\"We like Sharia. And I am a good Muslim,\" says Marwadah, but she believes the officials who police the new laws are often \"hypocrites\".\nLate one afternoon, we stop at Marwadah's college in Banda Aceh where she's got a Thai kickboxing class with a group of other male and female students.\n\"She's a good student. She works hard, studies hard. As a girl, she has a spirit like a boy. She's strong. She doesn't give up easily,\" says her English teacher Maulizan Za.\nHe worries about inflation, but - like almost everyone else I ask here - believes that life is significantly better and safer than it was before the tsunami.\n\"My friends are my family now,\" says Mawardah, finishing the hour-long kickboxing class and getting ready to drive back home on her sister's motor scooter.\n\"I want to be a strong woman. After I graduate from this college I will next study in America, and get a job like a reporter. I feel my future will be bright,\" she concludes, then bursts into a confident, full-throated laugh.", "Williams, 33, won 2012 European gold, silver in 2010 when he also claimed Commonwealth Games bronze.\nThe London 2012 Olympian had hoped to compete in the Commonwealths on the Gold Coast in April 2018.\nWilliams was ruled out of Glasgow 2014 after failing a doping test and given a four-month ban for inadvertently taking a banned supplement.\nWilliams won Commonwealth bronze in Delhi in 2010 behind Welsh rival Dai Greene but injury put paid to his bid to win another medal in Australia next year.\n\"As a patriotic Welshman, nothing has given me more pride than putting on a Welsh vest and competing for my country,\" said Williams.\n\"Unfortunately, injury has prematurely ended my hopes of competing one last time at the Commonwealth Games next year.\n\"I would like to thank Welsh Athletics and Sport Wales for all their help and support during my athletics career.\n\"I would also like to thank all my support team who have supported me faithfully over the years; my family, coaches, sponsors and all my training partners.\"\nWilliams, son of Welsh and Lions rugby legend JJ, was European champion from every level from Under-18 to senior level where he also won silver and bronze in 2006 and 2010 to go with his 2012 triumph.\nHe competed for Wales at two Commonwealth Games, finishing fourth in Melbourne in 2006 with his bronze in Delhi coming four years later.\nWilliams competed for Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics where he reached the semi-final, the same level he also achieved at the 2005 and 2013 World Championships.\nWelsh Athletics head of coaching and performance Scott Simpson said: \"Rhys' decision to retire from the sport is one that has clearly been given a great deal of thought and one that we have met with the utmost respect and support.\n\"It is never an easy decision to make.

The swing factor between a continuing stable but uninspiring global recovery and relapse into a global downturn is China.\nThe big question is: how steep is China's economic slowdown? Those looking for an answer have pointed to China's surprise decision to devalue its currency in early August.\nDoes this suggest that policy-makers are panicking and trying to boost exports?\nThe fundamental problem that China faces is that its economy is deeply unbalanced - both internally and externally - at a time that it is also slowing.\nEconomists tend to look at an economy for internal balance (a state of affairs in which neither employment nor inflation is too high or too low) and external balance (a situation in which a country's current account (its borrowing or lending to the rest of the world) is neither too high nor too low.\nChina is currently struggling to achieve both kinds of balance.\nChinese policy-makers have a tricky task ahead but not unmanageable one.\nIt's a challenge that could be made much easier by some global policy co-ordination and co-operation.\nAt the heart of China's problem is the  \"impossible trinity\" of international macroeconomics.\nThe impossible trinity - or trilemma - is the idea that it is impossible for a country to have three things at the same time: a stable currency, the free movement of capital (i.e. the absence of capital controls) and independent monetary policy.\nA country can instead choose just two of the options from this policy suite.\nThe UK, in common with most developed economies, has free capital movement and an independent monetary policy - but not a controlled exchange rate.\nThe Bank of England sets interest rates at a level it thinks is right for the UK economy and - as capital can flow into and out of the UK at will - the exchange rate is determined by the market.\nIf, as in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the UK wanted to retain free movement of capital but have a stable exchange rate then it would cease to have an independent monetary policy.\nInstead of being set as appropriate for UK domestic conditions, the interest rate would have to be set to maintain the value of sterling against other currencies - in effect monetary policy would be outsourced.\nChina's policy mix has been to have an independent monetary policy and a controlled exchange rate, which has meant restrictions of the free movement of capital.\nIn reality the situation is a bit more complicated. China's capital controls are porous, money does flow in and out of the country and the renmimbi has been semi-pegged to the dollar, rather than straight-forwardly stable.\nBut things are changing. China is currently pushing for the renmimbi to be formally included in the International Monetary Fund's list of reserve currencies.\nPart of that process involves dismantling its capital controls bit that exposes its own central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), to the trilemma.\nThe slowing domestic economy suggests an easier monetary stance is required and that an easier monetary stance, coupled with freer movement of capital, suggests that a weaker renmimbi lies ahead.\nBut as Karthik Sankaran of Eurasia Group has convincingly argued this wouldn't be ideal either for China or for the global economy.\nDomestically, a weaker currency would tighten financial conditions for any Chinese company that has borrowed in dollars at a time when the PBOC was trying to ease them. But the international spill-overs of a weaker Chinese currency matter more.\nBefore the financial crisis of 2008 China's economy was far from externally balanced - indeed it was a major driver of global imbalance, with a current account surplus of 10% of GDP. That's now down to around 2%, but a weaker currency could force it back up.\nAt a time when disinflationary factors, such as lower commodity prices, are at work and when Western inflation is stuck around 0%, then the last thing the world needs is a Chinese devaluation which would risk turning a still benign period of low inflation into a damaging spell of deflation.\nChina needs easier monetary policy and the world could do without a much weaker renmimbi.\nThankfully that is an achievable mix. But it requires Chinese capital controls to stay in place for longer than intended - giving China the ability to both have an independent monetary policy and a stable exchange rate.\nThe IMF was once regarded as fairly dogmatic on the need for countries to sign up to the free movement of capital.\nBut during the crisis that attitude shifted and the Fund recognised that there are times when capital controls might be appropriate. China right now feels like one of those times. If China can keep its capital controls while moving towards reserve currency status - even for a while - it may be better placed to seek balance.\nIt's very easy to attack China's economic policy missteps of the past few years.\nPropping up an overvalued stock market and surprising the market with currency announcements are just the latest examples.\nBut the bigger criticism is usually over the nature of the post-2009 stimulus package - which kept Chinese growth high by going on a credit and investment binge driven by state owned enterprises, state owned banks and local government.\nThat's left the Chinese economy with a serious mal-investment problem (the often mentioned empty ghost cities) and high level of debt.\nBut, for all the criticism, the counterfactual is rarely stated. What would global growth have looked like without it?\nAt a time when the world was desperately short of economic demand, China stepped up and provided some.\nThat stimulus package helped prop up global growth during the crisis but left China's economy dangerously out of balance.\nHelping China make the transition back towards balance needs to be a central aim for global policymakers.", "Controversial plans to add a further 16 turbines at Scout Moor, on land between Rochdale and Rossendale, were approved earlier this year.\nBut now the government has \"called in\" the decision by Rossendale Borough Council to approve 14 of the turbines.\nIt means a public inquiry will be held before further progress is made.\nScout Moor wind farm opened in 2008 with the 26 existing wind turbines generating enough electricity for 40,000 homes.\nRochdale Borough Council approved plans for the final two turbines to be added.\nOpponents are concerned the expansion of the wind farm will impact negatively on the natural beauty of the area.\nBut energy companies Peel Energy and United Utilities said consultations have shown opposition to the plans is low.\nMW = Megawatts\nSource: RenewableUK", "Together with Charlie Adam's 65-yard strike, Bobby Zamora's lob, Wayne Rooney's volley, Bafetimbi Gomis's acrobatic effort and Alexis Sanchez's thunderbolt, we could almost put together a list of goal of the season contenders in one week.\nBBC Sport takes a look at the goals that were scored, asks which was the best and reports the reaction they all brought.

she was reported missing by her husband.\nShe was found by police in Northern Ireland eight years later after another woman, Mandy Highfield, contacted officers.\nMs Highfield had also lived with Keith Baker and was the mother of four of his children.\nWhen detectives searched the house they found videos of the Bakers abusing their victim.\nThe images showed how she had deteriorated from being relatively healthy to malnourished over the years she was held inside the house.\nSpeaking after the sentencing, the head of the Police Service of Northern Ireland's public protection unit said the Bakers had carried out \"an appalling litany of crimes\".\nThe abuse to which they subjected the woman was \"filmed for their own sexual gratification\", said Det Ch Supt George Clarke, adding that they had stolen her basic human rights.\nThe case had been a \"difficult, challenging and emotional\" one for the police officers involved, he added, but that \"pales to insignificance\" to what the woman was forced to endure.\n\"What [she] went through is unimaginable - it doesn't bear thinking about what this victim endured over the thousands of days she was kept prisoner,\" said Mr Clarke.", "The 3,000-year-old artefact was found at a site dubbed \"Britain's Pompeii\", at Must Farm in Cambridgeshire.\nArchaeologists have described the find - made close to the country's \"best-preserved Bronze Age dwellings\" - as \"unprecedented\".\nStill containing its hub, the 3ft-diameter (one metre) wooden wheel dates from about 1,100 to 800 BC.\nThe wheel was found close to the largest of one of the roundhouses found at the settlement last month.\nLive: More on the Bronze Age wheel discovery\nIts discovery \"demonstrates the inhabitants of this watery landscape's links to the dry land beyond the river\", David Gibson from Cambridge Archaeological Unit, which is leading the excavation, said.\nHistoric England, which is jointly funding the \u00c2\u00a31.1m excavation with landowner Forterra, described the find as \"unprecedented in terms of size and completeness\".\n\"This remarkable but fragile wooden wheel is the earliest complete example ever found in Britain,\" chief executive Duncan Wilson said.\n\"The existence of this wheel expands our understanding of Late Bronze Age technology, and the level of sophistication of the lives of people living on the edge of the Fens 3,000 years ago.\"\nThe dig site, at Must Farm quarry near Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire has been described as \"unique\" by Mr Gibson.\nIt has proved to be a treasure trove for archaeologists who earlier this year uncovered two or possibly three roundhouses dating from about 1,000-800 BC.\nThe timbers had been preserved in silt after falling into a river during a fire.\nKasia Gdaniec, senior archaeologist at the county council, said the \"fabulous artefacts\" found at the site continued to \"amaze and astonish\".\n\"This wheel poses a challenge to our understanding of both Late Bronze Age technological skill and - together with the eight boats recovered from the same river in 2011 - transportation,\" she said.\nThe spine of what is thought to be a horse, found in early January, could suggest the wheel belonged to a horse-drawn cart, however, it is too early to know how the wheel was used, archaeologist Chris Wakefield said.\nWhile the Must Farm wheel is the most complete, it is not the oldest to be discovered in the area.\nAn excavation at a Bronze Age site at Flag Fen near Peterborough uncovered a smaller, partial wheel dating to about 1,300 BC.\nThe wheel was thought to have been part of a cart that could have carried up to two people.\nThe Must Farm quarry site has given up a number of its hidden treasures over the years including a dagger found in 1969 and bowls still containing remnants of food, found in 2006.\nMore recently the roundhouses, built on stilts, were discovered.\nA fire destroyed the posts, causing the houses to fall into a river where silt helped preserve the timbers and contents.\n\"We're here in the middle of the Fens, a very wet environment, so the biggest question we've got to answer at the moment is 'Why on earth is there a wheel in the middle of this really wet river channel?',\" says archaeologist Chris Wakefield.\n\"The houses are built over a river and within those deposits is sitting a wheel - which is pretty much the archetype of what you'd expect to have on dry land - so it's very, very unusual.\"\nAn articulated animal spine found nearby - at first thought to be from a cow - is now believed to be that of a horse.\n\"[This] has pretty strong ties if they were using something like a cart.\n\"In the Bronze Age horses are quite uncommon. It's not until the later period of the Middle Iron Age that they become more widespread, so aside from this very exciting discovery of the wheel, we've also got potentially other related aspects that are giving us even more questions.\n\"This site is giving us lots of answers but at the same time it's throwing up questions we never thought we'd have to consider.\"\nAnalysing the data from samples found at Must Farm could take the team several years, he added.\nOther artefacts found inside the roundhouses themselves - including a small wooden box, platter, an intact \"fineware\" pot and clusters of animal and fish bones that could have been kitchen waste - have been described as \"amazing\" by archaeologists.\nThe team is just over halfway through the eight-month dig to uncover the secrets of the site and the people who lived there.", "The US president-elect was being sued by former students who paid $35,000 (\u00c2\u00a328,000) for real estate \"secrets\" from his \"hand-picked\" instructors.\nMr Trump had repeatedly said he would not settle the class-action lawsuits.\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman said the settlement was a \"stunning reversal\" by Mr Trump and a \"major victory\" for victims.\nBut Mr Trump's lawyer Daniel Petrocelli said his client was pleased with the outcome, saying \"he was willing to sacrifice his personal interests, put this behind him, and move forward\".\nThe businessman faced three fraud lawsuits - which alleged the school misled students and failed to deliver on its promises - in California and New York.\nA trial in one of the cases had been due to begin in San Diego on 28 November, although Mr Trump's lawyers had attempted to delay the case.\nDonald Trump's ongoing lawsuits\nAttorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement: \"Today's $25 million settlement agreement is a stunning reversal by Donald Trump and a major victory for the over 6,000 victims of his fraudulent university.\n\"The victims of Trump University have waited years for today's result and I am pleased that their patience - and persistence - will be rewarded by this $25 million settlement.\"\nMr Schneiderman, who Mr Trump has attacked as a \"lightweight\", had sought a $40m payout from Mr Trump over the university, which closed in 2010.\nHe called Trump University a \"fraud from beginning to end\" in July, adding that the organisation used \"false promises to prey on desperate people\".\nUS District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who is presiding over the two California cases, had been urging both sides to settle out of court.\nThe settlement may be costly but it will save the President-elect from a potentially embarrassing trial.\nDonald Trump had vowed to keep fighting this case and his attorneys said they had no doubt he would have won in court, but they added that a resolution allows Mr Trump to devote his full attention to the important issues facing the nation.\nSettling though could backfire on Mr Trump as he is facing dozens of lawsuits.\nPlaintiffs may smell blood and think he is eager to settle to avoid court cases while president.\nIn June, Mr Trump said: \"I will win the Trump University case. I already am, as far as I'm concerned.\n\"I could settle that case. I could have settled that case. I just choose not to.\"\nTrump University promised students the opportunity to learn from \"hand-picked\" teachers, that actually were not chosen by Mr Trump himself.\nMr Schneiderman alleged that the closest students ever got to the real estate mogul was having their photo taken beside a cardboard cutout of him. He also said that Mr Trump personally pocketed about $5m (\u00c2\u00a34m) in the \"scheme\".\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump has named more conservative hardliners for key posts, with Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions nominated as attorney general, the country's top law enforcement office.\nMr Sessions was rejected from becoming a federal judge in 1986 because of alleged racist remarks.\nIn a statement, Mr Trump called Mr Sessions a \"world class legal mind\".\nThe people around President-elect Trump\nJeff Sessions dogged by racism claims\nMike Pompeo - America's likely new spymaster\nTrump takes office: Full report\nMike Pompeo will be CIA director and retired Lt Gen Michael Flynn has been made national security adviser.

However a second 999 call, made several minutes later, reported that he had kicked it.\nThe teenager's mother told the Ombudsman that the police investigation had been closed down after two week, despite her being told that her son had denied kicking the window and had a memory of being pushed.\nShe also alleged that police had failed to ensure her son's phone was properly examined, and that officers may have missed evidence.\nWhen interviewed, the investigating police officer accepted that the case had been quickly suspended pending new evidence. However, he said he had done so only after making a series, after which he was satisfied no further investigation was needed.\nThe officer also told the Ombudsman's investigation that the only indication the teenager had been pushed was the initial 999 call. He added that the friend who made the call had explained that the injured boy did not want to get into trouble for kicking the window and had asked him to say he was pushed.\nHowever the Police Ombudsman's investigation found a number of issues with how the officer dealt with the case.\nIt said there was a \"limited examination of text messages\" exchanged between the boys who had been at the scene.\nThe investigation also found that photographs of the scene were lost and that there was no forensic examination of the window to establish whether the damage caused was consistent with the boy having been pushed through it,.\nThe officer's supervisor was also found to have not properly supervised the investigation.\nThe Ombudsman found no evidence that the police investigation had been compromised as a result of links between police officers and the families of two of the boys who had been at the scene.\nThe PSNI has since implemented the Ombudsman's recommendation that the investigating officer and his supervisor should both be disciplined for their handling of the case.", "It is one of a number of options being considered by the Weston Area Health NHS Trust, as it tries to comply with new government health reforms.\nThe complex is \u00c2\u00a35m in debt and must cut losses ahead of new government rules.\nA statement from Weston Area Health NHS Trust said discussions about its future were \"progressing well\", and stressed NHS services will continue in the town.\nNew government rules say all NHS trusts must become foundation trusts by April 2014, thereby proving they can run their services without going into debt and function independently of the Department of Health.\nAs well possibly entering into a partnership with an external organisation, merging with a foundation trust is another option.\n\"We announced in November that as the trust was one of the smallest in the country, it did not have the critical mass of services sufficient to become a standalone NHS Foundation Trust,\" the trust statement continued.\nBy Nigel DandoChief reporter, BBC Radio Bristol\nIt's a big problem in the case of the hospital trust here in Weston.\nThere are two options which the trust is now considering - they can be acquired by another NHS Foundation Trust or they can find a partner to run the hospital's services.\nThat partner could be from the private sector. It could be a voluntary organisation or it could be a charity.\nMy understanding is that the trust  has been looking at the private sector model, although nothing has yet been decided.\nThe high-profile example of this approach is at Hinchingbrooke Hospital in Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire. Last February it became the first NHS hospital to be operated by a private partner, when the Circle Partnership took over its running.\n\"Whichever route we end up taking, it is clear that the trust must, and will, continue to provide NHS services for NHS patients. Whatever option is  selected, all staff and assets will remain within the NHS.\"\nThe financial deficit at Weston General Hospital has, until now, been covered by the NHS North Somerset Primary Care Trust (PCT).\nThat arrangement will end shortly when the PCT is disbanded and replaced by what is called a clinical commissioning group, which will not have the money to bail out the hospital.\nWeston Area Health NHS Trust was one of three trusts in England highlighted recently by the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee as not having a proper financial plan for its future.\nChristina Cook from the Unison trade union said: \"Unison is totally opposed to the privatisation of Weston General Hospital as its members wish to continue working for the NHS.\n\"Unison members feel very strongly about this subject and are prepared to campaign against privatisation.\"", "The 27-year-old's body was found after officers were called to his Isle of Man home on 30 July.\nInsp Iain MacMillan said: \"Mr

was made by Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry during a news briefing in Washington on Monday.\nIt comes before Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is to meet Barack Obama in Washington on Thursday.\nThe two are expected to discuss Pakistan's nuclear programme among other issues, including Afghanistan and militant groups such as the Haqqani network and Lashkar-e-Taiba.\nMr Chaudhry's disclosure is seen by many as the first concrete explanation by a Pakistani official of how Pakistan intends to deal with possible Indian aggression.\n\"The fact that Pakistan was making small tactical nuclear weapons was clear to the world from the day Pakistan started its missile programme,\" says Pervez Hoodbhoy, a nuclear physicist and independent security analyst based in Lahore.\n\"It meant that Pakistan had developed low-yield nuclear warheads to be delivered by those missiles at short ranges, in a battlefield, having localised impact, unlike big bombs designed to destroy cities.\"\nExperts believe that the 2011 testing of the nuclear-capable Nasr missile with a 60km range was an indication that Pakistan was building an arsenal of tactical nuclear weapons for use in a theatre of war.\nHasan Askari Rizvi, a Lahore-based expert on defence and security issues, suspects Pakistan may have designed even smaller nuclear weapons, capable of being shot from a specially-designed gun.\n\"The Americans apparently know about these weapons, and recent debate in the US media suggests that Pakistan may actually be in possession of tactical weapons which are greater in number and accuracy than those of India,\" he says.\nMr Hoodbhoy points out that these battlefield weapons could be more dangerous than larger weapons because in the event of a conflict, they will need to be spread out, deployed at multiple locations closer to the targets, and would need to be fired at short notice.\n\"Compliance with nuclear command and control procedures may not always be adequately ensured for all the missile units deployed across a theatre,\" he says.\nAnother matter of concern for Western powers is the fact that Pakistan developed these weapons despite nuclear-related international sanctions in force since 1998, when it carried out its first nuclear test.\nThere is a belief that much of this technology has been acquired from China, a pipeline which will be difficult to block unless Pakistan is brought into the nuclear mainstream.\nThere have been suggestions the US may offer Pakistan membership of the Nuclear Suppliers' Group, with legitimate access to available research and technology, in return for some curbs on fissile material production and its missiles programme.\nIn Pakistan, where the civilian leadership has seemingly been under pressure from the military in matters related to defence and foreign affairs, these suggestions are being touted as a warning that the Americans might try to force Mr Sharif, a civilian, to agree to nuclear curbs.\nMr Chaudhry's statement came against this backdrop, and since he has made no significant disclosures, Prof Askari thinks there may be two reasons why he chose to talk about the issue at all.\n\"One is apparently to reassure domestic audience that there's going to be no 'sell-out' on the nuclear issue,\" he says.\n\"The second may well be to officially confirm to India what it might expect if it ever decides on surgical action or hot pursuit inside Pakistan.\"\nPakistan banned a film released in August called Phantom. It was based on a covert Indian operation to kill the 2008 Mumbai attack plotters, including Hafiz Saeed, the former head of militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is accused of carrying out the attack.\n\"The Americans killed Osama by barging in, why can't we do the same?\" says the agent in charge of the mission, played by Muslim actor Saif Ali Khan.\nIndia said that any nuclear attack on its forces would be treated as a nuclear strike on India itself and it would respond accordingly - so observers warn any use of nuclear weapons could quickly escalate.", "Five men and a woman from Devon each faced charges under the Animal Welfare Act at Newton Abbot Magistrates Court.\nAfter legal argument the charges were dismissed by a district judge as not being animal fighting as defined by the act, said the RSPCA.\nThe charity said it was \"considering its position\" after the decision on 12 November.\nThe RSPCA said in a statement that the judge ruled that \"'taking a dog into the countryside seeking another animal to attack and perhaps kill, in that other animal's own environment and in which that animal is not constrained, artificially or otherwise' did not constitute animal fighting as defined in the act.\n\"The Animal Welfare Act has been one of the most successful ever pieces of legislation in protecting animals from harm and the RSPCA furthers its charitable purposes through enforcing the legislation.\"\nDefence lawyer Simon Rees said on Facebook that the judge was \"100% correct in his interpretation of the law\".\nHe said: \"The decision was that section 8 of the Animal Welfare Act was confined to animal fighting proper and was not, as the RSPCA suggested, any fight between say a lurcher and a fox in the context of a hunt.\n\"The decision upheld the old law under the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which the Animal Welfare Act replaced, to the effect that only captive animals could be the subject of fighting.\"", "People in Merseyside are paying the most in England for their electricity and Londoners the most for gas, the new figures suggest.\nAverage annual household bills in Merseyside are \u00a31,346 for electricity and gas.\nThat compared with \u00a31,261 in the East of England.\nA DECC spokeswoman said areas such as Merseyside were paying more because of the costs of distribution and transmission from one region to another.\nLondon paid the most in the UK for gas, at \u00a3743 per household per year.

and the people of Ebbw Vale will want to know what will happen to these promises if the numbers don't stack up.\"\nA Welsh Government spokeswoman said: \"As the Conservatives already know, extensive external and internal due diligence around the Circuit of Wales project made clear that the main benefits to the local economy would come from businesses clustering in Blaenau Gwent, rather than directly from the race track.\"\nWhile the Conservatives had been \"talking the plans down\", Mr Skates had been meeting businesses, academics and local politicians to make the plan a success, she added.\n\"There is strong and collective ambition between Welsh Government and its partners to shape and deliver a project that can genuinely regenerate the local economy and create the high quality jobs the area needs,\" she said.\n\"We will publish a business case later in the year that draws upon specialist advice and reflects the views emerging from our partners.\"", "But not Gillian and Craig Kelly - they were given an hour-and-a-half's notice before saying \"I do\".\nThe couple used to joke that horticulturist Gillian would probably be in her wellies and rocker Craig in his leathers when they finally got around to it, and that is exactly what happened.\nThey imagined their wedding taking place on the beach at Castlerock but they ended up tying the knot in the Northern Ireland Hospice, at Gillian's mum's bedside.\nGillian's Disney-mad, poetry-writing mum Margaret Simpson has cancer of the liver, bowel and colon, and she has been living in the hospice since May.\nThe 57-year-old started to deteriorate last week and on Thursday, hospice staff asked the family if they had any more memories left to make.\nWhen Margaret was first diagnosed, she said she would like to see her eldest daughter get married and so Gillian knew that simply had to happen.\nThey started planning the wedding for a week's time at the hospice on Belfast's Somerton Road, heading immediately to the City Hall for emergency marriage licences.\n\"We decided to get married at two o'clock last Thursday, and we were ordering cakes by 3.30,\" she said.\n\"On the way home from the hospice, I stopped to get craft supplies and invites were posted on Friday morning\".\nHowever, staff became concerned that Margaret was getting too excited - she was inviting all the doctors and nurses, and insisted on getting out of bed to make as many paper flowers as she could during art therapy.\nThey wanted Gillian, 33, and Craig, 27, to \"stagger the celebrations\" and last Friday afternoon, the couple were told the chaplain had limited availability.\n\"I phoned Craig and told him to get down to the hospice as we were getting married in an hour. I needed a shower and was still in my gardening wellies but I just borrowed some deodorant and moisturiser from mum.\n\"It was a lovely service. Then my dad went out and got donuts and Buck's Fizz\".\nHowever, there was not much time for celebrating, as the couple had to get \"married again\" in six days' time on Thursday 6 July.\nThe venue was the same but this time, they had the whole \"kit and caboodle\" - 40 guests, three cakes, two chocolate fountains, a DJ, orders of service and favours.\nThey had two flowergirls - Craig's six-year-old daughter Sammie and Pip, the family's rescue Jack Russell, who looked the part in a grey bow.\nIn addition to the hospice - they provided the venue, the catering and the music therapist played the flute as they walked in - Gillian said her friends and families rallied to the cause, decorating the room, offering their services up as hairdresser, make-up artist and photographer.\n\"The hospice staff were out of this world,\" she said.\n\"What they did for my mum was above and beyond. The nurses who looked after her all day weren't even meant to be in work. How am I meant to thank them? A box of chocolates and a card are not going to do it.\n\"My mum was glowing. There wasn't a dry eye but they were happy tears.\n\"It was just magical. It could not have been any better had we spent months planning it.\"\nGillian, a horticulturist, said the most important thing was having all her family there.\n\"We are a small wee family - my mum, dad, sister and me - and we've had a terrible year.\"\nShe said they were generally a \"well family\" but within nine months, her dad's diabetes had worsened, her sister had been diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS and she is now waiting on a pacemaker after being diagnosed with heart failure.\nThen her mum started to feel unwell in September.\n\"Our world stopped when we heard she had terminal cancer. Our illnesses were manageable, liveable. No-one gets out alive but mum is only 57.\"\nThey were nervous about their mum going into the hospice, which provides care to more than 3,500 children and adults with life-limiting or terminal conditions every year. but Gillian says it has \"given her a life\".\n\"It's not a place to die, it's a place to live,\" she said. \"It's not a death sentence. It's a place of dignity, respect and comfort.\n\"It sounds so ridiculous and obviously no-one wants to be there but the fact she is there is a godsend.\"", "The charity said 111 people were killed and more than 1,000 seriously injured on Welsh roads last year.\nIt is launching its \"look out for each other\" campaign at the start of Road Safety Week.\nIt said: \"Road crashes are not accidents; they are devastating and preventable events.\"", "But within hours of his arrival the celebrations were overshadowed for new parents Ben and Kate Ryan.\nIt was the news anyone would dread. Something was wrong. Sol needed emergency surgery.\nHe was whisked away from the north Wales maternity ward to Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital.\n\"I remember just thinking 'I must be dreaming - this is a nightmare',\" recalled Sol's father.\n\"The consultant in Alder Hey was telling me that almost certainly Sol was going to have to lose his left hand.\"\nAt just 10 days old, surgeons made the devastating decision to amputate Sol's left arm just below the elbow because of a blood clot.\n\"It was a very, very black period of time. I couldn't quite believe what was happening,\" said Ben.\n\"I just went into emergency mode - I think everyone does. You just deal with it because you have to.\"\nWeeks later, back at the family home in Menai Bridge on Anglesey, Ben was left reflecting on the words of the nurse telling them that Sol's blood group was B-Positive.\n\"I just took that as a sign - to be positive,\" said Ben.\n\"Stop thinking about what he can't do - what can we do? From that point on I just said that I'm not going to dwell on the negatives, I'm only going to be positive. I'm only going to think about what we can do.\"\nAnd what could Ben do for his son?\nAs a further education psychology lecturer by profession, Sol's father was absolutely convinced that early intervention was vital for his son to adapt to life without his arm and hand.\nBut he soon learnt health professionals would not offer help with prosthetic false arms until Sol was a year old - and even then, the artificial arms would be purely cosmetic with no grabbing or holding action.\nSol's dad did not want to wait a year.\n\"I just thought that wasn't good enough,\" stated Ben.\nFirst, he used rolled-up pieces of foam taped to Sol's elbow to see what would happen.\nWithin minutes, Sol was banging his toys with his hand - and his foam arm. It was the first time he had tried to use the left arm since the amputation.\n\"Before that, the left arm didn't do anything.\"\nIt was the breakthrough moment for Ben. From there, developing a better prosthetic arm for young Sol became an obsession.\nWorking on the kitchen table with bits of copper pipe and plumbing fittings, Ben came up with an idea for a new design that would operate a hand using tiny movements of the elbow.\nConvinced it would work, he walked into a newly opened innovation laboratory at Bangor University and asked them for help.\n\"When I started to talk to Ben and found out what he wanted to do and why he wanted to come here, I was quite humbled really,\" remembered Wyn Griffith, chief technician for Pontio Innovation.\n\"We'd just moved into this building - what better way to put this new equipment to use than to actually help Ben with his project.\"\nUsing state-of-the-art 3D printing technology at the innovation lab, Ben and the university staff were able to turn a mish-mash of DIY store parts and imagination into something much more.\n\"The best way we can help people, is to help them help themselves - and I think Ben is a good case in point there. We've given Ben the skills and access to the equipment and training so he can actually develop his own ideas,\" said the university engineer.\nToday, Sol has a new prototype of an arm and hand that can grip, with a moveable thumb.\nAnd instead of the three months it takes to cast and build a fibreglass prosthetic through the health service, a new arm can be built and printed from scratch in a matter of days.\nIt means not only is the young boy getting the early intervention his family are convinced he needs, it has opened up a whole new world of opportunities for his father.\nBen has given up his day job to concentrate full-time on prosthetics, setting up a new company called Ambionics, with Sol firmly the poster boy for the new venture.\nDespite being a fledgling start-up, Ben has already won some big name backing. Along with Bangor University's Pontio centre, Ambionics is also being supported by the Life Sciences Hub Wales and its entrepreneurship programme.\nHe has also won praise from the firm Stratasys, who developed the 3D printers he has been using.\n\"Ben Ryan's approach to problem solving with 3D printing as a facilitator and the terrific results enjoyed by doing so are indicative of what can be achieved when harnessing this technology,\" said the firm's head of healthcare solutions, Scott Rader.\nSo far, the whole project has been funded by family and friends, but will be the focus of a crowd funding campaign on St David's Day on Wednesday, 1 March.\nBen wants to raise at least \u00c2\u00a3150,000 to satisfy medical authorities his arm prosthetics are safe to use, finalise patents, and to develop the design.\nIf he can raise even more, he wants to see medical research trials to back up his own theories on how young children learn to use artificial limbs.\nBut as the business moves forward, the focus always returns to Sol - the Ambionic Boy as his dad now calls him.\n\"He can do 90% of the things a kid with two hands can do, I just want to help him adjust to those 10% of tasks he is going to find difficult,\" said Ben.\n\"The point I will relax is when I see him reach for something. I want him to turn around and just be able to pick something up just naturally, and then I'll know that I've done a good job.\"", "All birds at the farm in Goosnargh, Preston, are due to be culled and animal movements have been restricted within a 10km \"control zone\".\nDefra said the decision to cull was \"based on the clinical symptoms and emerging laboratory findings\".\nThe risk to public health was very low, a spokesman added.\n\"We have a strong track record of controlling and eliminating previous outbreaks of avian flu in the UK,\" he said.\n\"The outbreaks in Yorkshire last year and Hampshire in February were both successfully contained, allowing restrictions to be lifted at the earliest opportunity.\"\nDefra's chief vet Nigel Gibbens added: \"We have taken swift precautionary action to limit the risk of the disease spreading.

Phil Neville joins Danny Murphy and Gary Lineker in the studio.\nThey are on a bad run, obviously, but I don't think it is Pardew's fault. I actually feel sorry for him, because Palace's players are letting him down big-time at the moment.\nSometimes you can see a manager has picked the wrong team, is using the wrong tactics or has signed the wrong players.\nBut those are not the reasons why Crystal Palace lost at Swansea, or why they are struggling right now.\nThey are in this situation because their players' application when they are defending set-pieces is nothing short of a disgrace.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFour of the five goals that Swansea scored on Saturday were from set-pieces, and Palace have now conceded 13 goals from free-kicks or corners in 13 Premier League games this season - five more than any other team.\nYou might see those statistics as being down to the manager but, against Swansea, Pardew set his players up in the perfect position to defend them, and they let him down.\nIt keeps happening, and it keeps costing Palace points - look at last week's game against Manchester City when they switched off and Yaya Toure scored a late winner for City from a corner.\nYou cannot blame Pardew for that. As a manager, you cannot defend them yourself - successfully stopping teams at set-pieces is down to the players.\nFor me, it is about having the courage to win the ball and put your head in, sometimes where it hurts, and if your job is to pick someone up then you have to be focused on doing it.\nLike I say, a manager can affect none of those things during a game. All Pardew can do with Palace is set them up in the right positions. He is doing that, but he cannot make them defend.\nAt the moment I think Palace's players lack courage, determination and concentration at set-pieces, and they are paying the price for it.\nLast season under Pardew, Palace had the joint-best record at defending set-pieces in the top-flight.\nAlong with Tottenham they conceded only seven times from them in 38 games, and they are not something his sides are previously known to struggle with.\nThey obviously practice defending free-kicks and corners in training and they will also have had some of Swansea's set-pieces up on their wall of the dressing room.\nSo I am sure they were as well-prepared as possible ahead of Saturday's game, but they kept on conceding goals that way.\nIf you are playing Palace and you get a free-kick in their half, you will now be thinking that there is a 60-70% chance we are going to score.\nUnlike some of the other teams at the wrong end of the table, scoring goals is not a problem for Pardew's side - they have got players who can score and the system they play, using the flanks and putting in lots of crosses, gets the best out of them.\nThey don't lack quality, or spirit either. They are not what I would call a 'dead' team - in fact they are very dangerous when they attack.\nIt is purely and simply defensive set-pieces where they have problems. That is why they have fallen to near the bottom of the league.\nI don't think Palace's latest defeat will cost Pardew his job.\nPardew is lucky because he is at a pretty unique club where the chairman Steve Parish is sensible - he understands football, can see what is happening and knows he has got a good manager.\nIt is rare these days to see a calm chairman, not somebody who will lose his head and think it is sacking season.\nBut Pardew is obviously highly thought of at Palace and is at a club where he will get time.\nThat situation will not last forever if his side keep losing, though, and the next two games are crucial for Pardew because Palace have got some very tough fixtures after that.\nHis team have to start winning soon but they are definitely capable of turning this bad run around. I think they are too good to be where they are in the table.\nPardew must stay positive too. He was clearly very disappointed straight after the Swansea game but sometimes as a manager you cannot do anything about a defeat.\nHe just has to accept what went wrong, keep working hard and hope that, when it comes to stopping set-pieces, the penny will eventually drop for his players.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPhil Neville was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "They say it is inappropriate the show is taking place as part of F\u00e9ile an Phobail because of controversial jokes Mr Boyle has made in the past about disabled people.\nLast month, festival organisers said they were \"deeply sorry for any hurt or offence\" that had been caused by Mr Boyle's appearance.\nThey said they would put in place measures to avoid such a situation \"arising in the future\".\nOpponents had demanded the show's cancellation because of jokes Boyle has told about people with Down's syndrome.\nMr Boyle made his remarks during a live show in 2010.\nThe mother of a girl with the condition said he had \"made fun of the way people with Down's syndrome speak\" and \"made a number of references to people with Down's syndrome dying early\".\nFestival organisers met those who were opposed to the comedian's performance but said the gig would go-ahead.\nF\u00e9ile management also gave a pledge to represent the concerns of the group to Boyle's management.\nF\u00e9ile an Phobail said the show had been the fastest-selling comedy gig it has ever put on.\nLocal comedian Shane Todd has a sister who has autism and spina bifida.\n\"I think he's a very, very good comedian,\" he said.\n\"He certainly does talk about a lot of taboo subjects, granted, but I think he's a very intelligent guy and often he puts quite a different slant on things.\n\"They're not as bad as they sound when they're written down in black and white, but I can understand being a community festival why some people are offended by it and don't want it to go ahead, but in terms of his brand of humour, I'm a fan of Frankie Boyle.\"\nMr Todd said nothing was off limits as a comedian if you could come at it from an intelligent angle and put a different slant on it and not just poke fun.\n\"Are some of his jokes offensive?

[Don't worry, BBC graphics designers, I'm not seriously thinking of doing this. Not yet at least!]\nBut the important point here is that the composition of the different magnets and their respective strengths would be very different from one constituency to another.\nIn this era of multi-party politics, every single seat is more or less a law unto itself.\nTake for example two of our key local marginals, Dudley North and Solihull.\nIn the Black Country seat, Labour are defending a majority of just 649.\nIn 2010 their closest challengers were the Conservatives. This time, though, with nine seats on the local council its is UKIP who are breathing down Labour's neck.\nSolihull is another key Conservative target. The Liberal Democrats had a majority over them of just 175 last time round. But since then, the Green Party has established itself as a real force in the town, thanks to a potent combination of green belt and housing issues.\nExtreme examples though they may be, these two constituencies reinforce the point that whether or not UKIP or the Greens succeed in winning seats themselves, or even come close to doing so, they will undoubtedly have significant and differing impacts on the established parties from one seat to another.\nLike a collection of by-elections perhaps?\nThat may be overstating it. But I am becoming increasingly convinced that this election offers us regional and local broadcasters a unique opportunity to explore the local dynamics of individual seats and to explain the possibility that in the shake-out of seats between the biggest parties it is not unreasonable to envisage gains and losses in both directions.\nAnd what does this tell us about those headline national poll ratings pointing to a hung Parliament, in which the two biggest parties in lock step with each other followed by UKIP, the Liberal Democrats and then the Greens?\nOr, about those \"percentage swing to win or lose\" statistics which have been calculated in a predominantly two-party environment?\nAll it tells us is how little they tell us.\n\"Never assume\" said the recently-departed doyen of cricket commentators Richie Benaud.\nIn an election as unpredictable as this, maybe the assumptions about a hung Parliament are themselves suspect. Maybe the answer lies not in the macro but in the micro.\nIn this contest so full of unexpected twists and turns, how surprising would it really be if the result itself were to spring the biggest surprise of all?", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nA goal from police officer Lee Casciaro in Tuesday's Champions League qualifier condemned Celtic to arguably their worst ever defeat.\nThe Imps also included a fireman, a customs officer and a taxi driver.\n\"I'm not really [shocked].

That is unacceptable\".\nShe went on to say that she would \"consider my options and what I should do\" if a formal Scottish Parliament request to hold a referendum is turned down.\nMs Sturgeon added: \"I am determined that I will have one on my timescale, because the will of the Scottish Parliament will be respected.\n\"I accept that the prime minister has said what she has said today.

Both sides blame each other for the collapse.\nThe UN's Emergency Relief Co-ordinator, Stephen O'Brien, recently said medical facilities in east Aleppo were being destroyed \"one-by-one\".\nPatients are being turned away, no medicines are available to treat even the most common ailments, and the number of people requiring urgent medical evacuations is likely to rise dramatically with clean water and food in very short supply.\nThe Syrian American Medical Society said the area's largest hospital had been forced to close in the early days of October following a barrel bomb attack.\nThe group blamed Russian and Syrian forces for three separate attacks on the hospital within a week. Several staff were reported dead.\n\"The hospital is now not usable at all,\" said Adham Sahloul from the group, which supports the M10 hospital.\n\"It is not salvageable,\" he told the AFP news agency.\nEarlier on Friday, Russia's parliament voted to approve an \"indefinite\" deployment of forces in Syria at the Hmeimim airbase.\nThe facility had been supporting Russian troops since August 2015 on a temporary basis, but Friday's vote could lead to a permanent base.\nRussia has also been openly criticised by German leader Angela Merkel, who said it should use its influence in Syria to \"end these heinous crimes\".\nMr Kerry's remarks come hours after Russia said it was ready to back a new UN plan to end violence in Aleppo.\nStaffan de Mistura, the UN's special envoy for the Syrian crisis, appealed for fighters from the rebel group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham - formerly known as the Nusra Front - to be able to leave Aleppo with their weapons.\nEastern Aleppo, held by rebel forces, has been subjected to a constant campaign of air strikes by Syrian and Russian forces in recent weeks. About 275,000 people still live in the eastern part of the city.\nHe said he was prepared to personally accompany the jihadists out of the city if it would stop the fighting.\nRussia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, backed the plan \"for the sake of saving Aleppo.\"\nThe jihadist faction, however, has already rejected the proposal as a \"surrender\".\nRussia and Syria say their forces are attacking Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Western powers dispute this, pointing to the high proportion of civilians being killed.\nMr de Mistura said only about 900 of the estimated 8,000 fighters in eastern Aleppo were members of Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.", "President Francois Hollande's ruling Socialists lost ground overall, as turnout slumped to a record low of 61%.\nThe FN won a clear majority in Henin-Beaumont, a northern former coal-mining town.

It will mean the three parties fielding combined electoral lists.\nThe FN, an anti-EU party demanding tough curbs on immigration, took the lead in Avignon, Perpignan, Beziers and Frejus in the south. It was also in second place in Marseille.\nResults are still being counted and the second round of voting will take place next weekend.\nNationwide the opposition centre-right UMP and allies took 47%, the Socialist Party and its allies took 38% and the FN was on 5%.\nBy Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris\nThe FN's successes in the municipal election are more proof of its entrenchment in French politics.\nCertainly its score needs to be kept in perspective.  After next Sunday's second round the FN will probably only control a handful of towns.\nBut still.  Once again the party has shaken the establishment with its capacity to represent discontent.\nThe FN will take part in more than 100 \"triangular\" votes next Sunday.  These are in towns where three parties (normally the Socialists, the UMP and the FN) qualified from round one.\nPerversely these situations benefit the Socialists, because the right-wing vote is split.  Some towns may thus be saved for the left.\nIn Paris two women are in contest to be the new mayor. The rightwinger Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet has a narrow lead over the Socialist Anne Hidalgo,  but victory is far from assured.  This is because of the peculiar system in Paris,  where the mayor is chosen not directly by voters,  but by an electoral caucus of councillors from the 20 districts.\nThere was some consolation for the Socialists in Paris, where their candidate for mayor, Anne Hidalgo, may still beat her conservative rival Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet. That contest looks set to be very tight.\nThe FN vote was proportionately high, as its candidates ran in just 600 out of some 36,000 constituencies, Reuters news agency reports.\nThe BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the FN will have little chance of gaining control of town halls in the second round. But he says it is a big advance for them and an expression of growing exasperation with the traditional parties of right and left.\nThe FN is widely expected to do well in the European Parliament elections in late May - and opinion polls suggest the Eurosceptic party is on course to come top.\nIt was the first major electoral test for President Hollande, who is deeply unpopular after nearly two years in power.\nThe ballot is to choose councillors and mayors in more than 36,000 villages, towns and cities.\nThe FN took 50.26% of the vote in Henin-Beaumont, which has historically voted for the left.\nIn some 200 places FN candidates have won through to the second round.\nMarine Le Pen, FN leader since 2011, hailed the results, saying her party had \"arrived as a major independent force - a political force at both national and local level\".\nMany people who voted for President Hollande two years ago chose to abstain, which has meant losses for the Socialists, our correspondent notes, and in many important towns they will struggle in the second round to hold off challenges from the UMP.", "Amidst the outpouring of grief, one image was repeated again and again: little girls, their hair in two perfect \"cinnamon buns\", smiling for the camera.\nFisher was, of course, much more than the role she won aged 19, yet Princess Leia - and an iconic hairstyle - have come to symbolise the actress, author and script doctor.\nFisher took it in her stride, telling Time Out in 2014: \"I am Leia and Leia is me. We've overlapped each other because my life has been so cartoony or superhero-like. By this age, it would be ridiculous if I had a problem with it.\"\nBut what is it about that particular hairstyle - which only appeared in the first film - which has sparked so many imaginations over the years? And where did it come from?\nAccording to Brandon Alinger, the author of Star Wars Costumes: The Original Trilogy, the buns do not even appear in any of the concept artwork done for Leia in the preparation of the film.\nIn later interviews, Star Wars creator George Lucas said he looked to Mexico's female revolutionaries, or \"soldaderas\", who joined the uprising at the start of the 20th Century.\n\"I went with a kind of south-western Pancho Villa woman revolutionary look, which is what that is. The buns are basically from turn-of-the-century Mexico,\" Lucas told Time in 2002.\nIt makes sense to look to such a band of women when creating a character far removed from a traditional princess awaiting rescue.\n\"George didn't want a damsel in distress, didn't want your stereotypical princess - he wanted a fighter, he wanted someone who was independent,\" Fisher explained to the BBC in 1977.\nThere is only one problem with Lucas's claim. Female Mexican revolutionaries are not known for their hairstyles - or certainly not hairstyles of that sort.\n\"As much as I would like to say that Princess Leia's hairstyle was based on the 'soldaderas' from the Mexican Revolution, this was probably not the case,\" Tabea Linhard, author of Fearless women in the Mexican Revolution and the Spanish Civil War, told the BBC.\n\"If you take a look at photos from the period, you see women with long braids, some wear hats, on occasion they cover their hair with a shawl.\n\"Conditions on the battlefields were harsh, and the women's task included carrying supplies, taking care of all the men's needs, serving as spies or smugglers; some also participated in battle.\n\"So a hairstyle like Leia's probably was not a convenient option.\"\nHowever, the hairstyle does appear to have roots in North American history.\nKendra Van Cleave of Frock Flicks, a website which reviews the accuracy of costumes in historical dramas, told the BBC that while such buns had been fashionable in medieval Europe, the \"most obvious\" inspiration is the \"squash blossom\" style worn by women of the Hopi tribe in Arizona.\nShe said: \"This consists of two side arrangements which aren't actually buns - they're more loops of hair.\n\"The hair is parted in the centre, then wrapped around a U-shaped 'hair bow' made of wood. The hair is wrapped in a figure of eight pattern, then tied at the middle and spread out to create the two semi-circles.\n\"This hairstyle became more widely known in the early 20th century due to photography,\" says Ms Van Cleave, who adds it saw a revival in the 1920s.\n\"Of course, the 1920s was an era when women in the Western hemisphere were shaking up traditional gender roles - American women got the vote in 1920, and were attending college and taking on professional employment in unprecedented numbers.\n\"Many of the arty, bohemian women of the 1920s adopted 'ethnic' fashion as a means of demonstrating their difference from the mainstream and therefore as a feminist statement.\"", "In the first two decades of his rule Libya became the world's pariah, as the flamboyant colonel used his country's oil wealth to support groups such as the Irish Republican Army and the Palestine Liberation Organisation.\nWestern enmity towards Libya reached a peak in 1988 when Pan Am Flight 103 exploded over Scotland killing 270 people.  It would be 15 years before Libya admitted responsibility.\nEventually it was his own people, helped by Western military effort who rose up and finally removed him from power.\nMuammar Abu Minyar al-Gaddafi was born into a Bedouin family on 7 June 1942, near the Libyan city of Sirte.\nAs a teenager, he became an admirer of the Egyptian leader, Gamal Abdel Nasser, whose brand of Arab Nationalism struck a chord with the young Gaddafi.\nHe first hatched plans to topple the monarchy of King Idris, while at military college, and received further army training in Britain.\nAs Captain Gaddafi, he returned to the Libyan city of Benghazi and, on 1 Sep 1969, launched a bloodless coup while the king was receiving medical treatment in Turkey.\nGaddafi became chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council which was set up to run the country - one of his first acts was to expel his country's Italian population.\nLike Nasser, he did not promote himself to the rank of General, as is the custom of most military dictators, but remained a Colonel throughout his rule. This fitted in with his idea of Libya being \"ruled by the people\".\nHe laid out his political philosophy in the 1970s in his Green Book, which charted a home-grown alternative to both socialism and capitalism, combined with aspects of Islam.\nHis rule blended Arab nationalism with a socialist welfare state and popular democracy, although the democracy did not allow for any challenge to his own position as leader.\nWhile small business were allowed to remain in private hands, the state ran the big organisations, including the oil industry.\nNo-one doubted that he exercised total control, and was ruthless in dealing with anyone who stepped out of line and opposed him.\nGaddafi believed in a union of Arab states and set out to extend Libya's influence throughout the region.\nHe began by trying to merge Libya with Egypt and Syria but disagreement over the conditions rendered it impossible. A similar arrangement with Tunisia also floundered.\nThe Muammar Gaddafi story\nThe Gaddafi family tree\nGaddafi's strong support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation also harmed his relations with Egypt which had reached a peace deal with Israel.\nHe sent Libyan forces into the neighbouring country of Chad in 1973 in order to occupy the disputed Aouzou Strip. Eventually this led to a full-scale Libyan invasion and a war that only ended in 1987.\nIn 1977 he invented a system called the \"Jamahiriya\" or \"state of the masses\", in which power is meant to be held by thousands of \"peoples' committees\".\nHis committees called for the assassination of Libyan dissidents living abroad and, during the 1980s, sent hit squads to murder them.\nGaddafi's regime was accused of serious human rights abuses\nLibya had a law forbidding group activity based on a political ideology opposed to Gaddafi's revolution.\nCampaign group Human Rights Watch claimed the regime has imprisoned hundreds of people  and sentenced some to death. Torture and disappearances have also been reported.\nBy the early 1980s Gaddafi's support for a diverse collection of revolutionary groups brought him into conflict with the West\nThe UK broke off relations with Libya in 1984, after the killing of Police Constable Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan Embassy in London.\nTwo years later, the United States bombed Tripoli and Benghazi as a reprisal for alleged Libyan involvement in the bombing of a Berlin nightclub used by American military personnel.\nLibya was reportedly a major financier of the \"Black September\" Palestinian group that was responsible, among others, for the kidnap and killing of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics, as well as becoming a supplier of weapons to the IRA.\nThe Lockerbie bombing eventually triggered a change in the relationship between Gaddafi's regime and the west, although it was 11 years before Gaddafi agreed to hand over the two Libyan nationals who had been indicted for the crime.\nAnxious for foreign investment as the price of oil fell, Gaddafi renounced terrorism. A compensation deal for the families of the Lockerbie victims was agreed and UN sanctions on Libya were lifted.\nMonths later, Gaddafi's regime abandoned efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction, triggering a fuller rapprochement with the West.\nAmerican sanctions were also lifted and Libya was reported to be helping western intelligence services in their fight against al-Qaeda\nIn a climate of rapprochement, then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair went to Libya to meet Gaddafi in a Bedouin tent on the outskirts of Tripoli in 2004.\nHowever, some in the West questioned this new relationship. And in parts of the Arab world, Gaddafi was criticised for cosying up to his old adversaries.\nGaddafi's eccentricity was legendary: He had a bodyguard of woman soldiers, and an almost narcissistic interest in his wardrobe. On one occasion reporters called to a news conference found him ploughing a field.\nA tent was also used to receive visitors in Libya, where Gaddafi sat through meetings or interviews swishing the air with a horsehair or palm leaf fly-swatter.\nThere was also growing unrest among ordinary Libyans who claimed reforms were slow in coming and said they were not benefiting from Libya's wealth. Many public services remained poor and corruption was rife.\nThat unrest boiled over in 2011 when, spurred on by the toppling of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, and Tunisia's Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, demonstrators took to the streets demanding the end of the Gaddafi regime.\nSecurity forces, including African mercenaries hired by Gaddafi, clashed with anti-government protesters with reports the Libyan air force jets had bombed opposition areas. Hundreds of people were reported to have been killed.\nThis prompted the UN Security Council to authorise the use of force and Nato countries immediately started bombing loyalist positions.\nGradually, with Nato help, the rag-tag opposition forces advanced across the country, seized the capital, Tripoli, in August and set up a transitional government.\nGaddafi remained at large until 20 October, when he was finally located and killed in his home town of Sirte.\nAfter all his bluster and bravado the longest serving leader in both Africa and the Arab world met an ignominious end.", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nIan Parkhill scored the opener on the half hour, pouncing after home keeper Stefan McCusker had fumbled Jamie McGonigle's shot.\nUnited levelled on 57 minutes through Adam Leckey's glancing header.\nBut a fine 84th-minute strike by Rodney Brown gave Coleraine their first ever Premiership win at Ferney Park.\nIt meant a fourth successive league defeat for Ballinamallard who are ninth in the table.\nFront man Parkhill had started the match because leading scorer James McLaughlin was injured in the warm-up.\nHe snapped up the opening goal after McCusker failed to hold on to McGonigle's low shot.\nBallinamallard should have scored before the break but James McCartney shot wide from just a few yards out.\nHowever, the hosts did equalise as big midfielder Leckey headed in from a Jason McCartney corner.\nColeraine secured the victory when Brown got his fifth goal of the season with a superbly-struck shot.\nColeraine manager Oran Kearney: \"We never get it easy here and it is great to come away with the three points for the first time.\n\"It was disappointing to concede from the corner because we aim to limit teams at set pieces.\n\"But our players found some energy and strength of character from somewhere and found another gear.\n\"We had other chances before Rodney scored with what was a great strike.\"", "Or should they be breaking down complex political subjects and putting them in simpler terms to get more potential voters interested?\nThese were some of the ideas being bandied around at an event in Portcullis House in Westminster to mark the end of Parliament Week.\nThe event host, UK Cosmopolitan editor-in-chief Louise Court, told the audience of young women that while the 2010 general election was seen as the \"Mumsnet\" election, this time round, they want it to be \"millennial\" voters - people currently aged between 18 and 32 - calling the shots.\nBut while these women feel \"really strongly about issues\", they can't find politicians who are speaking for them, Ms Court said.\nMany want to vote but are not registered to do so. Apparently only 44% of 18-24 year-olds voted in the 2010 election.\nOne rather alarming poll she had seen suggested that could drop to just 12% next year - although some doubts were voiced about that one.\nA straw poll of the room showed that wasn't the case here: most hands shot up when asked who was registered. But then, events like this attract those young adults who are already a bit political.\nAmong those present was 26-year-old singer-songwriter Eliza Doolittle, who has become involved with the Bite the Ballot campaign to get more young people registered to vote.\nShe is a newcomer to politics and told the audience that while she didn't \"know every single politician\", she felt she could not relate to those she saw every day, and was considering spoiling her ballot if none of the options appealed.\nBinita Mehta, a 24-year-old Watford councillor, said young women could make a difference on local issues but added: \"Maybe we have got to do a bit of wiki-research to learn what politics is about.\"\nShe urged Ms Doolittle not to spoil her ballot. \"I'm going to inform myself to the point where I hope I don't have to,\" the singer replied.\nRadio One DJ Gemma Cairney, 29, said that for many of her generation, politics was a \"complete other world\", which many could not even get up the energy to feel let down by.\nMany were in debt - which created a whole new reason not to register to vote. \"They are afraid to register because that means the bailiffs know where they live,\" she said.\nBut what can politicians do to appeal to \"millennial\" voters?\nPerhaps more party political videos on YouTube? Or at least the \"real\" version of Newsnight interviews - with subtitles breaking down what politicians are really saying.\nPerhaps more of a focus on \"young\" policies - and less obsession with pensions and inheritance tax might help?\nSome suggested politicians should \"care less\" about how they are portrayed in the media.\nA word of warning came from Daily Telegraph columnist Bryony Gordon: young voters don't want to see \"dad dancing\" and politicians hanging out with celebrities.\nEven getting on Twitter can be risky - with one person suggesting that David Cameron's Twitter account \"seems a bit like a robot\".\nThe subject of whether Russell Brand should be employed as some sort of ambassador for youth proved divisive. He's not to everyone's tastes.\nAnd the \"pantomime farce\" of Prime Minister's Questions impressed no-one on the panel - instead, cross-bencher Baroness Young of Hornsey suggested more consensus and grown-up conversations away from \"ideological bias\" might engage people more.\nSexism in the male-dominated corridors of power was highlighted by columnist Ms Gordon.\nShe said she had once been called a \"slut\" to her face by an MP who went on to become a minister.\n\"You have to sweep that culture out,\" she said - and using quotas to get more women into Parliament was one way to do it.\nMP Margot James said that while she was \"lukewarm\" on all-women shortlists, Labour's use of them had seen \"the terms of the debate change\". About 22% of MPs are women - \"20% of us is not enough\", she said.\n\"I think it's quite damaging for democracy.\"\nThere was a lot of feeling in the room that not enough was being done to educate children about politics from an early age.

Walmart was having trouble keeping goods stocked in their stores,\" Professor Ken Jacobs, head of the University of California-Berkeley's Labor Center, told the BBC.\n\"But I don't think McDonald's, without all the protests, would have acted.\n\"I think the workers [who], really quite courageously, went out on strike have really inspired and moved something that's very big and will have long-term repercussions.\"\nLawrence Yancy, a lifelong Chicagoan, has worked in fast food since he graduated high school in 1989, after which he got a job at Wendy's.\nHe is just one of many workers here who are frustrated with the gap between how much McDonald's executives are paid versus the restaurant employees.\n\"I'm tired of struggling all the time,\" he told the BBC during a break from the protests at his small and slightly run-down one bedroom apartment in the Kimball neighbourhood. The area is close to Hyde Park, near where US President Barack Obama lives.\nHe has worked as a grill cook at a Chicago McDonald's since January 2003 and says he was inspired to join the movement after labour organisers visited his store last year as part of an effort by the Service Employees International Union to get fast food workers to join a union.\nHe says he is frustrated that his wages have barely budged from the $5.50 per hour he started making when he first joined the company, to the $8.40 he makes now.\n\"I just want to be able to save - and maybe buy some new clothes,\" he said.\nMcDonald's has dismissed the protests as not being indicative of workers at the firm and its franchises more generally.\nThis \"is the latest instance in an $80m publicity campaign organized and paid for by the Service Employees International Union and its members,\" said the company in a statement.\n\"As has been the case in earlier protests, very few McDonald's or independent franchisee employees are participating.\"\nBut many shareholders took pictures of the protests as they headed into the meeting - which could further add to investor concerns, as well as influencing voting at the meeting.\nLate on Wednesday, large institutional investors released a letter calling for McDonald's and other firms to amend the way investors can decide who sits on the company's board through a move known as \"proxy access\".\nThe investors include the California Public Employees' Retirement System (Calpers) and the New York City Pension Funds - who control a combined $860bn in assets.\nThe heads of pension funds in New York City, Chicago, and California wrote in a letter that the move was an effort to challenge the company's decision to buy back shares to please investors, at the expense of long-term growth.\n\"McDonalds is facing serious performance challenges. But despite a recently announced and much needed turnaround plan, the company continues to direct capital towards an aggressive share buyback programme,\" they wrote in a letter.\nThey said that these buybacks should instead be directed at increasing worker wages, in addition to being reinvested in the company.\nMcDonald's urged shareholders to vote against the move. Despite the opposition, 61% of voting shareholders approved the proxy access bylaw.\n\"We'll be evaluating the advisory vote, and the board will consider it to determine what's appropriate,\" McDonald's said in a statement.", "\"Good morning! We have a new constituent assembly!\" began President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as he greeted his supporters in the Plaza Bol\u00edvar in Caracas shortly after the electoral authorities announced the result.\nThe country's National Electoral Council said that just a little over eight million ballots had been cast for members of a a new assembly designed to change the country's constitution, a turnout of 41.53% of the electorate.\nBut the opposition boycotted the vote, guaranteeing victory for the country's socialist government, which had convened the vote. Amid the electoral violence, at least 10 deaths were reported across the country.\nHowever President Maduro faces a real challenge of governability and credibility.\nPerhaps the biggest is that every opposition supporter, and many millions of ordinary Venezuelans, simply do not believe the result.\n\"The government will claim eight million votes, but in reality it could have been about 3.5 million people,\" predicted pollster Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n a day before the poll.\nThe opposition say several irregular electoral processes took place that in normal Venezuelan elections would not be allowed.\nFor example, no indelible ink was used to mark voters' little fingers after the ballots had been cast and critics say there was nothing to stop people voting in more than one polling centre.\nThere were also widespread reports of pressure being brought to bear on government employees to turn out in order to protect their jobs.\nSeveral countries in the region - including Colombia, Argentina and Panama - said they would not recognise the result.\nThe United States also threatened \"strong and swift action\", with the US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, calling the vote a \"sham election\" that brought Venezuela \"another step toward dictatorship\".\nNevertheless, the Maduro government is treating this result as a resounding endorsement and will press ahead with its plans to change the constitution. The first steps towards creating the new body could take place within 24 hours.\nIn part, the difficulty the Maduro government has faced in motivating its base stems from the many years they spent vociferously defending the same constitution they are now urgently trying to change.\nHugo Ch\u00e1vez himself often described the 1999 Constitution in sacred terms, comparing it to the Bible or the Mayan holy text, Popol Vuh.\nThe approach of most government officials has been twofold.\nIn part, they say the creation of a constituent assembly is the easiest route to peace - something that most ordinary Venezuelans are desperate to see return to their daily lives.\nThey also argue that this constitutional change is part of a vision of a \"deeper\" form of popular democracy that the late socialist leader was never able to fully realise before his death in 2013.\nIf so, however, he never made any great references to it while he was still alive: \"Our constitution, one of the best in the world, is protected from the caprice of any political group,\" he said in 2008.\n\"In Venezuela, no-one can change a comma, a full stop, a letter of our Bolivarian Constitution. Only the Venezuelan people can do that through a national referendum,\" Mr Ch\u00e1vez explained.\nA pro-government candidate standing in a low-income neighbourhood in the east of Caracas, Joaquin Mijares, denied that the vote was unconstitutional.\n\"The constituent assembly will be a space to discuss the direction of the country and how the state is organised,\" he said outside his local polling station.\n\"The process is legitimate because we, the people, are legitimising it with our participation.\"\nHowever, the haemorrhaging of traditional Chavista support goes beyond this one controversial political process. It comes after months of food shortages, rampant inflation and worsening violence.\nOne does not have to look hard for signs of public exhaustion with the Maduro government.\n\"Sadly, my President, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, died. Very sadly, because if he were alive, none of this would be happening,\" said Beatriz, a housewife in Catia, in western Caracas.\n\"I'll stay Chavista until the very end but I'm no Maduro supporter,\" she added.  It is a position shared by many others among the nation's poor.\nThere is a uniquely Venezuelan word to describe the street closures and subsequent clashes with the authorities: \"guarimba\".\nNow, with the votes cast, there is still no sign of the barricades and protests letting up.\nIf anything, positions are becoming more entrenched. \"The Resistance\" - a loose alliance of young, radicalised opposition protesters - have vowed to remain on the streets until the government concedes to their demands.\n\"We're going to be here until this country changes, until it improves, until the government falls,\" a 17-year-old protester manning the barricades told me.\n\"We need a president who's dignified enough to be called the president of Venezuela and an end to the shortages and queues.\"\nThe traditional opposition alliance, the MUD, also appears to remain committed to a campaign of demonstrations and civil disobedience. The government places the blame for the violence firmly at the door of the opposition.\nBut the head of the National Assembly, Julio Borges, denied that the MUD was responsible for leading the country down a path towards further conflict.\n\"We are not involved in a civil war in Venezuela,\" he said. \"What we have in Venezuela is one people, one nation that is against a minority that has kidnapped power in the country.\"\nOn the other side, the military and the security forces are not backing down either. Despite suggestions of disillusionment among some sectors of the rank and file, there is little hard evidence of a genuine split or mutiny.\nBoth before the vote and in his victory speech, President Maduro spoke of dialogue. Some nations have been trying to table negotiations between the two sides with figures like former Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero attempting to broker some form of peace.\nSpain, in particular, would want to see a stable Venezuela sooner rather than later, given its business interests in the South American nation.\nHowever, there is little sign of a breakthrough. If anything, the decision to plough ahead with the election, despite widespread opposition, may have jeopardised any chance of further conversations for the time being.\nFurthermore, despite the unity in the name of the opposition alliance, in reality the parties remain divided, split and without a clear leader who inspires Venezuelans. As such, the immediate outlook is bleak, says Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n.\n\"It's absolutely going to get worse before it improves.\"\n\"The two groups both think they are in power. They both think they are going to destroy the other, that they are going to pulverise each other.\"\nSuch \"mutually assured destruction\", he argues, does nothing to tackle the problems of inflation, scarcity, poverty, lack of medicines and so on that have plagued Venezuela in recent years.\nIt seems, at least in the short term, Venezuelans face an unenviable and uncertain period as their country continues its gradual descent into anarchy.", "The 32-year-old talks of the pride she feels in leading a business that has been run by her family for 88 years.\nThe store in the southern Indian city of Chennai was first opened by her great-great-grandfather in 1928.\nOver the decades Nalli has become one of India's best-known brands of saris. The traditional Indian garment for women, saris are lengths of wide fabric which are first wrapped around the waist and then draped over one shoulder.\nLavanya says the brand's heritage and reputation for selling the finest silk saris are central to its continuing appeal.\nAnd with annual revenues of more than $100m (\u00a376m) across 29 Indian stores, plus outlets in Singapore and California, business remains strong.\nYet as a growing number of Indian women are choosing to wear Western clothing, or less formal Indian garments, Lavanya is using business skills she gained from spending several years away from the family company to introduce new product lines and take the firm into e-commerce.\nNalli is renowned for selling hand-woven silk saris, which are made from the artisan weavers in the Kanchipuram district of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.\nThese saris are known for their opulence, their fine fabric, vibrant colours and intricate designs, which range from floral and peacock motifs to checks and stripes.\nThey are popular as special occasion wear for celebrations, festivals and marriages, and the most beautiful are passed on from one generation to the next.\nThey are also not cheap, with the most intricate examples costing as much as $3,100 (\u00a32,350).\nAs a child Lavanya says it was impossible for her not to take an interest in both the company and retailing in general, because her father and grandfather would forever discuss business at the dinner table.\n\"Work and personal life were amazingly integrated,\" she says.\nLavanya herself formally joined the business in 2005, when she was 21. She stayed for four years, before deciding that she wanted to leave to learn about different ways of doing things.\nSo she first went to the prestigious Harvard Business School in the US to get an MBA (master of business administration).\nShe then worked with business consulting firm McKinsey in Chicago from 2011 to 2013.\nReturning to India in 2014, she then spent a year with an online fashion retailer called Myntra, before finally rejoining the family business in 2015.\nWith all the experience she had gained while she was away, she says her family were happy to let her take the lead at Nalli.\nThe challenge Lavanya faces is responding to the continuing change in the fashion tastes of Indian women, which is seeing many of them wear saris far less often.\n\"Saris were the only choice and preference Indian women had for a very long time, and that has changed over the years,\" she says.\nWhile saris still dominate on Indian city streets, it doesn't take long to spot young women in Western casual wear such as jeans, t-shirts and shirts.\nThey are buying these from shops opened in India by the likes of Sweden's H&M, and US chain Gap.\nLess formal Indian clothing such as kurtis (a stitched long shirt) and salwar kameez (dresses) have also grown in popularity, especially on college campuses and in the workplace.\nAmit Gugnani, a fashion expert at Indian management consultancy business Technopak, explains the growing challenge for companies like Nalli.\nHe says: \"Indian fashion consumers have become more experimental and image-conscious.\n\"A strong and growing economy coupled with better job prospects, higher disposable income and profound impact of media and technology is revolutionising [the] buying behaviour of Indian consumers.\n\"It is a fairly large challenge to be able to cater to the modern day Indian consumer - it is a fine balance between understanding the consumer and educating them at the same time about the offering your brand has.\"\nWhile Nalli has no plans to introduce Western-style clothing, under Lavanya's direction it has launched a range of kurtis and salwar kameez.\nThe company has also launched a range of more affordable saris, made from cheaper fabrics, such as a blend of polyester and cotton. This has brought prices down to as low as $2.20 per sari, a fraction of the price of the most expensive silk versions.\nLavanya says that while saris remain the \"major revenue generator for the company\", Nalli has \"adopted the changing preference of consumers\".\nWhile Lavanya has led the development of the company's website, to enable sales from around the world, she still intends for the business to double its number of physical stores by 2020.\nShe says her family continues to support her efforts, particularly because she provides detailed business plans.\n\"Our set-up is very entrepreneurial, which allows us to keep thinking about different ways of doing things,\" says Lavanya.\n\"So whenever I have an inclination or hunch, I find data that validates my hypothesis. This makes me more confident to chase it further, and my family supports it.\n\"I'm really grateful to be in the position that I am in today. There is a deep sense of pride to be part of a historic brand that my family has built.\"", "Warwick University researchers studied geo-tagged tweets and mobile phone use over a two-month period in Milan.\nIn two locations with known visitor numbers - a football stadium and an airport - these activities rose and fell in close step with flow of people.\nThe team said it could enable measurement of events such as protests.\nOther researchers emphasised that there were limitations and biases within this type of data - for example, only a subset of the population uses smartphones and Twitter and not all areas are well served by mobile phone towers.\nBut the study's authors said the results were \"a very good starting point\" for making more of these estimates - with greater accuracy - in the future.\n\"These are the numbers - the calibration examples - that we can draw on,\" said co-author Dr Tobias Preis. \"Obviously it would be even better if there were training examples in other countries, other environments, other time periods. Human behaviour is not constant around the globe.\n\"But it's a very, very good base to build on, to provide initial estimates.\"\nThe work, published in the journal Royal Society Open Science, is part of a big and growing research field exploring what online activity can reveal about human behaviour and other real-world phenomena.\nFederico Botta, the PhD student who led the analysis, said the mobile phone-based approach had advantages over other methods for estimating crowd sizes.\n\"This is very quick,\" Mr Botta told BBC News. \"It does not rely on human judgement, it only relies on having the data related to mobile phones, or Twitter activity.\"\nWithin two months of mobile data provided by Telecom Italia as part of its Big Data Challenge, Mr Botta and his colleagues concentrated on Linate Airport and the San Siro football stadium, home to both AC Milan and Inter Milan.\nThey compared the number of people known to be in those two places, based on flight schedules and football ticket sales, with three measures of mobile phone activity: the number of phonecalls and text messages, the amount of internet use, and volume of tweets.\n\"What we saw was that indeed these activities\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 had a strikingly similar behaviour to the number of people,\" Mr Botta said.\nThis may not seem surprising - but particularly within the football stadium, the team saw such a reliable pattern that they could make predictions.\nThere were 10 football matches during the analysis period. Based on data from any nine of those games, the researchers could predict how many were at the tenth game based purely on mobile internet data.\nBut how accurate were they?\n\"Our mean absolute percentage error is about 13%,\" Mr Botta said. \"That means that our estimate and the actual number of people differ in absolute value by roughly 13%.\"\nThis is pretty good, the team said, compared with traditional techniques that rely on images, grids and human judgement. They pointed to the famous example of the 1995 \"Million Man March\" in Washington DC, where even the most careful analysis could only produce an estimate to within 20% - after initial statements varied wildly from 400,000 to 2 million.\nCo-author Dr Suzy Moat said the football stadium results were even better than the team had hoped.\n\"This is the kind of thing you really hope you'll find, and you're not normally lucky enough to see,\" she told the BBC. \"It's really striking that we're seeing quite such a close correspondence between the telecommunications data and the crowd size estimates.\"\nDr Ed Manley is a lecturer at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at University College London. He said this technique had a lot of potential and that people should be \"optimistic but cautious\" about using phone data in this way.\n\"We've got these massive data sets and there's a lot to be done with them... But we need to remain cautious about how far we push the data,\" Dr Manley said.\nHe explained that it would be important to remember that data from smartphones would not measure the population evenly.\n\"There are potentially biases there. Who are we measuring in these data sets?\" Twitter, he noted as an example, has a relatively young and affluent user base.\nDr Manley also said it would be important to choose the measurement carefully because people use mobiles for different things in different places - perhaps more for phonecalls at the airport and for tweets at the football, for example.\nAnd crucially, the whole analysis hinges on mobile phone signal - which is notoriously variable from place to place, and prone to dropping out.\n\"If we're relying on these data sets to tell us where people are, what happens when we have a problem with the way that data is collected?\" Dr Manley said.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter.", "While the search has been going on, more than 20 pieces of possible debris have been found by members of the public, on the African coast and islands in the Indian Ocean. Most have been handed in to French authorities or the Australian Transport Safety Bureau which has been co-ordinating the search (ATSB).\nSo far only a handful have been confirmed as \"definitely\" or \"almost certainly\" from the doomed plane.\nThe flaperon was the first piece of potential debris found. In September 2015 French judicial authorities who examined it confirmed it did come from MH370. One of three numbers found on the part matched up with the plane's serial number, 9M-MRO.\nInvestigators say this piece has identification numbers belonging to parts that were uniquely made for Malaysia Airlines and incorporated into MH370's plane.\nOne of the largest pieces of debris found so far, this piece had identification numbers and date stamps tallying with those belonging to MH370 parts.\nAlso known as \"676EB\", this piece has a stencilled number with the same font and colour used by Malaysia Airlines. Investigators also found that the part had been repainted, which matched the maintenance records for MH370.\nThe ATSB says the stencilling of the words \"No Step\" is consistent with that used by Malaysia Airlines. It also has a fastener matching those used in assembly of aircraft next in the production line of MH370's aircraft.\nThis piece carries the logo of Rolls-Royce which manufactures parts for Boeing. The ATSB says the stencil closely matched that used on other Boeing-777s owned by Malaysian Airlines.\nATSB investigators say that the presence of a hinge and a trim line indicate this was likely part of a closet panel that contained a foldable work-table. Its decorative pattern also matches that of Malaysia Airlines' Boeing-777 aircraft, and is not used by any other airlines' Boeing-777s.\nMany pieces of debris are still being evaluated for links to MH370.\nThese include items found by Blaine Gibson, an American lawyer who has gone on self-funded expeditions around the world to look for MH370 debris. Among other things, in Madagascar he found a seat back panel that could have housed a monitor.\nThese pieces initially sparked speculation that a fire had broken out onboard MH370, as they appear to have burn marks or discolouration caused by burning.\nBut the ATSB found that the discolouration was caused by the presence of resin. One item had small marks from \"localised heating\", but it was unclear how those marks were made.\nAustralian authorities have cast doubt on the fire theory and say work is still ongoing to determine if these pieces belong to a Boeing-777 aircraft.\nAnother piece found on Kangaroo Island in Australia in June 2016, which had the words \"Caution No Step\" stencilled on it, was thought to confirm that the aeroplane went down in the \"seventh arc\" of the southern Indian Ocean, where search efforts have focused on.\nThe ATSB said later that the piece did not match Boeing manufacturing specifications and thus could not have come from a Boeing aircraft.", "The 24-year-old former Poland Under-21 international joined Town from Polish side Korona Kielce on a two-year contract in the summer.\nBut he has been restricted to just six appearances and moves to a team currently ninth in League One.\nMeanwhile, Ipswich have extended midfielder Ben Pringle's loan from Fulham until the end of the season.\nThe 26-year-old has made seven appearances for Mick McCarthy's side since joining in February, scoring in 1-0 wins over Huddersfield and Nottingham Forest.\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.", "The Russian foreign minister criticised the \"counter-productive\" nature of Moldova's \"unfriendly actions\".\nThe diplomats, who were not named, were given three days to leave Russia.\nMoldova's pro-EU government has not explained the expulsions.

All three were found dead on 12 October, 2014.\nThe serious case review reported that on Friday 3 October, 2014 Mrs Galikowska, a Polish national, was seen by a GP with husband Marcin, who made the appointment after becoming concerned about his wife's mental state.\nAfter Mrs Galikowska admitted having thoughts about killing herself and her children, the GP referred her to mental health professionals and told her they should contact her later that day.\nThe doctor was told \"urgent referrals service-users will be contacted within four hours\", the review said.\nBut, neither the GP nor the call taker referred the case to children's social care and as a result professionals did not visit the family until Sunday 5 October.\nThe serious case review concluded this referral should have been made and the case would then have been \"treated correctly\" as a child protection investigation.\nFurther telephone calls were made on 6 October, but after a surprise visit on 7 October the mother's mental health was not judged to have deteriorated and the mental health service announced it was closing the case two days later.\nThe review criticised the \"extremely concerning\" delay between the GP's referral and mental health workers visiting the family and described further telephone calls in place of home visits as \"poor practice\".\n\"There is a pattern in Stoke-on-Trent of professionals making assumptions about other teams/agencies' roles, responses and remit, which can leave families vulnerable and both professionals and families with false expectations,\" it

And they won't know for some time.\nThere's been widespread scepticism amongst IT experts I've spoken to, including former BA IT workers, that the airline's current explanation of a \"local power surge\" could truly have wreaked such havoc.", "Greenbank (IOM) wanted permission in principle to build up to 200 houses and a 100-bed care unit on the site.\nIt claimed more than 60 permanent jobs would be created and about \u00c2\u00a3500,000-a-year generated for the local economy.\nThe committee moved to reject the plans but a full council meeting will now decide on whether they can progress.\nThe developers have offered more than \u00c2\u00a3250,000 towards upgrading water and drainage infrastructure in the area.\nThey have also said they would construct a \"fully equipped\" youth centre on the site.\nHowever, planning officers remained unconvinced by the proposals.\nThey said the development was outside the \"settlement boundary\" for Gretna and there were not sufficient grounds to allocate the land for development.", "The Boundary Commission for Scotland is consulting on proposals to create three new constituencies.\nFears raised include difficulties for MPs servicing larger constituencies and the break-up of traditional areas.\nThe commission, whose consultation runs until 11 January, said it recognised \"there may be tensions in some areas\" over the planned changes.\nUK Parliament boundaries are to be changed under plans to reduce the number of MPs from 650 to 600.\nNo changes are to be made to the boundary of the Western Isles constituency, Na h-Eileanan an Iar.\nThe three new Highlands constituencies are to be known as Argyll, Bute and Lochaber; Inverness and Skye; and Highland North.\nThe seat of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey is to be largely absorbed into the new Inverness and Skye. Part of Lochaber would form Argyll, Bute and Lochaber.\nHighland North would be the UK's largest-ever constituency, covering Caithness, Sutherland, Wester Ross and Easter Ross.\nHighland councillor Audrey Sinclair said it would be difficult for an MP to service such a big area.\nShe said: \"I feel sorry for the constituents because just how often would they see an MP?\n\"Also, the person who is actually elected would have a very difficult job to make sure that they do cover all the area.\"\nLyn Kilpatrick, of Kilmallie in Lochaber, said communities and community assets would be lost from the traditional area of Lochaber.\nThe boundary changes would, for example, see the base of Lochaber Rugby Club inside the new constituency of Inverness and Skye, she said.\nShe added: \"It may seem a marginal issue, but I think it is important. The commission says itself that it tries to retain people's traditional communities and people's sense of who they are and what they belong to for UK parliamentary purposes.\"\nFull reviews of UK Parliament constituencies are carried out every five years and Scottish Parliament boundaries about every 10 years, with interim reviews of selected areas sooner if considered necessary.\nIsobel Drummond Murray, of the Boundary Commission, said: \"Part of the change is to balance a legislative requirement with coming up with sensible proposals.\n\"There may be tensions in some areas and Scotland certainly has challenging geography in places and the commission is aware of these challenges.\"", "The 26-year-old, drafted to Indianapolis in 2012, is now contracted to the Colts until the end of the 2021 season.\nLuck's wages take him above the annual average of $22.1m collected by Joe Flacco of the Baltimore Ravens, the previous record earner.\n\"I am thrilled and excited,\" Luck said.\nThe Colts made the play-offs in Luck's first three seasons with them but he suffered an injury-hit 2015, missing two early matches with a shoulder problem before suffering a lacerated kidney that ruled him out after week nine.\nColts owner Jim Irsay said: \"This is an exciting day for the organisation and Colts fans around the globe.\n\"Andrew is the consummate professional, possesses extraordinary talent and is our leader on and off the field.\"", "A further 13 people from the student wing of the Awami League were sentenced to life in prison for murdering Biswajit Das.\nProsecutors said they mistook him for a supporter of the opposition.\nThe murder in broad daylight was captured on TV and caused outrage.\nThe pictures showed activists chasing Mr Das in the streets of Dhaka and hacking to death him with machetes.\nPolice were severely criticised for their slow response in arresting the suspects.\nOnly eight of the accused were present in the crowded court to hear judge  ABM Nizamul Huq read out the verdict.\nThe rest, including two of those condemned to death, have not been caught and were tried in absentia.\nThe victim's elder brother Uttam Das was quoted by the AFP agency as saying that the family was happy with the verdict and wanted the executions to be speedily carried out.\n\"We have got the justice and now we want quick execution of these  criminals,\" Mr Das said.\nCorrespondents say that the trial was a major test for the Awami League and came amid allegations that police tried to cover up the identities of the attackers.\nThe verdicts came as the country reels from street violence over the last few weeks ahead of polls scheduled for 5 January.\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies say that they will boycott the vote - which they insist should only be held after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has stepped aside to make way for a neutral caretaker government.\nThey have held a series of violent strikes and street protests to advance their demands.", "20-year-old Tutton came very close to winning a medal in the 200m breaststroke final at Rio 2016.\nShe has not been selected to go to the Worlds in Hungary after coming third in the event at the British Championships.\n\"She's in a really tough event,\" fellow Welsh swimmer Carlin said.\nCarlin continued: \"Unfortunately on the day she was third and they've taken the top two swimmers.\n\"She'll be disappointed but I definitely think that will be good motivation for her going into Commonwealth Games year.\"\nTutton finished fourth in 200m breaststroke final in Rio after winning gold at the British Olympic trials in 2016.\nAt the recent British Championship in Sheffield, however, she was third behind Jocelyn Ulyett and Molly Renshaw and will not be part of Britain's squad at July's World Championships in Hungary.\nCarlin, who won two Olympic silvers at Rio 2016, has been included in the 29-strong British Swimming team.\nThe 26-year-old failed to achieve the qualifying time in her three freestyle events despite retaining her 800m British title and has been selected on a discretionary basis.\n\"After my performances last year I thought that would put me in a better position,\" Carlin told BBC Wales Sport.\n\"I always want to qualify the right way.

That is the attitude of so many witnesses in this case.\"\nThe QC claimed it appeared that both Sir David and Mr Whyte had been \"ill served\" by their advisers at the time.\nMr Findlay said it was clear that Mr Whyte had bought the shares to takeover Rangers.\nHowever, he added: \"Was there a crime? The defence say that manifestly there was not.\"\nThe advocate then criticised the prosecution's case.\nMr Findlay said: \"A recurrent theme of what I will say to you is that the Crown approach is wrong, unfair, unjustified and unjustifiable.\n\"They are asking you to take 10 words from the indictment and that, if you look at those words, Mr Whyte is guilty.\n\"The Crown are asking you to be selective in the most selective way imaginable.\n\"That is just wrong, that is just unfair.\"\nMr Findlay claimed there had been \"buck passing, back protecting and blind eye turning\" seen during the trial.\nHe added: \"What we have to do is sweep all that away and look at it in its context and in the real world.\"\nJurors were told Mr Whyte had come along with a \"business plan\" prior to his takeover.\nReferring to Mr Whyte, the QC said: \"There have been attempts to portray Craig Whyte as a pantomime villain...that everything was fine until he came along.\n\"But, that is far from the truth. He is being made to be the fall guy.\n\"Before you do that, you have to look at the whole evidence in this case.\"\nDuring his closing argument, Mr Findlay also referred to Rangers' early Champions League exit against Swedish side Malmo after Mr Whyte took the helm at Ibrox in 2011.\nHe told the court: \"If Rangers had made the league section of the Champions League, do we actually think we would be here today?\n\"The probability is no.\"\nThe court heard claims that the defeat cost the club up to \u00a320m in lost income.\nThe QC also pointed out that there had been \"no loss\" to Sir David Murray in the buyout.\nMr Findlay spoke of the share purchase agreement, signed as part of the takeover.\nThe document makes reference to \"third party resources\".\nThe QC went on: \"What did Murray's advisers do about it? Absolutely nothing. Why not? It is because what mattered was getting the deal over the finishing line.\"\nThe trial has previously heard claims \"nothing\" was spent on \"due diligence\" into Mr Whyte's background before the buyout.\nMr Findlay said it seemed the Murray team had been \"more focused\" on securing a sale.\nThe QC later pointed to an email from Michael McGill which included reference to Whyte's \"other investors\".\nMr Findlay added: \"What is the only question if you are really concerned about the source of the money?\n\"It is \"who are they...what other investors?'.\"\nBut, Mr Findlay said the Murray side did \"absolutely nothing\" in that regard.\nHe told jurors: \"Only one conclusion can be drawn from that - it did not matter that there were other investors. It was the deal that mattered.\"\nThe court further heard the Murray team \"ought to have known\" about any role Ticketus had.\nMr Findlay claimed a \"massive organisation\" like the Murray Group could have made enquiries to \"explain what this is all about\".\nThe advocate is due to complete his speech on Monday before Judge Lady Stacey gives her legal directions to the jury.\nThe trial continues.", "Ms Monroe sued the writer over two war memorial tweets she said caused \"serious harm\" to her reputation.\nMs Hopkins posted tweets in May 2015 asking her if she had \"scrawled on any memorials recently\".\nMs Monroe said that meant she had either vandalised a war memorial or \"condoned or approved\" of it.\nMr Justice Warby also ordered Ms Hopkins - a columnist for the Mail Online - to pay an initial \u00a3107,000 towards the campaigner's legal costs within 28 days.\nHe ruled that the tweets had caused \"Ms Monroe real and substantial distress\" and she was entitled to \"fair and reasonable compensation\".\nThe final costs figure has yet to be assessed.\nCheeky interruption for BBC guest\nThe biggest killer you may not know\nUK a nation of 'mucus troopers' says TUC\nAfter the ruling, Ms Monroe, who also campaigns over poverty issues, said: \"It's taken 21 months but today the High Court ruled that Hopkins statements to/about me were defamatory.\n\"I sued her for libel, and I won.\"\nThe case arose after some Twitter users highlighted an anti-Conservative profanity daubed on a  memorial to the women of World War Two during an anti-austerity demonstration.\nIn May 2015 Ms Hopkins tweeted: \"@MsJackMonroe scrawled on any memorials recently? Vandalised the memory of those who fought for your freedom. Grandma got any more medals?\"\nThe judge ruled that the tweet \"meant that Ms Monroe condoned and approved of scrawling on war memorials, vandalising monuments commemorating those who fought for her freedom\".\nHe found that a second tweet from Ms Hopkins \"meant that Ms Monroe condoned and approved of the fact that in the course of an anti-government protest there had been vandalisation by obscene graffiti of the women's war memorial in Whitehall, a monument to those who fought for her freedom\"\nThe judge added: \"These are meanings with a defamatory tendency, which were published to thousands.\"\nJonathan Price, for Ms Hopkins, who is well known for airing controversial views, told the judge that \"this relatively trivial dispute arose and was resolved on Twitter in a period of several hours\".\nHe argued that \"no lasting harm, and certainly no serious harm\" had been caused to Ms Monroe's reputation.\nMs Hopkins had \"mistakenly\" used Ms Monroe's Twitter handle instead of that of another columnist who had written about the war memorial incident, he said.\nMs Monroe comes from a family with military connections - her father was in the British Army for seven years, while one of her brothers is a flying officer in the RAF.\nThe judge said he accepted Ms Monroe's unchallenged evidence that \"as a proud member of a military family and a feminist\" she was \"sickened\" by the graffiti.\nHe ruled that \"whilst the claimant may not have proved that her reputation suffered gravely, I am satisfied that she has established that the publications complained of caused serious harm to her reputation\".\nHe said their publication \"not only caused Ms Monroe real and substantial distress, but also harm to her reputation which was serious\".\nMedia lawyer Mark Stephens, of law firm Howard Kennedy, said Mr Justice Warby had set a \"tariff\" at \u00a324,000 for Twitter libel cases, which would \"undoubtedly encourage more claims\".\nHe said: \"The courts will allow robust debate and will consider posts and comments to see if they were meant as fact or a joke.\n\"But the fact remains that if comments cause serious harm, legal action is likely to follow.\"", "Of course the agenda can be livened-up, at short notice, by ministerial statements or urgent questions, and there are a number of very big issues coming down the track (the date of the EU referendum, the mammoth Investigatory Powers Bill, the Trident vote) but the current quiet in Westminster leaves plenty of time for leadership speculation and euro-plotting.\nHere's my rundown of the week's events:\nMonday\nThe Commons opens at 2.30pm, with Work and Pensions questions, after which any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will be taken.\nThe day's main legislating is the second reading of the Bank of England and Financial Services Bill - this deals with the governance, transparency and accountability of the Bank of England, as well as updating resolution planning and crisis management arrangements between the Bank and the Treasury.\nIt extends the senior managers and certification regime across the whole financial services industry and it extends the scope of the Pension Wise guidance service.\nOf all the scheduled events this week (there's no accounting for urgent questions or statements) the backbench debate on the future of the Financial Conduct Authority looks the most interesting; a cross party team of Guto Bebb (Conservative), John Mann (Labour) and Kirsten Oswald (SNP) has put down a motion of no confidence in the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, saying it is not fit for purpose.\nThis is a pretty unprecedented move  - I'm told the Commons clerks have been searching for a precedent without reward - I wonder if they've got back to the Honourable East India Company yet. It was sparked by the FCA's handling of a number of controversies, over interest rate swaps, and the management of the Connaught Income Fund (nearly 50 MPs - an impressive number - attended a recent adjournment debate on that issue) but most of all because the FCA has dropped plans for an inquiry into the culture of the financial services industry, a decision which has alarmed a number of MPs.\nIn Westminster Hall (from 4.30pm) MPs debate e-petition 110776 on transitional state pension arrangements for women born in the 1950s: \"The government must make fair transitional arrangements for all women born on or after 6th April 1951 who have unfairly borne the burden of the increase to the State Pension Age (SPA). Hundreds of thousands of women have had significant changes imposed on them with a lack of appropriate notification.\" Helen Jones, the chair of the Petitions Committee, will lead the debate.\nIn the Lords (from 2.30pm) there's more committee stage debate on the Immigration Bill, where the key issues include immigration detention, \"deport first appeal later\", migrant support, and family reunion. The dinner break business is a short debate on the effects of neglected tropical diseases in impairing social and economic development in developing countries.\nTuesday\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am for Business, Innovation and Skills questions - and that's followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Lib Dem former Scottish secretary, Alistair Carmichael. His Mobile Telecommunications Network Coverage (Contractual Obligations) Bill aims to strengthen the rights of consumers who purchase mobile phone contracts which do not provide the advertised service; they're promised four bars of signal in his Orkney and Shetland constituency and get none.\nAfter that, MPs have their first debate on the Enterprise Bill - which creates a Small Business Commissioner, to deal with late payment of bills. An estimated \u00a327bn is owed to small and medium-sized businesses. The bill also has measures dealing with deregulation and apprenticeships.\nIn Westminster Hall the day's debates include regional airports and UK airports capacity (9.30am-11am) and gender pricing (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (from 2.30pm) there will be ping-pong on two bills from the Commons: the Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill - where no vote is expected, but key issues are housing and the Charity Commission. Then peers turn to ping-pong on the Childcare Bill - Labour is working on getting into scope a report on the effectiveness of the government's childcare proposals - and they may force that issue to a vote.\nThen peers turn to an important statutory instrument: the Feed-in Tariffs (Amendment) Order, a measure which effectively cuts the subsidies to various forms of green energy; there's a Labour regret motion and a Lib Dem fatal motion, which Labour will abstain on.\nWednesday\nThe Commons opens at 11.30am, with International Development questions, followed, at noon by  Prime Minister's Question Time - first in the batting order is Labour awkward squaddie John Mann, one of those behind Monday's debate on the FCA; anyone care to bet against him raising the issue with the PM?\nPMQs is followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Automatic Electoral Registration, from the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, to ensure the accuracy of electoral registers. The bill proposes to automatically register everyone accessing a public service (that is everyone who applies for a driving license, everyone who has a National Insurance number, or receives a benefit), thereby making it much easier to keep an accurate and complete register.\nShe quotes estimates that the government's new system of Individual Voter Registration will lead to one million voters falling off the electoral register: the bill proposes to reverse this trend.\nThe day's main debates are on Labour motions on tax avoidance and multinational companies - and then on public finances in Scotland. And that's followed by an adjournment debate on child dental health, led by the Conservative, Sir Paul Beresford. Tooth decay is one of the main reasons young children arrive at A&E, and the House's resident dentist will explore the issue.\nIn Westminster Hall, the day's debates include: fuel poverty (9.30am- 11am); Bryan Evans and the Serious Fraud Office (11am- 11.30am); and government investment in cycling (4.30 -5.30pm).\nMy eye was caught by the debate on changes to the level of local government funding (2.30pm - 4pm). Former Labour leadership contender Liz Kendall will open a general debate, designed to encourage as many MPs as possible to raise their particular concerns about the future of local government in an era of austerity.\nIn the Lords, the main business is the continuation of detailed committee stage consideration of the Immigration Bill, where peers will be looking at the issues of unaccompanied refugee children, border security and language requirements for public sector workers. During the dinner break, the House will consider a Lib Dem regret motion on the Housing benefit, abolition of the Family Premium and Date of Claim Regulations. It's not expected to be pushed to a vote.\nThursday\nThe Commons meets at 9.30am for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions; then mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the Public Accounts Commission and Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission. After the weekly Commons Business statement from the Leader of the House, the rest of the day is devoted to debates chosen by the Backbench Business Committee.\nFirst is a select committee statement from Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the committee's report The collapse of Kids Company: lessons for charity trustees, professional firms, the Charity Commission, and Whitehall.\nThen comes debates on Parliamentary sovereignty and EU renegotiations and conflict in Yemen. On the first of those, the debate was applied for by the Conservative John Baron who believes the prime minister has not made a restoration of UK Parliamentary sovereignty a priority in his EU renegotiation.\n\"Without the restoration of sovereignty, everything else is peripheral,\" Mr Baron said. \"We should by ourselves be able to stop unwanted directives, taxes and regulation. I look forward to the Government's response in the debate, given many of us have been unsuccessful in engaging with the Prime Minister.\"\nThe adjournment debate is on the Delay Repay scheme for rail commuters - led by the Lib Dem, Tom Brake.\nThe Westminster Hall debate (1.30pm) is on the role of men in preventing violence against women.\nIn the Lords, business in the Chamber begins at 11am - and the main event is the third reading of the Education and Adoption Bill - the key issue outstanding is the new regional schools commissioners created under the Bill.\nLabour peer and human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy then leads debates on both the EU Committee's report Subsidiarity Assessment: Reform of the electoral law of the EU and on a reasoned opinion on the European Parliament's proposed decision on the election of MEPs. The final business in the Chamber is a debate on the EU Committee's report on Capital Markets Union: a welcome start.\nFriday\nIt's another private members' bill day in the Commons (from 9.30am) opening with detailed consideration of the Conservative Mike Wood's Riot Compensation Bill, and then William Wragg's Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill.\nIf those are completed (and there seems to be a consistent pattern of padding out these report stage debates)  there might be a little time left to allow a mini-second reading debate on Peter Bone's Ovarian Cancer (Information) Bill, but I doubt Christopher Chope's Bat Habitats Regulation Bill will be reached.\nOne other Friday trend to watch out for is for the granting of urgent questions, which used to be quite a rarity on Fridays, when the Commons tends to be thinly-attended.\nThe Speaker's Office always insists that these are decided on merit, but I can't help wondering if some kind of message is being sent, about the increasing tendency to slip policy announcements out on a Thursday, when they might not be noticed by departing MPs.", "Katie Parke was diagnosed with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis as a toddler. It means deposits build up in the lungs making it hard to breathe.\nA 3D printed windpipe was used by doctors to practice delicate surgery before an operation to clean her lungs.\nSharon Parke said

her lungs cleaned.\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis requires regular washing of the lungs with saltwater to remove the deposits.\nAccording to research by the team, there are only three children worldwide that have the disease.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Ms Parke explained how her daughter was first diagnosed.\n\"When Katie was three and a half she took severe pneumonia and they couldn't get her off the oxygen so they sent her for further investigation up at the Royal.\n\"They diagnosed that her and at the time the signs weren't good for Katie because she was in such poor health.\"\nShe said surgeons had ever worked on someone so young or so small.\n\"They found it very hard to get the right tubing's and pipes to fit Katie's throat,\" Ms Parke said.\n\"To put Katie under anaesthetic, there's always a risk she won't pull through.\n\"They were able to make a trachea perfectly proportioned to Katie's, which meant prior to operations, they were able to work with different tubing to fit her trachea and that saved a lot of time in surgery.\"\nDuring Katie's operation, one of her lungs needed to be ventilated while the other was cleaned.\nThe technology meant that Katie spent less time under anaesthetic and being ventilated.\nShirley McKenna, the principal of Glendermott Primary School in Derry, said Katie was an inspiration.\n\"For her grit, her determination in how she's faced the challenges in life, she's an absolute credit to us as a school and her family.\n\"She's an amazing wee girl.\"", "Police said the four men, aged 20, 31, 40 and 42,

there were reports of alleged assaults on Rangers players.\nA number of Rangers fans also came on to the pitch and clashed with rival fans.\nThe pitch invasion delayed the presentation of the trophy and there was no lap of honour for Hibs players.\nRangers players were not able to pick up their cup final medals.", "Osama Krayem, a 23-year-old Swedish national, was arrested in Brussels earlier this month.\nThe Belgian judge responsible for the Paris attacks investigation has charged him with terrorist murder and participating in a terrorist group.\nHe is suspected of buying the suitcases used to carry the Brussels bombs.\nOsama Krayem was also caught on CCTV with metro bomber Khalid el-Bakraoui shortly before he blew himself up.\nHe is already facing terrorism charges in relation to the Brussels attacks.\nThe Belgian federal prosecutor said that Osama Krayem was picked up in Ulm in southern Germany by a hire car rented by key Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam and had travelled to Belgium.\n\"The investigation showed that [Krayem] could be placed in different safe houses used by the terrorist group,\" the prosecutor said, including a location in Schaerbeek.\nOsama Krayem grew up in Malmo in south-west Sweden.\nA relative said her nephew \"just disappeared\" and later phoned his family to say that he had left to join the so-called Islamic State.\nHis lawyer told reporters last week that Osama Krayem was co-operating with authorities.\nIn the Brussels attacks in March, three suicide bombers killed 32 people at Zaventem airport and the Maelbeek metro station.\nThe attacks took place just days after the arrest in Brussels of Salah Abdeslam, who had been on the run for four months.\nThe Paris attacks of 13 November killed 130 people.", "Councillors representing the New Forest National Park Authority voted in favour of instigating the Cycle Charter.\nThere are 30 clauses containing guidance for people organising cycling events in the New Forest.\nThe cap on the number of cyclists in large events has been called \"discriminatory\" by CTC, the national cycling charity.\nNew Forest National Park Authority chairman Oliver Crosthwaite-Eyre said: \"The vast majority of cycle events are under this threshold and have been operating without any complaint for many years.\n\"The figure of 1,000 has been well received by parish councils.\n\"We hope that all event organisers will follow the charter's criteria even if they don't agree with it all.\"\nThe charter will be sent to all cycle event organisers, the authority said.\nThe Safety Advisory Group for the forest will work with event organisers and review each event on a \"case-by-case\" basis.\nSam Jones, campaigns co-ordinator for CTC, said: \"The cap in cycling numbers was loosely justified on safety grounds.\n\"It is therefore mystifying and incredibly frustrating that our amendment, which placed the Safety Advisory Group at the very heart of decision-making for each

second-round game on Wednesday.\nThornton didn't have a shot at a double in the opening six legs of the match as his poor scoring allied to Gurney's superb 105 average allowed the Northern Irishman to storm into a two sets lead.\nGurney won the first leg of set three after Thornton, 49, missed five shots at a double but a 180 helped the Scot open his account in the next and he went on to clinch the set thanks to 12 and 13-dart legs as his form suddenly improved.\nThornton's average exceeded 105 in sets four and five as his run of nine out of 12 legs helped move him 3-2 ahead, as Gurney's form dipped considerable.\nHowever after Thornton won the opening leg in set six, his failure to set up a routine double top shot in the next as he instead had to aim for double 18, which he missed, granted Gurney a reprieve.\nGurney then produced his 161 out shot to move 2-1 ahead in the set before winning the next to ensure the decider.\nThornton missed shots at double top and double 10 in the opening leg of the final set and as the Scot's game became increasingly ragged amid a couple of unlucky bounce-outs, Gurney held his nerve to win the next two legs.\nA relieved Gurney told Sky Sports that his victory was \"a monkey off my back\".\n\"I've had seven or eight world championships (both PDC and BDO) and I've never got past the second round,\" added the 30-year-old.\n\"I knew he was

But many others organisations, such as the UN, put the figure as high as 80-94% - the size of the country's informal sector makes an accurate figure hard to gauge.\nZimbabwe is a country of \"enormous disparities between a very wealthy few and the impoverished mass, with a squeezed middle,\" says Sue Onslow, of the Africa international affairs programme at the London School of Economics.\n\"The economy's doing much better than it was in 2008-2009, but it's started to falter.\n\"The lack of a stable policy environment has been a cause for concern for the international business community that wants to put substantial investment into the country.\"\nBut the government's room for manoeuvre seems to be limited.\nMr Kanyenze says: \"Even before the election, 70% of the budget was going on employment costs, so very little was remaining for service delivery or rehabilitating the infrastructure, which implies that all those issues which are critical for growing the economy - dealing with power outages, water shortages, the decay of infrastructure, the cost of capital and dealing with the out-datedness of technology... those issues are not going to be dealt with.\n\"We are in a survivalist mode at the moment, with very little in the state coffers at the moment.\"", "The Family Sharing initiative will let a user of the Steam service share their library of games across up to 10 other devices.\nOther people will be able to play the titles, store their own saved games and earn their own in-game achievements.\nValve said a small scale trial of the sharing system would start in mid-September.\nSteam is one of the most popular platforms used by PC gamers to buy and access video games bought over the internet.\nValve uses it to promote its own titles as well as games written by third-party developers, from whom it takes a cut of the sales.\nBy introducing the sharing facility Valve may make its service appear more attractive than that of rivals such as Gog, Desura and Electronic Art's Origin.\nHowever, it could also impact sales if people who would otherwise have bought their own copy now decide to share someone else's.\nTo address this risk Valve will prevent more than one person being able to play the same purchase of a title at the same time.\nIndustry watchers say that if the move proves popular other online marketplaces may follow.\nIn an explanation, posted to the Steam website, Valve said free sharing would be enabled when someone authorises a computer to access their games.\nOther Steam members can request authorisation if they see that a friend or other family member owns a game they want to play.\nIf the owner of a game wants to play it while someone else is already using it, the person borrowing that game will be given a few minutes to either buy the game for themselves or have to quit.\nSharing will give people access to almost any game stored in a Steam account not just those titles made by Valve.\nHowever, Valve said not all games would be eligible for sharing because \"technical limitations\" - which might include separate subscriptions - might stop some being made available.\nValve spokeswoman Anna Sweet said the sharing service was launched in a direct response to user requests.\nValve is well known for video games such as Half Life, Left 4 Dead and Portal, but millions of gamers use its Steam service to buy and manage their library of games.\nSteam began as a way for people to manage games on PCs but Valve has been working to expand its reach.\nSteam has a Big Picture mode that makes it easier for games to be played on big screens.\nIn addition, it is known to be working on a Steam box, a console that gives people access to their account and lets them play games on a TV.\nRob Crossley, writing on the CVG games news site, said family sharing was \"likely to now be a key feature of the long-awaited Steam box\".\nAlso, he pointed out, the sharing idea was very similar to one Microsoft floated for its forthcoming Xbox One console.\nThe idea has now been withdrawn but Microsoft has hinted that it might return.", "The posters, designed to highlight a drop in the price of a four-pint bottle of milk, displayed pictures of a type of cattle used exclusively for meat.\nBut people with a beef have taken to the social-networking site Twitter to criticise the supermarket.\nA spokesman for Tesco said the adverts were being replaced.\nThe mistake was first spotted by farmers, who pointed out that the cows on show were a Hereford cross cow -

Ties have slowly been warming but it is clearly the successful conclusion of the nuclear accord with Iran that has paved the way for the embassy reopening.\nA number of other European countries have already sent ministers and trade delegations hotfoot to Tehran in the wake of the nuclear deal. Britain has to an extent lagged behind.\nThe hope though is that better diplomatic ties and stronger economic links might help to bolster more reform-minded elements in the Iranian leadership and open up Iranian society to new pressures for change.\nIn 2013, the UK and Iran both confirmed the appointment of non-resident charges d'affaires to act as heads of diplomatic affairs.\nThe reopening of the embassy was first publicly proposed by William Hague in June last year, but it has been held up by technical problems.\nIran's reluctance to relax import laws has slowed the replacement of communications and other equipment taken out when the post was abandoned.\nThe Home Office has also sought assurances over visa regulations amid fears that it would otherwise be unable to deal with

Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) welcomed the vote.\nFisheries Secretary Richard Lochhead also praised the move.\nBertie Armstrong, chief executive of the SFF, said: \"The current CFP is widely acknowledged as being badly over-centralised and failing to deliver effective fisheries management.\n\"We therefore welcome today's vote in the European Parliament, which is another step on the way to

year.\"\nHe explained: \"In particular, we welcome the support for the decentralisation of fisheries management.\n\"Rather than a centralised 'one size fits all' policy, we now have a real opportunity to control our fisheries much more effectively on a regional basis where fishermen, government, scientists and other relevant stakeholders can develop effective management regimes.\n\"As far as discards are concerned, no-one hates discarding more than our fishermen but there is concern about how a discards ban would work in practice, given the complex mixed fisheries that our fishing fleet works in.\n\"There is still, therefore, much to discuss on the operational details of how such a plan would actually work.\"\nMr Lochhead said: \"Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was badly needed

basis for discussions with the Ministers in the coming weeks.\n\"I am looking forward to continuing to fight Scotland's corner at the fishing council in Europe later this month, especially in terms of ending micromanagement by Brussels of our seas.\n\"I am determined that we must not squander this once-in-a-generation opportunity to secure the reform that our fishing communities need if we are to ensure that both our marine environment and fishing industry can survive and thrive.\"\nMEP Struan Stevenson said: \"These reforms will wrestle control away from the micro-managers in Brussels who have made such an absolute mess of fisheries policy for the past 30 years.\n\"The vote today in Strasbourg was a seminal and long-overdue landmark on the road to reform of the CFP.\"\nHelen McLachlan, fisheries programme manager at WWF-UK said: \"This is a ground-breaking result for the future of fisheries across Europe and beyond.\n\"This vote reflects the views of the hundreds of thousands of

But on the stroke of tea, a delivery from Nathan Lyon turned out of the rough and rattled into Cook's off stump.\nEngland's post-tea capitulation began when Lyth went after Siddle's second ball and skied a catch to mid-on.\nThe Yorkshire opener has only scored 105 runs in eight innings and will surely need a big score in the second innings to have any chance of retaining his place this winter.\nIan Bell and Joe Root both fell to good deliveries but it was not long before England's batsmen were bringing about their own demise.\nBairstow took Mitchell Johnson's bait as he pulled a short ball to deep square leg, and after Jos Buttler had been bowled through the gate by Lyon, Stokes thrashed at a Marsh lifter and gifted a simple catch to a backtracking Peter Nevill.\nStuart Broad then edged his fourth ball to slip to leave England's innings in tatters.\nEngland's dismal batting display actually followed a much-improved bowling performance in which they removed Australia's last seven wickets for 194 runs.\nThe biggest obstacle was Smith, whose 11th Test century underlined why he has been chosen to succeed Clarke as Australia captain following the Ashes.\nIn this series so far, Smith has embodied Australia's fluctuating fortunes. He made an imperious 215 in the victory at Lord's, but contributed four single-figure scores as Australia surrendered the Ashes in the successive three-day defeats at Edgbaston and Trent Bridge.\nHere he was back to his belligerent best, cutting and pulling regular boundaries against an England attack struggling to find consistent lines.\nHe added 146 with Adam Voges and 91 with Mitchell Starc, who scored an entertaining 58 at number nine to help Australia rally from 376-7 after two quick wickets from Moeen Ali before lunch.\nMoeen, Stokes and Finn all captured three wickets - with the latter collecting his 100th Test scalp when he dismissed Marsh.\nWith Australia seemingly set for a lead of more than 350 and rain forecast for Sunday, Clarke may consider changing the habit of a lifetime by enforcing the follow-on and raising the prospect of a three-day win.

The animal is worshipped and decorated during festivals; holy men take around cows, with their foreheads smeared in vermillion, to seek alms.\nThere is even a journal called Indian Cow; and a Love 4 Cow Trust to \"propagate and promote love\" for cows. A right-wing Hindu organisation has actually launched cosmetics using cow urine and dung.\nThe cud-chewing, sedentary bovine also provides fodder for humour. A hugely popular - and possibly apocryphal - story relates to an essay on the animal by a civil service aspirant. \"The cow is a successful animal,\" it began. \"Also he is quadruped, and because he is female, he give milk, but will do so when he is got child. He is same like God, sacred to Hindus and useful to man. But he has got four legs together. Two are forward and two are afterwards.\"\nBut let's not digress.\nMore seriously, most states forbid cow slaughter, and the ban on beef has been criticised by many because the meat is cheaper than chicken and fish and is a staple for the poorer Muslim, tribal and dalit (formerly untouchable) communities.\nNot surprisingly, the cow is also India's most polarising - and political - animal.\nLast month, a 50-year-old man in northern Uttar Pradesh was killed in a mob lynching over rumours that his family had been storing and consuming beef at home. Even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke his silence over the killing nearly two weeks later, members of his party thrashed an independent lawmaker in Kashmir for hosting a beef party.\nEarlier this month, Hindus and Muslims clashed over rumours, again, of cow slaughter in Uttar Pradesh. A row over banning beef is threatening to stoke religious tensions in restive Kashmir.\nWhile campaigning for his party in the crucial state elections in Bihar state, Mr Modi ridiculed a regional rival for saying many Hindus eat beef.\nThere are worrying reports that supporters of the BJP and right-wing Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh in the state have launched a virulent campaign against cow slaughter and beef.\nAlthough the government's own animal census shows that the cow and buffalo population has grown - a 6.75% increase between 2007 and 2012 -  and cow slaughter is banned in most states, there is hysteria being whipped up that the bovine is under threat.\nVigilante cow protection groups have mushroomed. They claim to have a strong network of informers and say they \"feel empowered\" because of the ruling Hindu nationalist BJP government in Delhi. One of these groups actually managed to get a court order against a beef and pork festival at a Delhi university in 2012.\nThat's not all. The BJP-ruled state of Rajasthan has a cow minister. There are campaigns going on demanding that the cow should replace the tiger as the national animal - a minister in Haryana, also ruled by the BJP, promptly began an online poll.\nMr Modi must partly share the blame for whipping up the unfounded and perilous frenzy over cow slaughter. On the general election campaign trail last year, he accused the Congress government of promoting a \"pink revolution\" - slaughtering cows and exporting meat for money. \"Should we feel proud of this endeavour of the UPA government led by Congress, which is founded on the killing of our mother cow?\" he wrote in a blog in 2012. It's another matter that under Mr Modi, India continues to be the world's largest exporter of beef - 80% of it buffalo meat.\nBut historian Mukul Kesavan sees one argument offered for cow protection as \"just a belligerent assertion\".\n\"It goes like this: I am a Hindu, the cow is my mother, and I won't have her killed. What's being invoked here isn't morality or sentimentality or chivalry or economics: this is an assertion of fictive kinship that effectively argues that all cows are Hindu women.\"\nThis is not the first time the cow has become mixed up with politics.\nThe first organised Hindu cow protection movement was launched by a Sikh sect in Punjab in about 1870. In 1882, Hindu religious leader Dayananda Saraswati founded the first cow protection committee. \"It made the animal a symbol of the unity of a wide-ranging people, challenged the Muslim practice of its slaughter and provoked a series of serious communal riots in the 1880s and 1890s,\" says historian DN Jha.\nConflicts over cow slaughter often sparked religious riots that led to the killing of more than 100 people in 1893 alone. In 1966, at least eight people died in riots outside the parliament in Delhi while demanding a national ban on cow slaughter. And in 1979, Acharya Vinoba Bhave, considered by many as a spiritual heir of Mahatma Gandhi, went on a hunger strike to ban cow slaughter.\nThe \"holiness of the cow\" is also a myth, argues Dr Jha. In his masterly work The Myth of the Holy Cow, Dr Jha cites religious scriptures and ancient texts to show that Hindus did consume beef in ancient India. This flew against the Hindu right-wing assertion that beef-eating arrived in India with the coming of Islam. (Not surprisingly, he was threatened after the book was published in India.)\nAnd American academic Wendy Doniger correctly argues that Hindus \"do not always treat cows with respect or kindness; cows are sometimes beaten and frequently half starved\".\nIndia's most revered leader Mahatma Gandhi may also have been responsible for the Hindu veneration of the cow. He once said that the \"central fact of Hinduism is cow protection\", and spoke about the \"idea of penance and self-sacrifice for the martyred innocence\" it embodied. Today, in an ironical twist, the Hindu radicals seem to have hijacked the cow, and all it stands for.", "Captain Jeff Davis, a spokesman, said 10 operatives were killed in a single strike on 3 February.\nA second strike on 4 February killed Abu Hani al-Masri, who had close ties to the late al-Qaeda leader, he said.\nAl-Masri is said to have set up and run al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan during the 1980s and 1990s.\nHe also had close ties to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who became the leader of al-Qaeda when Bin Laden was killed by US forces in 2011.\n\"These strikes disrupt al-Qaeda's ability to plot and direct external attacks targeting the US and our interests worldwide,\" said Capt Davis.\nAl-Qaeda's influence in Syria operates largely through an affiliate jihadist group, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.\nThe group announced in mid-2016 that it was no longer affiliated with any external group, prompting  speculation that it had cut ties with al-Qaeda, although the latter group was not mentioned by name.\nIt is thought that the leadership structure of Fateh al-Sham is still intertwined with al-Qaeda.\nA US operation against al-Qaeda in Yemen last week - the first military action authorised by new president Donald Trump - resulted in the death of a Navy Seal and up to 16 civilians, including children, according to reports.\nMr Trump's administration declared the operation a success, saying it had yielded valuable intelligence.", "The Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 57.3 from 54.2 in March, well above economists' expectations.\nA reading above 50 indicates growth.\nMarkit said the sector enjoyed \"solid improvement\" last month, with new orders being received at the fastest rate since January 2014.\nThe survey found the main source of new work came from the domestic market, but there was a \"solid increase in new export business\" due to a combination of better global economic conditions and the weakening of the pound.\nThe fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June has made UK goods cheaper for foreign buyers, but has also pushed up the cost of imports for UK companies.\nMarkit said price pressures faced by manufacturers remained \"elevated\", but noted that input cost inflation had \"eased significantly\" since January.\n\"Although only accounting for 10% of the economy, the upturn in the manufacturing sector represents some welcome good news after the sharp slowing in GDP seen in the first quarter,\" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at INS Markit.\n\"The big question is whether this growth spurt can be maintained, especially given the backdrop of ongoing market volatility and a number of political headwinds such as elections at home and abroad.\n\"Other surges seen since the middle of last year have generally proved short-lived, as weak wage growth sapped consumer spending.\"\nOfficial figures from the Office for National Statistics last week indicated that the UK economy grew by just 0.3% in the first three months of the year, the slowest rate since the first quarter of 2016.", "He extended the offer in a phone call on Friday with the Palestinian Authority president, their first contact since Mr Trump took office.\nMr Trump hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in February.\nAt that meeting, Mr Trump dropped a long-standing US commitment to a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\nA \"two-state solution\" to the decades-old conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is the declared goal of their leaders and the international community.\nIt is shorthand for a final settlement that would see the creation of an independent state of Palestine within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, living peacefully alongside Israel.\nThe UN, the Arab League, the European Union, Russia and, until now, the US routinely restate their commitment to the concept.\nThe policy shift fuelled Palestinian concerns that Washington was becoming even more pro-Israeli under the Trump administration.\nThere have been no substantive peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians since US-mediated negotiations broke down in April 2014.\nMr Trump's spokesman, Sean Spicer, confirmed on Friday that the US president had invited Mr Abbas to the White House \"very soon\".\nThe president told the Palestinian leader they would discuss how to rekindle peace talks, Abbas spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.\nHe said Mr Trump had stressed \"his commitment to a peace process that will lead to a real peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis\".\nPalestinian officials had indicated before Friday's call that Mr Abbas would press the US president about Israeli settlement-building on occupied land and the importance of a two-state solution.\nDuring last month's joint press conference, Mr Trump asked Mr Netanyahu to \"hold back on settlements for a little bit\", appearing to catch the Israeli leader unawares.\nThe US Senate on Thursday approved Mr Trump's controversial nominee for ambassador to Israel.\nDavid Friedman favours relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem, a highly inflammatory proposal because both Israel and the Palestinians lay claim to the city as their capital.\nThe US Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, met the Palestinian envoy to the UN, Riyad Mansour, for the first time on Tuesday.\nShe tweeted afterwards that the Palestinians should \"meet with Israel in direct negotiations rather than looking to the UN to deliver results\".", "There is a heated debate now about the police tactics, as some 6,000 Hamburg residents clean up after the riots.\nSome in Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrat (CDU) party say Hamburg Mayor Olaf Scholz should quit.\nLeft-wing extremists of the so-called Black Bloc are under intense scrutiny.\nGermany has had previous experience in tackling the violent protesters who try to disrupt international summits.\nThe Hamburg authorities deployed about 20,000 police to keep protesters away from the G20 venue.\nMr Scholz and his Social Democrat (SPD) allies argue that the police did their main job effectively - protecting the G20.\nBut a minority of anti-G20 protesters - more or less affiliated to the Black Bloc - engaged in running battles with police in the streets.\nViolence was predictable after the leftist militants invited in sympathisers from across Europe with the slogan \"Welcome to Hell\".\nThe flashpoint was an authorised demonstration by about 12,000 people on Thursday evening. Violence erupted when police tried to isolate Black Bloc militants who refused to remove their masks, defying the law.\nPolice had earlier banned an overnight protest camp in the city - yet the right to peaceful assembly is enshrined in German law.\nCornered by police, the violent minority, numbering about 1,000 and clad in black, hurled bottles and chunks of paving stone. Some protesters scaled a wall and rained fireworks down on the police.\nOfficers in full riot gear retaliated with baton charges, tear gas and water cannon.

It also provoked doubts about its legality. Given the potential international ramifications, it's highly unlikely British police will storm into the ground-floor mission.\nBut neither is it likely that Britain or Sweden will give the guarantees that Ecuador and Mr Assange want - that he won't face onward extradition to the US.\nSo for now the stalemate continues.  Police are posted at both the front and back of the Ecuadorean embassy to ensure Julian Assange doesn't escape - and Britain is faced with a costly security operation.\nThe US is carrying out an investigation into Wikileaks, which has published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables, embarrassing several governments and international businesses.\nAlleged Wikileaks source Bradley Manning, 24, an intelligence analyst in the American army who served in Iraq, is alleged to have leaked US government cables to the whistle-blowing website. He is set to face a court martial.\nIn an interview for US television in 2010, Mr Assange denied any knowledge of Pte Manning.\nMr Assange began his speech by thanking his supporters, many of whom have been holding a vigil outside the building in Knightsbridge.\nSpeaking of the visit by police officers to the embassy on Wednesday, Mr Assange said: \"Inside this embassy after dark, I could hear teams of police swarming up into the building through its internal fire escape. But I knew there would be witnesses and that is because of you.\n\"If the UK did not throw away the Vienna Conventions the other night it is because the world was watching and the world was watching because you were watching.\"\nIt is an established international convention that local police and security forces are not permitted to enter an embassy, unless they have the express permission of the ambassador.\nThe Foreign Office has said it remained committed to reaching a \"negotiated solution\" but following its obligations under the Extradition Act, it would arrest Mr Assange if he left the embassy.\nIn 2010, two female Wikileaks supporters accused Mr Assange, an Australian citizen, of committing sexual offences against them while he was in Stockholm to give a lecture.\nMr Assange claims the sex was consensual and the allegations are politically motivated.\nIn a statement issued after the Ecuadorean decision to grant Mr Assange political asylum, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the UK was under a \"binding obligation\" to extradite him to Sweden.\nMr Assange entered the embassy after the UK's Supreme Court dismissed his bid to reopen his appeal against extradition and gave him a two-week grace period before extradition proceedings could start.\nEcuador's president Rafael Correa has suggested Mr Assange could co-operate with Sweden if assurances are given that there would be no extradition to a third country.\nMr Assange's balcony appearance occurred as foreign ministers from the Union of South American Nations were gathering in Ecuador's second city, Guayaquil, to discuss the diplomatic situation caused by the asylum decision.\nShortly before Mr Assange delivered his speech, his legal adviser Baltasar Garzon said the Australian had told lawyers to carry out \"a legal action\" protecting \"the rights of Wikileaks [and] Julian himself\".\nMr Garzon, a former judge, did not give specific details of the action but said it would also extend to \"all those currently being investigated\".\nBarrister and former government lawyer, Carl Gardner, said Mr Assange's options were now severely limited.\n\"There's no legal action he can take now. All he can do is make these public calls for people to do things he would like them to do and play a waiting game with the British authorities.\n\"The British government is likely to think that time is on their side. It's Julian Assange who is stuck in this embassy. It's the Ecuadoreans who have the problem of him on their hands and perhaps one of them is likely to tire of the situation before Britain.\"", "Westbury-on-Trym Councillor Geoff Gollop has been nominated as the chosen candidate following a vote by party members at a private meeting.\nMr Gollop is a former lord mayor of the city - a ceremonial post which does not carry direct power, unlike the role of elected mayor.\nHe said: \"I'm very positive about the campaign ahead\".\nHe added: \"Bristolians want people who can speak up for the city and I believe I can do that.\"\nMr Gollop said he was aware that the role of elected mayor is different to that of lord mayor.\nHe said: \"Lord mayor is a wonderful ceremonial role, but the elected mayor is the one who actually has ultimate responsibility for running the city and delivering its services, and there's a need for absolute change in the way we do things.\n\"This is a wonderful opportunity for the city, and I hope we grab it with both hands.\"\nMr Gollop said the three key areas he would focus on if he was elected are transport, education and inequality.\nThe Labour Party has previously announced Marvin Rees as its candidate, the Lib Dems named Jon Rogers and the Green Party has chosen Daniella Radice.\nBristolians voted in favour of replacing the council leader with an elected mayor in a referendum in May.", "Anyone who is anyone has been there - even us - done it and moved on to the next thing: the #TrumpIsComing Challenge.\nDonald Trump's election victory had barely been confirmed than the new craze was born.\nVideos posted under variations on the phrase - currently the most popular is #TrumpsComingChallenge - show students going about daily life until someone shouts \"Trump's coming.\" The two most common reactions seem to be to run screaming or collapse on the floor.\nEmi Chavez, from Azle, Texas, claims he started it with his post just hours after the election result and challenged people to \"show me how you'd react if you saw Trump\".\n\"Me and my friends are Mexican but we were born here and everyone is scared by what Trump said about sending Mexicans back home and all the other racist things, as well,\" says Chavez, aged 16.\n\"The whole idea was to have some fun, but Trump is a very scary guy to kids of our age because we don't want our families to get split up,\" he adds.\n\"So we were just thinking about how we would just run away from him if he came near.\"\nThe video struck a chord and has inspired lots of others to make their own version, including Rudy Reyna, who posted his on his Twitter account @rudygarzareyna.\nThe 17-year-old from Austin, Texas, says he is not a fan of Mr Trump's but made his video just for the fun of it.\n\"I first spotted it on Twitter when I was scrolling on my feed and I thought it was a funny video to make so one day during school I rounded up friends and did the challenge,\" he says.\nStudents at a college in South Carolina took a slightly different approach, producing a mash-up of the #AndysComing and #TrumpIsComing challenges.\nThe #AndysComing challenge is based on the film Toy Story, where the toys drop to the floor when their owner Andy comes into the room.\nThe video shows students dancing and when someone shouts \"Trump's coming\", they all fall to the ground motionless.\nIt was made by Yung Astroo, from Columbia, South Carolina, and posted on a number of social media platforms, including his instagram account.\n\"Me and my team saw people doing the 'AndysComing' challenge on the internet but we decided we'd put a twist on it. so we danced to some music and then yelled 'Trump is coming' and then everyone fell out,\" he says.\nThe Mannequin Challenge has swept social media in recent months with Michelle Obama and Beyonce among those posing perfectly still in mid-action for the camera.\nEven Hillary Clinton and her team posed as mannequins on election day with the message \"Don't stand still.

The curator of its museum, Adam Chadwick, said: \"Was Bodyline unsportsmanlike? By the standards of the day, yes. By the standards of now, it was a stroke of genius.\"\nAt the beginning of the 1930s, the MCC - Marylebone Cricket Club - still ruled the cricketing world from its seat at Lord's in London.\nBut it had a problem, in the shape of batting phenomenon Don Bradman.\nDuring their 1930 tour of England, Australia - the arch rivals - had dominated the home bowlers, with Bradman averaging a staggering 139.14.\nThe MCC looked to austere amateur player Douglas Jardine for an answer, making him England captain.\nJardine believed Bradman struggled against balls which bounced into his chest and formed a tactic to exploit this. But the plan needed the right bowler, and that bowler was former Nottinghamshire miner Harold Larwood.\nDuncan Hamilton, Larwood's biographer, said: \"He had two things. Firstly he was incredibly accurate, he claimed never to have bowled a wide in his career, and accuracy was essential to Bodyline.\n\"Secondly he was devastatingly fast. All his contemporaries said he was the quickest they had faced. At certain times during that series he must have got close to, if not passed, the 100mph (160km/h) mark.\n\"Every fast bowler who sees that old footage says, 'Wow, that's quick!'.\"\nJardine's plan was to use what was known in England as leg theory. Bowling fast, high-bouncing deliveries on the line of the leg stump of the wicket - where a batsman would usually stand.\nThe batsman had three choices: to move but risk exposing his wicket, to play the ball with his bat and face being caught by a ring of close fielders, or try to duck and risk painful blows.\nThe tour began in earnest at Sydney in December 1932, ironically without Bradman playing. Bodyline brought England victory.\nBy Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent\nBodyline introduced a previously unspoken element into Test cricket - namely the physical intimidation of the batsman.\nThe placement of fielders, deliberately positioned to catch the ball from batsmen protecting themselves from short, fast deliveries aimed at the ribs and throat, was entirely legal at the time, but seriously threatened the code of sportsmanship that is so central to cricket.\nThat said, the Australian administrators - who made such a meal of Jardine's tactic at the time - were noticeably quiet when their own fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson were terrifying batsmen with short-pitched bowling in the 1970s.\nThe authorities acted swiftly after the Bodyline tour to limit the placing of fielders in catching positions on the leg side in an attempt to deter a repeat of the tactic, and also brought in a restriction of the number of bouncers that can be bowled in a single over.\nBut after Lillee and Thomson, the West Indies' formidable pace attack of the late 1970s and 80s also proved that skilful, intimidatory fast bowling is every bit as effective as Bodyline, even with field restrictions and after the introduction of helmets.\nComplaints about the tactic quickly appeared. As the bruises and wickets mounted, the disquiet turned to anger, with claims batsmen were being physically targeted.\nDespite Australia levelling the series at the second match in Melbourne, the repeated blows to lightly protected players attracted outraged headlines.\nSome batsmen endured hours of punishment and even Bradman looked unsettled.\nMr Studham said: \"The tactics employed by Jardine roused intense passions, as they were so out of accord with anything that had previously happened on the cricket field.\n\"Targeting the bowling along the line of the batsman's body was regarded by the Australian crowds as vicious, unsporting and especially after repeatedly battering the batsmen, 'hitting a man when he was down and certainly no part of cricket'.\"\nWith everything to play for, and feelings running at fever pitch, the Adelaide match opened in front of packed stands.\nCricket bible Wisden would later call it \"probably the most unpleasant Test ever played\".\nAustralian captain Bill Woodfull was left staggering after being struck just above the heart by Larwood.\nThe booing lasted for three minutes, despite the fact England had not yet deployed Bodyline tactics in the match.\nThat would change though, moments later, when Jardine called out to Larwood: \"Well bowled Harold,\" and set the fielders in the hated Bodyline formation. Police had to be deployed on the boundary.\nThe next day, Oldfield had his skull cracked and Larwood had to be escorted from the ground.\nSource: BBC Religion & Ethics\nIs fair play important in sport?\nThe line between gamesmanship and cheating\nCan cricket teach children fair play?\nIt was almost inevitable the problems would overflow from the playing field. But no-one could have predicted it would lead to three events then unthinkable in cricket.\nMCC tour manager Pelham Warner, seeking to smooth relationships, was sent packing by the normally placid Woodfull with what were, for some years, the 25 most famous words in sport.\n\"I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not.\"\nThe comment, made in the previously sacrosanct dressing room, was then leaked to the press.\nThe next day, Australian Board of Control for International Cricket sent a cable to the MCC which described England's tactics as \"unsportsmanlike\", the ultimate taboo for guardians of the game.\nMr Chadwick said: \"The MCC reacted with incredulity to the Australian messages that the tactics were unsportsmanlike and they felt it was really out of the question that an MCC team led by a gentleman of Douglas Jardine's character could possibly behave in such a manner.\n\"The archives really do show the feeling was 'Oh, the Australians are being a bit hysterical about it'.\"\nBut the situation spiralled. Jardine threatened to withdraw his team from the remaining two matches unless the allegation was retracted.\nStoked by newspaper reports, each country backed its own players.\nThe standoff only ended when Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons told the cricket board a British boycott of Australian goods could cripple the country.\nEngland won the series 4-1. Bradman's batting average was cut to a merely excellent 56. But the shock lasted for years.\nMr Studham said he felt Bodyline was one of those sporting \"rite of passage\" stories all Australian children learn about.\n\"The on-field tactics and resulting carnage at the third Test in Adelaide split already strained relations between the teams, the game's governing authorities, and even threatened to split the governments.\n\"While perfectly legal at the time, it left lasting ill-feeling in Australia where it was seen to be outside the spirit of the game.\n\"The fact that a few years later the laws of cricket were amended to ban Bodyline bowling contributed greatly to its continuing national disdain.\"\nMr Chadwick said: \"The MCC did not have any advance warning of the tactics which Jardine was using and wasn't really aware of the impact - all they were getting was newspaper reports and telegraph messages of the score.\n\"When they saw it for themselves they realised this really wasn't the sort of cricket they had always set themselves up to promote as containing the best values of Britishness and gentlemanly fair play.\"\nJardine retired from first class cricket the following year. Larwood's agony was more extended.\nInjured through over-bowling, he was then stunned at his treatment by cricket's hierarchy.\nMr Hamilton said: \"He was totally betrayed by the establishment. They treated him like toxic waste.\n\"He was asked to apologise and he rightly refused, saying he had done what his captain had asked. He got no support for his injury.\n\"On his return to Nottingham he was met by cheering crowds 10,000-strong. He went from that to being vilified. The whole thing was a tragedy.\"\nLarwood never played for England again. On the advice of some of his old Bodyline foes, he emigrated to Australia in 1950 - becoming firm friends with Bert Oldfield.\nHe was appointed MBE in 1993, at the age of 88.

The number of over-65s has increased by 85,000 (11%) since 2001, and now represents some 17% of the total population.\nThere were 230,000 people aged 80 and over in 2011, an increase of 19% on the figure of 193,000 in 2001.\nIn contrast, there has been a decrease of 69,000 (11%) in the number of children aged between five and 14 over the past decade.\nHowever, in 2011 there were 293,000 children aged under five, an increase of 6% from 2001.\nOver the past century, the age profile of the population has become much older, with the proportion aged under 15 falling from 32% in 1911 to 16% last year, while the proportion aged 65 and over has increased from 5% to 17%.\nThe Scottish population had been falling steadily from a peak of 5,227,000 in the mid-1970s to 5,055,000 in 2002, but has been rising since.\nThe total Scottish population was just over half a million higher in 2011 than it was 100 years earlier.\nThere are also huge differences in population density across the country, with the population per square kilometre ranging from nine in Eilean Siar (the Western Isles) and the Highlands to 3,395 in Glasgow.\nCommenting on the results, Acting Registrar General Audrey Robertson said: \"These first results from the Census confirm the upward trend in the size of Scotland's population in recent years.\n\"At 5,295,000, the population is now the highest ever recorded. This increase is partly because there have been more births than deaths, but mainly because more people have moved to Scotland than have left.\"\nCulture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the figures represented a \"historic moment for our country\".\nShe said: \"A decade and more of devolution has delivered a growing and record high population. That is not simply a sign of the dynamic, attractive nation we are building. It is also a key factor in delivering economic growth in future years.\"\nShe said the figures showed that the Scottish government was on track to meet its population growth target.\n\"Scotland has a large, established migrant community and we welcome the contribution new Scots are making to our economy and society,\" she added.\n\"Scotland still faces challenges. In common with almost every mature economy, we have an ageing population, but these figures also show that the under-fives population is up by 6% compared with 2001.\"", "While polls show that Mr Trump's position has the support of many party faithful, it could be general election poison. A recent survey, for instance, has Mr Trump faring poorly against Democrat Hillary Clinton compared to his Republican rivals. And yet, according to another poll, the candidate has opened a massive lead over his competition.\nSo as Republican candidates gather in Las Vegas on Tuesday for the party's last presidential debate of 2015, they're faced with an overriding question. What's the best way to beat the brash billionaire before it's too late?\nHere are five possible strategies.\nIt may be hard to remember, but it was once thought that best way to defeat Mr Trump was  to pretend he wasn't there. In the first Republican debate, back in August, candidates like former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker effectively screwed their eyes shut and plugged their ears whenever he spoke.\nThe result was that Mr Trump ploughed through them, making the candidates seem weak and irrelevant. Mr Walker's campaign is now a historical footnote, and Mr Bush is languishing in single digits.\nSome Republican presidential hopefuls may continue to talk over, under and around Mr Trump, but they do so at their peril.\nLike a mythical beast of old, The Donald has been the undoing of many candidates who have sought to test their mettle against the front-runner.\nTexas Governor Rick Perry? Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal? They charged headfirst into the Trump buzzsaw and are now licking their wounds at home. Ohio Governor John Kasich made a run at the real-estate mogul during the last debate and was cut to ribbons.\nGiven the level of outrage that Mr Trump's Muslim border ban generated last week, however, some candidates may figure the time is ripe for another frontal assault.\nA \"have you no decency\" style soliloquy could be just the trick for candidates like Mr Bush, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie or Florida Senator Marco Rubio, looking to rally the anti-Trump forces to their banner.\nOr it could end in disaster, as Mr Trump once again gives better than he gets.\nIf Mr Trump is a classic bully, as his detractors often say, what better way to defeat him than with humourous derision? Take away a bully's ability to intimidate and demean, and he loses his power.\nIt's a lesson that Mr Kasich's team has perhaps learned. After the candidate's ill-fated debate fireworks and a television advertising campaign questioning Mr Trump's fitness to lead, a super-PAC supporting the Ohio governor is now running a 75-second video that ridicules the New Yorker as a failed steak huckster.\nWhen Mr Trump called Ted Cruz a maniac this weekend, the Texas senator responded by tweeting a video of a song by the same name from the 1980s film Flashdance.\nNeedling like this could prompt an angry response from Mr Trump, of course. But when the New Yorker hits back against attacks, he looks strong. If he punches back against humour, he could look small and thin-skinned.\nA much-anticipated poll released on Sunday showed that Mr Cruz has vaulted ahead of Mr Trump as the top preference of likely Republican participants in Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucus. The Texan has done so by deliberately avoiding any conflict with Mr Trump, direct or otherwise.\nMr Cruz was surreptitiously recorded explaining his strategy during a closed-door meeting with deep-pocketed donors in New York last week. He said he planned to \"bear hug\" Trump and fellow outsider Ben Carson and \"smother them with love\", then collect their supporters when they eventually begin looking for a more serious, electable candidate.\nMr Cruz will likely stay the course on Tuesday night, and other candidates, seeing his success, may follow his lead - or even direct their fire at the new hot hand.\nMr Carson already is on the record saying he'll stand with Mr Trump if the Republican establishment tries an end run around the nomination rules to block one of them from winning.\nPerhaps the way Mr Trump loses is for other candidates to act just like him.\nThen again, that sounds a lot like a way Mr Trump wins.", "Spelthorne Borough Council said using the cameras could deter aggressive acts, or verbal and physical abuse.\nThe plan is to have a more \"imposing\" recording system to address high levels of anti-social behaviour, the council said.\nUnder the plans, the technology will also be given to parking officers.\nAnd in the future, cameras could also be worn by officers from other departments.\nThe council said cameras would be able to capture images close up, record audio, allow an officer to have their hands free while recording an incident, and provide evidence for dealing with investigations.\nCameras would also help with investigating claims of inappropriate conduct by officers, the council added.\nConsultation on the move runs until 9 July.", "The Local Government Association wants councils to be given control of careers advice to ensure teenagers \"pursue the right course for them\".\nA report for the LGA suggests the teenage dropout rate costs the country \u00c2\u00a3814m a year.\nThe government said its reforms were ensuring teenagers gained vital skills.\nThe LGA commissioned the Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion to analyse the latest figures which were for the year 2012-13.\nThe researchers combined dropout and failure figures on A-levels, apprenticeships and further education courses to give a total of 178,000 16 to 18-year-olds not completing their courses.\nOf these, 92,000 students withdrew from schools, primarily from AS and A-levels; 24,200 did not complete apprenticeships or training courses and an estimated 61,900 withdrew from FE courses.\nThe teenagers at greatest risk of dropping out were apprentices, with a quarter not finishing, suggest the figures.\nThe authors note success rates both for AS and A-levels and FE courses have improved in recent years, with 16% of students dropping out of further education, 9% from individual AS-levels and 5% from individual A-levels.\nThis has contributed to a long-term fall in the total number of drop-outs, of 30% since 2006-7, they add.\nDespite this they calculate 12% of all government spending on post-16 education and skills goes on \"uncompleted\" courses.\n\"For the young person it means coping with uncertainty and a sense of failure and with hard decisions about what to do next.\n\"For schools, the exchequer and the taxpayer there is the cost of providing education that does not result in a positive outcome.\"\nThe LGA says the current centralised approach to post-16 education does not allow schools and colleges to help teenagers find the right courses.\n\"Local councils, colleges, schools and employers know how to best help their young people and should have devolved funding and powers to work together to give young people the best chance of building careers  and taking jobs that exist locally,\" said Cllr David Simmonds, chairman of the LGA's children and young people board.\nThe Association of Colleges said the reasons for young people not finishing their courses were \"complex\".\n\"Sometimes they get a job and therefore leave education,\" said AoC chief executive Martin Doel, but he agreed poor careers advice was a problem.\n\"This report shines a light on failing careers advice in this country.\n\"We would like to see the establishment of careers hubs in every local area supported by schools, colleges, universities, local councils, employers and Jobcentre Plus to ensure everyone has access to the high-quality impartial advice they deserve.\"\nThe government said its new independent careers and enterprise company would boost collaboration between schools and employers and give young people access to high quality advice and opportunities.\n\"We are reforming academic qualifications and vocational education to ensure young people get the knowledge and skills that they need to move into a job, apprenticeship or to continue their education,\" said a Department for Education spokesman.\nThe spokesman said the government had ring-fenced \u00c2\u00a37.2bn to ensure an education or training place for all under-18s, adding that the number of young people not in education, employment or training was at its lowest recorded level.", "1908 - King Carlos and eldest son assassinated in Lisbon.

An official investigator has said there is no evidence she burned the Koran.\nThere have been mixed reactions among the Afghan public following the court's decision.\nSome have welcomed it and say Farkhunda's family have finally been given justice.\nHowever, the Afghan judicial system is widely seen as corrupt and many others have criticised the court's proceedings.\nKangaroo courts are common across the country, especially in areas where the government does not have full control and where tribal elders and local strongmen act as a self-appointed judiciary.\nEven in the cities where people can resort to the courts, cases can face long delays and corruption is chronic. The police force is more focused on fighting an insurgency than upholding the rule of law.\nThe trial today may provide some justice for Farkhunda but it does not reflect the reality of efforts to counter crime and violence across Afghanistan.\nViolence against women, and violence in general, are common in a country that has been at war for over three decades.\nBut even against that backdrop, the attack on Farkhunda on 19 March shocked many Afghans, taking place as it did in the heart of the capital and under the eyes of the police.\nFarkhunda was beaten to death before her body was driven over by a car, dragged through the streets and then set on fire.\nSome of the attackers recorded the brutal killing on their cell phones and footage was later uploaded to social media sites, including some that appeared to show a policeman taking part in the attack and pushing Farkhunda onto a roof.\nCorrespondents say that had it not been for the videos and the nature of the incident, it would have gone unnoticed like hundreds of similar cases, especially in rural areas, many of which never make it to court at all.\nThe case is not the first where the justice system has rapidly handed down death sentences for a high-profile crime - in October five men were hanged for a gang rape in Paghman district.\nIn that case, as in the current trial, there were concerns from rights activists over the speed and fairness of the convictions.", "The 21-year-old has been at Chelsea since she was nine and spent last season on loan with Women's Super League 2 side Bristol City.\n\"I know a few of the girls already from playing with England and I have met a few of them as well.

Party leader Nigel Farage has backed the Grassroots Out effort, which failed to get designation as the official Leave campaign but is continuing to operate.\nLeaders of Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru, Carwyn Jones and Leanne Wood, are prominent Welsh Remain campaigners, as is former Welsh Liberal Democrat leader and sole Lib Dem AM Kirsty Williams.\nUKIP group leader Neil Hamilton and UKIP Wales leader Nathan Gill will be vocal campaigners on the Leave side, and Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies has said he will be backing Leave as well.\nThe big messages from the different campaigns are the same in London as they are in Cardiff. But three big flashpoints are the focus of many of the specific Welsh arguments over the EU.\nThe future of the steel industry and the EU's role in it has proved highly controversial, driven by massive job losses and a decision by Tata Steel - owner of the Port Talbot steelworks - to sell its business.\nLeave campaigners say governments in the UK have been limited by what they can do because of EU rules restricting state aid, and have been unable to set tariffs to protect Welsh and UK business from cheap Chinese steel.\nThose on the Remain side argue the EU already has a large number of anti-dumping measures in place, and the UK government is able to act on energy prices and business rates to cut costs for the steel industry. There is more on the steel debate here.\nAnother big point of contention has been the structural funds Wales receives - cash given to poorer parts of the union to help boost economic growth.\nUnder the current EU scheme, Wales is pegged to receive \u00c2\u00a31.8bn from 2014 to 2020.\nMost of it is spent in the west Wales and valleys region, which covers the whole of Wales excluding Powys, Monmouthshire, Newport, the Vale of Glamorgan, Flintshire, Wrexham and Cardiff.\nBack in February, Prime Minister David Cameron said the UK government could not guarantee making up any shortfall in the EU aid Wales receives if Britain was to leave the bloc.\nBut UK government employment minister Priti Patel has countered that, saying the funds may end anyway after 2020 even if there was no Brexit.\nMeanwhile Wales' share of the pot of money spent by the EU on farming has also been subject to debate.\nUnder the current Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) scheme for 2014-2020, Wales receives around \u00c2\u00a3200m a year.\nFirst Minister Carwyn Jones has warned farming in Wales would \"come effectively to an end\" with the loss of EU subsidies.\nBut Leave campaigners argue agriculture would be better off out of the EU, saying CAP is extremely bureaucratic, and levels of government support to British farming would be unaffected and could actually rise in the event of Brexit.\nBritish or Irish citizens aged 18 or over and who are living in the UK are eligible to take part in the referendum.\nCommonwealth citizens who are permitted to live in the UK can also take part, as can British citizens who live overseas but have been registered to vote in the UK for the last 15 years.\nUnless you arrange for a postal or proxy vote, you will need to go to a polling station.

It's a new lease of life - I've been given confidence by both coaches to express myself.\n\"It's given me a new motivation, and I feel I'm being challenged and tested every day.\"\nFollowing England's exit at the group stage of the World Cup, Youngs was one of a handful of senior players under pressure for his international place.\nAnd he admits he had to prove his worth to Jones.\n\"To start with he was probably testing me out a little bit,\" said Youngs, who has 57 England caps and toured with the British and Irish Lions in 2013.\n\"But I feel like I've got a very good relationship with Eddie. He instils a huge amount of belief both within the squad and individually, and I really enjoy being coached by him.\"\nYoungs featured in all of England's Six Nations matches, and although he was dropped to the bench for the decider against France in Paris - with Danny Care starting in his place - his impact in the second half was telling.\n\"When [Jones] told me [I wasn't starting], he said I was going to come off the bench and win us the Grand Slam. I thought 'I quite like the sound of that!'\" Youngs said.\n\"At that point I said to Eddie it's just about winning the Grand Slam.\n\"Of course I want to start every game, but so does Danny, so that naturally isn't going to happen. I was just happy that I could come on and really help the team. The plan paid off, so credit to him.\"\nMeanwhile, Youngs says his decision to recently sign a new contract at the Tigers has been vindicated.\n\"Definitely,\" he added. \"I really think whatever happens this year, I feel like we are only just touching the surface under Mauge.

Three mothers also died.\nStaff shortages, medicines given in error and treatment delays were also among the incidents logged.\nThe Scottish government pointed out that in 2015 the country had recorded its lowest level of stillbirths.\nHealth Secretary Shona Robison also said that there were fewer neonatal deaths and fewer maternal deaths.\nThe minister's comments came following a BBC Scotland Freedom of Information (FOI) request into the number of \"adverse events\" taking place in maternity units.\nAcross Scotland from the beginning of 2011 until the end of 2015 there were more than 285,000 births, including 1,247 stillbirths.\nHealth board detailed minor incidents including slips, trips, bumps and falls, but also more serious events including:\nIn reality the total figure may be far higher than 25,000, because some health boards - including Greater Glasgow and Clyde - provided only the most serious events rather than all adverse events.\nThe figures did reveal almost 500 incidents in relation to staff shortages, more than 440 referring to medicine given in error, and more than 100 delays in treatment.\nThe FOIs also showed evidence of a series of staffing problems at health boards in Fife, Grampian, Highland and Lanarkshire.\nIt has raised questions over how many of these adverse events could have been avoided.\nOn Monday, the Scottish government announced an independent investigation into baby deaths at a Kilmarnock hospital.\nMs Robison said Healthcare Improvement Scotland would review care at Crosshouse after BBC Scotland revealed six so-called \"unnecessary\" deaths of babies at the hospital since 2008.\nFraser Morton said NHS Ayrshire and Arran health board had refused to carry out a review following the death of his son Lucas in Crosshouse Hospital last year.\nHe believed a shortage of staff and a lack of training contributed to the death of his son.\nGillian Smith, the director of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM), said there was a definite correlation between staff shortages and adverse events.\nWith new figures showing that more than 40% of Scotland's midwives were in their 50s and 60s, she warned that the country was facing a \"demographic timebomb\".\nShe added: \"There are always going to be adverse events of some kind... mothers and babies will still die for reasons we don't know and couldn't avoid.\n\"However, what we want is to look at all the avoidable incidents and take the learning we can from that.\n\"Learning from avoidable incidents in the only way we will get better.\"\nMs Robison told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that she had full confidence in Healthcare Improvements Scotland to carry out the national review of maternity services, which will report in a few weeks' time.\nShe added: \"Its remit will be to look into the questions being asked by families to make sure that the processes and procedures that should have been followed within Ayrshire and Arran were followed and to report to me after looking into all of those issues.\"\nShe acknowledged that she was ultimately accountable if future failures in the system were not addressed.\nShe said: \"Accountability lies both with the board and ultimately the chief executive of that board and eventually, yes, with me. Which is why that we need to make sure that all of these adverse events are subject to review, that lessons are learned. \"\nA project by the Royal College of Gynaecologists (RCOG) aims to halve the number of \"avoidable\" stillbirths in the UK by 2020.\nIts Each Baby Counts programme found 1,000 incidents of avoidable harm at birth in its first year of monitoring - with about 100 of them in Scotland.\nProf Alan Cameron, the principal investigator on the UK wide project, said: \"Some of these events don't cause any harm but they are recordable as adverse events. But some can cause harm and what is key is that the service sits up to recognise that and do something about it.\n\"Some of the events we have looked at are staggering. Some of the reports we have read beggar belief.\n\"Labour is the most hazardous journey a baby makes. If something goes wrong health service staff have to act quickly. That can be alarming. This is such an acute and unpredictable specialty.\"\nHe said BBC Scotland's findings showed that health boards had different classifications for serious adverse events, and he called for consistency.\nHe added: \"It is a concern that some areas are not doing as well as others in terms of outcomes from labour.\n\"I would certainly hope another Morecambe Bay would not happen again and that is why we need to put mechanisms in place to prevent it happening in future.\"\nFiling Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to Scottish authorities is nearly always an exercise in frustration. If they are not late they are incomplete, if they don't give you what you ask for they don't give it to you at all.\nMy request to the country's health boards for adverse event information hit more snags than usual. The responses issued gave a patchwork quilt of data - a frustratingly blinkered view of the actual figures. The ensuing inconsistent mishmash of data ultimately boiled down to how boards had interpreted what I meant by \"adverse event\".\nSome only returned data on \"serious\" adverse events - those incidents that resulted in actual loss of life. Others returned events classified as \"minor\", \"major\" or \"significant\" - they included anything from falls and staff shortages, to a pregnant woman involved in a \"radiation incident\".\nThe waters were muddied further by some overly enthusiastic redaction of internal adverse events reports, partial returns with some data missing, and some responses citing only annual totals without giving us an idea of the type of adverse event.\nBut even as a partial snapshot these figures are rather alarming. These varying returns mean we don't know exactly how many adverse events occurred, determined how they have been dealt with (to ensure that they could be avoided in future), and nor can we say with 100% certainty whether the number of adverse events in our hospitals is falling.", "A judge ruled Ashers Baking Company discriminated by refusing to make a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan.\nMelissa and Aaron Klein, who run Sweet Cakes in Oregon, were fined $135,000 (\u00c2\u00a387,000) in April for refusing to make a wedding cake for a lesbian couple.\nThey have now closed their shop and sell cakes from their home.\nMrs Klein said it had been a difficult few years for her family but they were going to appeal and \"fight it as far as they can\".\nMr Klein said he did not regret what had happened and believes he made the right decision by refusing to serve the couple.\n\"I believe in the Bible and I believe the Bible is God's inherent word.

A post mortem examination indicated she had been manually strangled.\nWhen police arrived, the court heard that Arustamovs told them he had strangled his mother and made a gesture suggesting such with his hands. He also spoke about his mental health.\nAfter being arrested, the defendant made a full admission that he had killed his mother.\nWhen asked if he and his mother argued, he said \"all the time\".\nHe also said that while he did take drugs, he did not have any on the evening in question as he had no money.\nArustamovs told police: \"I took her by the throat and my heart starting beating so so fast I thought it was going to jump out of my chest.\"\nDespite the confession, Arustamovs told police he did not mean to kill his mother and, at one stage, said: \"I don't know what came over me... I couldn't even kill a cockroach.\"\nHe told police that when he had finished, he covered his mother with a blanket, placed her hands on her chest and said \"forgive me\".\nHe then put on classical music, took four Tempazepam and packed a bag before calling 999.\nProsecutors said Arustamovs was a long-term substance abuser who had a history of \"serious mental illness\" and had experienced neglect and abuse in his childhood.\nArustamovs defence lawyers said the situation was \"tragic\" and that: \"From a very early age this young man was the subject of an extremely chaotic lifestyle.\"", "The bank also lowered its estimate for the UK's economic growth in the third quarter of this year from 0.7% down to 0.6%.\nFor the second month, Ian McCafferty was the only one of its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members to vote for an increase in rates.\nPolicy makers also said that the risks from the slowing Chinese economy had increased since August.\nIn its summary, the committee said: \"Developments since then have increased the risks to prospects in China, as well as to other emerging economies.\"\nIt added:  \"Global developments do not as yet appear sufficient to alter materially the central outlook described in the August Report, but the greater downside risks to the global environment merit close monitoring for any impact on domestic economic activity.\"\nIt said that the reason for reducing its UK growth forecast had been the latest run of poor manufacturing and industrial production figures.\nDespite this, the MPC remained optimistic about the UK economy.\nIt said: \"Domestic momentum is being underpinned by robust real income growth, supportive credit conditions, and elevated business and consumer confidence.\n\"The rate of unemployment has fallen by over two percentage points since the middle of 2013, although that decline has levelled off more recently.\"\nBritish business was divided as to whether the Bank should be putting up interest rates. James Sproule, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: \"This far into the recovery, it is worrying that interest rates are still at an extraordinary low.\n\"The ability to cut rates and stimulate the economy in times of instability is crucial, but with rates at their historic level of 0.5%, this is almost impossible.\"\nBut David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: \"Although earnings are edging up gradually, labour costs are not rising at a pace that should cause concern in the near future. Inflation is also likely to remain below the 2% official target until well into 2017.\n\"When major international organisations such as the World Bank and the IMF have warned against putting up interest rates, it would be premature and risky for the UK to consider such a step.\"\nThe bank said Mr McCafferty alone of the nine-strong MPC had wanted to increase the main interest rate by 0.25%.\nIt said he believed that costs were likely to go up in the UK and lead to inflation overshooting the bank's target.\nThe bank said that interest rate rises, when they did come, would be slow.\n\"All members agree that, given the likely persistence of the headwinds weighing on the economy, when Bank Rate does begin to rise, it is expected to do so more gradually and to a lower level than in recent cycles,\" the statement said.\n\"This guidance is an expectation, not a promise.\"\nHowever, while most economists earlier in the year had expected a rise in rates before 2016, opinion seems to be shifting.\nHoward Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said: \"An interest rate hike sometime in the first half of 2016 looks a pretty sure bet, but it currently seems a very close call as to whether the Bank of England moves around February, or holds fire until the second quarter.\n\"Thereafter, we expect interest rates to rise gradually to 1.25% by the end of 2016, 2% by the end of 2017 and 2.5% by the end of 2018.\"", "The ring was bought for \u00a310 at a car boot sale at West Middlesex Hospital in Isleworth, west London, in the 1980s.\nIt's expected to fetch \u00a3350,000 at Sotheby's - and it's not the first item to turn small change into a small fortune...\nAfter paying \u00a310 for a floral vase at a car boot sale, the Hampshire-based owner decided to sell it on eBay.\nWhen bids soared to \u00a310,000, he withdrew it - and sought professional help in identifying just what he'd bought.\nThe \u00a310 pot was, in fact, a rare enamel \"two quails\" vase, thought to have been made at Beijing's Imperial Palace at least 220 years ago.\nJohn Axford, Asian art expert at Woolley & Wallis auctioneers, confirmed the \"excellent investment\" bore the four-character mark of Qianlong - the sixth emperor of the Qing dynasty - and would have been made in the palace workshop between 1736 and 1795.\nThe firm sold the vase in Salisbury in November 2016, where it made \u00a361,000, including buyer's premium.

That is what people in Scotland expect, and to what I am committed.\"\nThe Scottish government said its analysis suggested that more than 500,000 jobs in the UK were supported by exports to Scotland from the rest of the UK.\nEconomy Secretary Keith Brown said: \"Analysis also shows Scotland is the rest of the UK's second largest export market, behind only the US, with exports worth over \u00a350bn.\n\"It is quite simply nonsense to suggest that the rest of the UK would cease trading with Scottish firms if we were inside the single market but outside the UK.\n\"As we have consistently made clear, Scotland does not face a choice between exporting to the EU or the UK - we can, and should, do both.\n\"This is why we will continue to pursue a way forward which retains our place in Europe's single market which is vital to protect economic stability, jobs and inward investment.\"", "Klopp, 49, was appointed in October 2015, and led the Reds to eighth in the Premier League, as well as the finals of the League Cup and Europa League.\nThe German wants to replicate the success of Liverpool \"grandfathers\" such as Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley.\n\"Sometimes you can use the experience of other people,\" he told the BBC.\n\"I don't live in the past but there is a reason why we are here - because of our fathers and grandfathers.

Members of Britain First and the English Defence League congregated on Victoria Embankment for what they described as a \"march against terrorism\". Paul Golding, the leader of Britain First, began by reciting the Lord's Prayer.\nThe attempt to categorise acts of terror as representative of the Islamic faith has gained much less traction here in the United Kingdom than it has in the United States, where it became one of Donald Trump's signature themes throughout his presidential campaign. He repeatedly castigated former President Barack Obama for his refusal to use the phrase \"radical Islamic terrorism\".\nBut President Obama, from the outset of his presidency, sought to calm tensions with Islam. His first overseas visit in 2009 was to Cairo University, where he offered a fresh hand of friendship.\n\"I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world,\" he explained, \"one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition.\n\"Instead, they overlap, and share common principles - principles of justice and progress, tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.\"\nThis Wednesday, both the Protestant and Roman Catholic Churches in Britain will continue to press the case for engagement, as opposed to antagonism.\nAt 12:00 BST, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend what is billed as a Service of Hope at Westminster Abbey, which will bring together representatives of all those who were touched by the events of 22 March.

And his willingness to welcome our British imams is a further sign that he regards interfaith dialogue as being of the utmost importance.\"\nTo further emphasise this commitment, it has just been announced that Pope Francis will travel to Egypt later this month. In a statement, the Vatican said the Pope had accepted an invitation from President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Roman Catholic bishops, the leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria and the grand imam of Cairo's Al-Azhar mosque.\nNone of these meetings is intended to deny the profound theological differences that exist between these faiths, especially where it concerns the uniqueness and divinity of Christ.\nBut by continuing the dialogue, these faith leaders are sending a clear message to the communities they serve: that faith without works is dead and that dialogue must always trump conflict.", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nWill Grigg poked in Stephen Warnock's low cross to put the Latics in front just before half-time.\nAnd Warnock was once again the provider as he cut the ball back for Yanic Wildschut to fire in a low finish.\nEric Lichaj's late penalty for Forest was saved by Jakob Haugaard after Lica had been fouled in the area.\nAn FA Cup classic had looked unlikely, with both sides in miserable form, and it is Forest who have now gone seven games without a win in all competitions.\nThe visitors made few chances and saw little of the ball - and they have now lost six of their past seven matches.\nWigan - inside the Championship relegation zone in 23rd place - had been on an equally disappointing run, but they were superior to a side who sit three places above them in their division.\nThe Latics recovered from the early blow of losing Nick Powell to injury and could have added to their tally if Michael Jacobs and Jordi Gomez had done better with good chances.\nWigan boss Warren Joyce: \"Whether it's the cup or the league, it's just nice to win games.\n\"I was pleased with the performance and I thought we thoroughly deserved to win.\n\"I would have been very disappointed had we let them back in - and it was sloppy play that resulted in the penalty.\"\nNottingham Forest boss Philippe Montanier: \"It was a poor game.

Other than that, questions were being asked about whether the coup attempt had shaken Mr Nkurunziza's resolve to pursue his controversial third-term bid.\nBut instead of addressing these burning issues, Mr Nkurunziza chose to announce to the media that his country was facing a terror threat from al-Shabab.\nThe group itself was surprised  - its spokesperson said Mr Nkurunziza's remarks were \"dumb-founding\".\nA number of Ugandans I talked to about Mr Nkurunziza's remarks drew parallels with what happened in their own country in 2006 when parliament, on the instigation of President Yoweri Museveni, amended the constitution and lifted the two-term limit on the presidency.\nAnd all indications are that he is now set to run for fifth term.\nUntil then, Mr Museveni had been credited for bringing peace and stability to his country.\nIn fact, the Clinton administration described him as part of a \"new breed\" of African leaders.\nBut like Mr Nkurunziza, Mr Museveni's decision to lift the two-term limit on the presidency came at a great cost to his image - both locally and internationally.\nFormer US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Johnnie Carson said at the time that \"many observers see Museveni's efforts to amend the constitution as a re-run of a common problem that afflicts many African leaders - an unwillingness to follow constitutional norms and give up power\".\nSeveral donors including the UK, Ireland, Norway, and Sweden cancelled millions of dollars of aid to Uganda, saying not enough had been done to return the country to democratic multiparty rule.\nMr Museveni surprised many by unilaterally deploying Ugandan troops to Somalia to prop up the transitional federal government, which was battling Islamist insurgents who later metamorphosed into al-Shabab.\nMany analysts saw Mr Museveni's move as an attempt to win back the Western support he had lost on account of his decision to scrap presidential term limits.\nThe US had for a long time wanted to see Somalia pacified to prevent it from becoming a terror breeding ground for al-Qaeda.\nThrough his military excursion into Somalia, Mr Museveni effectively played what has variously been referred to as the \"anti-terror\" card to make himself indispensable to the West - especially the US and the UK.\nUganda's government maintains that the decision to go into Somalia was done in order to prevent the conflict from spilling over into neighbouring countries, as well as to show that African countries can solve African problems.\nAfter the embarrassing 1993 \"Black Hawk Down\" incident, the US preferred to advance its objectives through proxies, and it is easy to see why Washington found it difficult to resist a strategic anti-terror alliance with Mr Museveni, who had already put Ugandan boots on Somalia's blood-thirsty ground.\nCriticisms of Mr Museveni's \"unwillingness to follow constitutional norms and give up power\" not only faded into irrelevance, he was now referred to by the same US government as a \"strong ally in the fight against terror\".\nSeveral African countries, including Kenya and Burundi, have since joined the \"war on terror\" under the African Union mission in Somalia.\nTherefore, on paper, Mr Nkurunziza may have genuine concerns about a possible terror threat to his country.  However, the curious timing of his remarks about a possible terror threat is suspicious - especially when one juxtaposes it against Mr Museveni's 2006 \"military charm offensive\" to win back Western support after he came in for severe criticism for scrapping presidential term limits.\nIs Burundi's President Nkurunziza using the al-Shabab threat to deflect attention from his domestic political woes?\nThis is the question on the lips of many socio-political commentators and analysts - and the jury is still out.", "Two shareholders are taking the bank to court, claiming it has failed to properly disclose investment risks associated with the environmental problem.\nCommonwealth Bank denies the claim.\nThe case is believed to be the first attempt globally to force financial institutions to tell shareholders how exposed they are to climate risks.\nIt comes as Commonwealth Bank faces a separate court action over its alleged breaches of Australia's anti-money laundering laws.\nEnvironmental Justice Australia (EJA) has filed a motion on behalf of two shareholders in the Federal Court of Australia, claiming climate change poses \"material or major risks\" to the financial position of both the bank and its customers.\nIn Australia, the risks include more severe droughts and cyclones as well as a rise in sea levels.\n\"Because it has exposures throughout the economy there are potentially some very serious financial exposures for the bank,\" said David Barnden, a lawyer for EJA.\nThe legal service says the bank ought to have known about those risks, and failed to disclose them in its 2016 annual report.\nThey are not seeking any monetary compensation.\nEJA says the case is only an attempt to force Commonwealth Bank to publish relevant information, so that investors can make better decisions.\nThe court action also called on Commonwealth Bank to detail its involvement in the Adani Carmichael project, which is worth A$16bn (\u00c2\u00a310bn;

Around 270,000 of these birds are found on Santa Cruz island.\nThe finches are threatened by a nest fly which lays parasitic larvae in their nests which attack the young, usually at night.\n\"They are maggots basically, is what they are,\" said Prof Dale Clayton from the University of Utah, the senior author on the study.\n\"Some of the eggs are laid in the nostrils of the nestlings so those eggs hatch and the larvae begin feeding immediately in the nostrils so you see perforations through the bill in especially bad cases.\n\"They are pretty nasty customers.\"\nThe flies are believed to have arrived in the Galapagos in the 1960s.\nProf Clayton and his colleagues developed a mathematical model using five years of data to project the impact of fly damage on the reproduction rates.\nFinches breed more successfully in years when relatively high rainfall increases the food supply. They tend to do badly during extremely wet or dry years.\nIn two of the three scenarios that they modelled, the finch populations were declining and at risk of extinction. In the worst scenario the birds would be gone in 50 years.\nThe model showed that the critical elements in their survival were the probability that a given nest was infested by flies and to a lesser extent the proportion of adult finches that survive from one year to the next.\nBut the model also contains some good news according to the paper's first author,  Dr Jennifer Koop, who carried out the research as a doctoral student and now is an assistant professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\n\"Even though these guys may be going locally extinct, the model also shows that if you can reduce the probability of infestation, then you significantly alleviate the risk of extinction,\" she said.\nThe researchers argue that if the number of infected nests could be reduced by 40% then the risk of extinction would essentially be lifted.\nThere are a number of human interventions that could achieve this, they say, including the introduction of wasps that would lay their eggs in the fly larvae which would destroy them.\nAnother idea is to use pesticides. Cotton balls would be treated with the chemicals and left for the birds to incorporate into their nests.\n\"The birds will travel up to 60 feet or so and pull the cotton out and line their nests,\" said Prof Clayton,\n\"If they get at least a gram of that fumigated cotton in their nests, you kill 100% of the flies.\"\nThe scientists say that the stress from the flies might also provoke an evolutionary response in the finches. They point to a related species where the nestlings learned to become more vocal when attacked by the pest, as a result the parents fed them more and their survival rates improved.\nResearchers are concerned that these threatened finches may simply not have enough time to adapt.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc.", "Georgina Jones, 92, from Dolwyddelan, has been awarded the BEM.\n\"Receiving the honour was a shock and a surprise when I had the letter,\" she told BBC Wales.\n\"I've been in the church all my life, playing in three or four services on Sundays.

And among women we didn't expect being overweight to be more of a risk factor than alcohol.\"\nIn total, 14 lifestyle and environmental factors, such as where you live and the job you do, combine to cause 134,000 cancers in the UK each year.\nAbout 100,000 (34%) of the cancers are linked to smoking, diet, alcohol and excess weight.\nOne in 25 of cancers is linked to a person's job, such as being exposed to chemicals or asbestos.\nSome risk factors are well established, such as smoking's link with lung cancer.\nBut others are less recognised.\nFor example, for breast cancer, nearly a 10th of the risk comes from being overweight or obese, far outweighing the impact of whether or not the woman breastfeeds or drinks alcohol.\nAnd for oesophageal or gullet cancer, half of the risk comes from eating too little fruit and veg, while only a fifth of the risk is from alcohol, the report shows.\nFor stomach cancer, a fifth of the risk comes from having too much salt in the diet, data suggests.\nSome cancers, like mouth and throat cancer, are caused almost entirely by lifestyle choices.\nBut others, like gall bladder cancer, are largely unrelated to lifestyle.\nThe researchers base their calculations on predicted numbers of cases for 18 different types of cancer in 2010, using UK incidence figures for the 15-year period from 1993 to 2007.\nIn men, 6.1% (9,600) of cancer cases were linked to a lack of fruit and vegetables, 4.9% (7,800) to occupation, 4.6% (7,300) to alcohol, 4.1% (6,500) to overweight and obesity and 3.5% (5,500) to excessive sun exposure and sunbeds.\nIn women, 6.9% (10,800) were linked to overweight and obesity, 3.7% (5,800) to infections such as HPV (which causes most cases of cervical cancer), 3.6% (5,600) to excessive sun exposure and sunbeds, 3.4% (5,300) to lack of fruit and vegetables and 3.3% (5,100) to alcohol.\nDr Rachel Thompson, of the World Cancer Research Fund, said the report added to the \"now overwhelmingly strong evidence that our cancer risk is affected by our lifestyles\".\nDr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said leading a healthy lifestyle did not guarantee a person would not get cancer but the study showed \"we can significantly stack the odds in our favour\".\n\"If there are things we can do to reduce our risk of cancer we should do as much as we possibly can,\" he said.\nGlyn Berwick, of Penny Brohn Cancer Care, which specialises in offering nutrition and exercise advice, agreed.\n\"We know from years of experience the positive impact that changing lifetsyles can have.\"\nThe president of the Royal College of Physicians, Sir Richard Thompson, said the findings were a wake-up call to the government to take stronger action on public health.\n\"The rising incidence of preventable cancers shows that the 'carrot' approach of voluntary agreements with industry is not enough to prompt healthy behaviours, and needs to be replaced by the 'stick' approach of legislative solutions,\" he said\nThe government said it was intending to begin a consultation on plain packaging by the end of this year.\nDiane Abbott, Shadow Public Health Minister, said: \"The government is failing on all the main public health issues.\n\"And the message from Labour, the Tory-led Public Health Committee, campaigners like Jamie Oliver and even some the government's own policy panels is clear: the government's approach to tackling lifestyle-related health problems is completely inadequate.\"\nPublic Health Minister Anne Milton said: \"We all know that around 23,000 cases of lung cancer could be stopped each year in England if people didn't smoke.\n\"By making small changes we can cut our risk of serious health problems -

But East Timor remained on its books as a former Portuguese colony still awaiting self-determination, and that lack of formal recognition continued to haunt Indonesian rule.\nSo can the UN now leave East Timor with its head held high? Compared to the messy outcome of many other UN interventions, East Timor is a relative success story. An impoverished, war-torn country has, in 13 years, become a fairly stable small state with promising economic growth prospects.\nHow much of that was down to the UN, and how much down to the efforts of East Timorese leaders like Jose Ramos Horta, is a matter of debate. No-one would dispute that the UN's assistance has at times been vital.\nFinn Reske-Nielsen, chief of the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (Unmit), said in a statement: \"The Timorese people and its leaders have shown courage and unswerving resolve to overcome great challenges.\n\"Although there remains much work ahead, this is an historic moment in recognising the progress already made.\"\nHe said the withdrawal did not mark an end to the partnership between the UN and East Timor, as \"challenges still remain\".\nThe UN directly administered the country until 2002 when it formally became a nation.\nBut the UN also displayed its characteristic faults in East Timor, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. Its missions were at times poorly-led, and staffed by well-paid expatriates of mixed ability; there was hubris in its declaration of success at independence in 2002, and the conflict which erupted between the young army and police in 2006 exposed flaws in UN planning.\nAn Australian-led International Stabilisation Force (ISF) was also deployed in 2006 amid violence that forced thousands of people from their homes.\nThe ISF ended its mission last month. As one of Asia's poorest nations, analysts say East Timor will rely on outside help for many years.\nOur correspondent says that the large international presence had an inevitably distorting effect on the economy of the capital Dili. Many East Timorese will be glad to see the UN go, but may also admit they have reasons to be grateful, he adds.", "It was the ultimate example of what looks increasingly like a regional insurrection in defiance of majority opinion, and no little advice, from the nation's capital.\nAlmost 60% voted leave in the Midlands as a whole. In Stoke-on-Trent the figure was 10% higher even than that. So I wanted to know if Midlanders had stumbled into something they now regret.\nThe Izons Industrial Estate, near Oldbury in the Black Country, is home to a typical collection of small, predominantly metal-based, businesses.\nWhen I visited it during the campaign, I struggled to find anyone who didn't want out of the EU. So I returned to Augus Engineering, which has been run for nearly half a century by three generations of the same family.\nFar from regretting his decision to vote leave, the boss Steve Cartwright told me there was growing confidence in the area.\nThe lower pound was making their exports more competitive; the prospect of an eventual fall in interest rates was helpful; and the announcement of a \u00c2\u00a360m private sector investment in a major regeneration project in Wolverhampton's city centre, far from being stalled by Brexit, had gone ahead with a media flourish exactly as planned.\n\"Certainly none of the doom and gloom that had been predicted,\" he told me.\nOn closer examination, I find our region has something of a north-south divide. Among our more affluent areas, Cheltenham, The Cotswolds and Warwick voted to remain in the EU.\nBut they could not have saved the day, or the night, for David Cameron without big numbers in the major cities voting the same way. In the event, only Bristol did so.\nCosmopolitan Birmingham, Great Britain's biggest single electoral area, delivered arguably the greatest shock of all, finally shattering the Remainers' hopes.\nBut only by the narrowest of margins. Half a million people voted. Leave's majority was just over 2,000.\nThat's why I'm calling Birmingham the 50-50 city.\nFrom Oldbury I drove to Digbeth, just a stone's throw south of the famous Birmingham skyline where the Impact Hub houses an impressive assortment of small businesses, most of which have a clear social purpose.\nIris Bertz is a one-woman business. And an EU migrant. German born, she places about 80 young apprentices from other European countries into local firms under an EU educational programme called Erasmus Plus.\n\"If there's an end to free movement, that would be the end of projects like this,\" she tells me, warning universities, colleges and employers alike had reason to fear any restrictions to the free flow of talented people.\nThere's an old truism in politics.\nThe electorate is always right. We are told the converse is equally true. The electorate is never wrong.\nThe thing about truisms is that there is often some truth in them.\nThe West Midlands has a long history of making things work. Just as the new prime minister wants Brexit to work.\nBut maintaining the optimism that's turned Digbeth into a hotspot for business start-ups could yet turn out to be the most challenging 'work in progress' of all.", "The first case of Ebola in Monrovia was treated there and shortly afterwards infection spread through the facility - claiming the lives of 12 doctors and nurses, including the head surgeon.\nThe World Health Organization says more than 800 health workers were infected in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, the three countries most affected by the disease, with 509 of those - mainly local staff - dying.\nIt has been a major blow to countries that had very few qualified health workers in the first place.\n\"It was bad because every day you get up, you hear this person is Ebola-positive and you keep going through the motions - I touched that patient too,\" recalls Dr Nouuieh Gorpudolo, who worked closely with the surgeon who died.\nMistrust grew within the community of the nearly 500,000 people whom the hospital was serving, and, at one point, some people besieged the facility and pelted it with stones, saying it was the source of Ebola.\nThe hospital was subsequently closed, like many others across the affected countries.\nDuring the time it was shut, the facility was refurbished, but it has now reopened to the public and more people are confident of getting treatment there.\nThe changes are visible - at the entrance, a staff member wearing protective gear and a knapsack sprays the soles of the shoes of every person entering the hospital, then there is a temperature check and a hand-washing point with chlorine solution.\nThe hospital has also introduced a triage form with a checklist of Ebola symptoms.\n\"We go through the form and send a health worker to conduct an interview again... and check the temperature again,\" says Dr Gorpudolo.\nOn an average day, the hospital's lobby is full of patients waiting to be seen.\n\"Before the Ebola epidemic we used to see about 500 patients at the maternity wing a month. At the peak of the outbreak around July last year it dropped to 31 but this past month we've seen 531,\" adds Dr Gorpudolo.\nHe is among a handful of doctors serving the West African state, which has one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the world.\nIn all, the Ebola outbreak killed more than 11,000 people and on Friday, the presidents of Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are meeting donors in New York to raise funds for their countries' post-Ebola recovery.\nThe meeting was organised by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to help the three countries, who have a total combined budget of $2.1m (\u00c2\u00a31.3m), to rebuild their health systems over the next two years.\n\"Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone entered the Ebola epidemic with severely underfunded health systems,\" said Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO's regional director for Africa.\n\"After a year of handling far too many severely ill patients, the surviving staff need support, better protection, compensation, and reinforcements. The existing facilities need a complete overhaul, and many new structures need to be built. If another outbreak strikes, the toll would be far worse.\"\nEbola has exposed the need to have more health workers - not just doctors.\nLiberia's minister for health Bernice Dahn says many doctors fled the country during the civil war.\nNow, she says, the ministry's recovery plan post-Ebola prioritises increasing the health workforce.\n\"The package includes bringing in foreign medical practitioners and we're giving priority to Liberians who are willing to come back home,\" Ms Dahn adds.\nShe hopes to employ about 4,000 more health workers.\n\"Our plan is to scale up the community health workforce to be able to do health promotion and dispense (medicine) and treat minor diseases.\"\nThe WHO's representative in Liberia, Alex Gasasira, says part of the reason Ebola overwhelmed the country was because of weak health systems.\nThere was no laboratory to test samples of the virus.\n\"The specimen would have to be collected, transported to Monrovia then flown out of the country to be tested.\"\nThe local community told the BBC there were only two privately owned ambulances.\nBut following the intervention of the international community during the outbreak, many shortcomings have been rectified.\n\"We now have 45 ambulances,\" says the health minister.\nThere are also more supplies like personal protective equipment and essential drugs provided mainly by aid organisations in response to the Ebola crisis.\nBut they will not be sufficient in the long term because the organisations will wind up their operations as the outbreak ebbs.\n\"Many Liberian health workers have been trained in (testing of viral haemoragic fever samples) and laboratories have been built,\" adds Dr Gasasira.\nCompared with developed economies, Liberia, as well as Sierra Leone and Guinea, still has a long way to go to having resilient health systems that won't crumble again in the face of a large outbreak of an infectious disease.", "James Morrison's predatory strike, seizing on Steven Fletcher's flick, had seemed set to give Scotland their first Group A victory.\nBut when Bale was clipped by Shaun Maloney in the area he picked himself up to coolly convert the penalty.\nThen with three minutes remaining the Tottenham winger unleashed a brilliant 25-yard left-foot shot that curled into the top corner.\nFull qualifying tables\nIt was a dramatic ending and the result eases the pressure on Wales boss Chris Coleman but leaves his Scottish counterpart Craig Levein facing an uncertain future.\nLevein had attracted criticism after Scotland opened with two home draws against Serbia and Macedonia while Wales had started with a defeat to Belgium in Cardiff and a 6-1 thumping in Serbia.\nBut after Coleman avoided becoming the first Wales manager to lose five successive games at the start of his tenure he can now face Croatia on Tuesday with renewed heart.\nThe Scots, who had not won in Cardiff since 1983, were boosted by the return of two Fletchers to the side.\nManchester United midfielder Darren had been out for 11 months with a chronic bowel complaint but returned to captain Scotland, while striker Steven - in hot scoring form for Sunderland - was back having buried the hatchet with Levein after a two-year exile.\nThe two players were to the fore as Scotland took an early grip on the game, Darren Fletcher sitting just in front of his defence and spreading the ball wisely, while his striking namesake lurked on the shoulders of the Welsh defenders.\nA series of short free-kicks, with Gary Caldwell heavily involved, gave Wales some nervous early moments, but when they broke clear Bale flashed a volley a couple of feet above Allan McGregor's goal.\nThe Tottenham winger had started on the right and moments later Bale went even closer after being picked out by Chris Gunter's lofted pass down the flank.\nBale cut back inside Daniel Fox and unleashed a curling left-foot shot that went just wide of the far post.\nScotland's best chance of the opening quarter fell to Alan Hutton, but the full-back's speculative shot caused Lewis Price no discomfort as it sailed high over his bar.\nThe adventure from Scotland's full-backs - Hutton and Fox - did leave spaces for Wales to counter into though.\nAaron Ramsey, stripped of the Wales captaincy in favour of Ashley Williams, surged upfield before playing in Joe Allen on the left.\nThe Liverpool midfielder brought the ball on to his right foot and only a fine sliding charge from Caldwell stopped the goal-bound shot.\nBale continued to threaten and outpaced Fox to curl a cross into Morison on the back post.\nThe Norwich striker had space and time to pick his spot but sent his header back across goal past the outside of the post.\nAs several Wales players shook their heads in disbelief, McGregor thumped the ball long and high downfield where Steven Fletcher was alive to the opportunity.\nThe Sunderland striker outmuscled his marker to flick the ball into Morrison's path and the West Brom man accepted the invitation to bury the ball low past Price.\nScotland could have doubled their lead when the in-form Steven Fletcher scuffed his shot into the chest of a grateful Lewis with the goal at his mercy.\nIn a breathless last five minutes of the half, both sides should have added goals.\nFirst Allen blazed over after Bale had produced another barn-storming run down the right, then at the other end Morrison could not keep his shot down after being picked out by Hutton.\nLevein sent on Charlie Adam in midfield for Scott Brown after the break, while opposite number Coleman stayed his hand.\nDarcy Blake had been given a torrid time by Steven Fletcher in the first half, but Coleman had no other specialist centre-backs in his injury-hit squad.\nThe Wales boss was also without the suspended James Collins and will also be without Ramsey for Tuesday's trip to Croatia, after the Arsenal midfielder was booked for a clumsy lunge on Hutton.\nMorison had got little change out of Caldwell and Christophe Berra, so Barnsley's Craig Davies came on for his first Wales appearance in almost five years.\nWhile Davies added some extra muscle, Scotland continued to threaten and only a fine reaction save from Price denied Morrison his second after a deflection fell kindly.\nRamsey then wasted another gilt-edged Wales chance after racing on to Ben Davies' clearance, shooting wide when through on McGregor.\nSteven Fletcher thought he had doubled Scotland's advantage but an eagle-eyed referee's assistant ruled the ball had just gone out before the striker bundled home.\nThe brilliant Bale then earned Wales a lifeline, driving into the area before being clipped by Maloney.\nThe Spurs wide man grabbed the ball and sent McGregor the wrong way to level the scores.\nThen with time running out Bale was allowed to run at the defence and, while falling back, unleashed an unstoppable left-foot curler that sailed into the far top corner.\nFull Time   The referee signals the end of the game.\nThe ball is delivered by Gary Caldwell, Darcy Blake makes a clearance.\nA cross is delivered by Charlie Adam, Kenny Miller takes a shot.

he was to oversee the public testing of the voting system which has been vaunted by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) as key to eliminate vote rigging and to deliver a credible election.\nThe Kenya Integrated Electoral Management System (KIEMS) will be used to identify voters and transmit results.\nA similar electronic system that was used in the 2013 election failed spectacularly, leading to manual counting of votes which some have argued allowed for voter manipulation.\nMr Msando had only been on the job for two months, having taken over after his predecessor was suspended for refusing to cooperate with an audit firm which was cleaning the voters' register.\nHis death will do little to assuage growing concerns about the IEBC's election preparedness and questions about its credibility.\nOn Twitter, his name and #RIPMsando are trending, with many expressing shock and disgust at what to them looks like a targeted elimination.\nThis news also comes at a time when the government has denied allegations by opposition parties that it is planning to deploy the military to swing the election to its favour.\nWith only a week to the election, this is no doubt another testing time for Kenya and it can only emerge from this tense moment by holding credible elections and arresting and prosecuting Mr Msando's killers.\nSome fear there could be violent clashes between rival supporters after the result is announced, with the losers refusing to accept defeat.\nHowever, few expect the type of violence which killed more than 1,200 people in ethnic, post-election violence 10 years ago.\nFollowing the clashes, the International Criminal Court charged President Kenyatta and his deputy with instigating violence, but the charges have since been dropped due to a lack of evidence.\nThe government has denied ICC accusations that its witnesses had been intimidated to prevent them from testifying.", "The 20-year-old joined Chelsea in 2013 and made his senior debut last season, scoring four goals in 16 games.\nHe is the first Burkina Faso international to score in the Premier League after his two goals last season.\nTraore, who had a previous loan spell with Vitesse Arnhem, has signed a new deal until 2019 with Chelsea.", "S4C chief executive Ian Jones said there had been a \"substantial\" decrease in such programming and \"we would support on all levels increasing that\".\nMr Jones was giving evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee on the BBC's future.\nBBC Wales said recently that protecting news and politics coverage from cuts had made other programming \"thinner\".\nThe comments in April, by BBC Wales director Rhodri Talfan Davies, followed a speech by BBC director-general Tony Hall in which he admitted programming in Wales had been \"eroded\".\nOn Tuesday, Mr Jones said focusing on the success of programmes such as Doctor Who and Casualty was a \"red herring\".\n\"The production of Doctor Who and Casualty in Wales - it's good, it's extremely good, it helps the skills base, it helps competition and it helps the perception of producing, but I don't think that's the issue, that is in fact a red herring,\" he said.\n\"I think the people of Wales would appreciate more programming - more local programming through the medium of English.\n\"If I have any criticism of the BBC in Wales, that criticism is shared by former BBC directors in Wales and, I suspect, the current BBC director, in that there's been a substantial decrease in programming produced and commissioned over the years in the English language for the people of Wales and we would support on all levels increasing that.\"\nMr Jones cited the example of Hinterland, a recent collaboration between S4C and BBC, which was broadcast in both Welsh and English, and bought by a number of Scandinavian broadcasters as a recent success, which according to Mr Jones, showed there was increasing demand for local programmes.\nReferring to the relationship between the BBC and S4C, Mr Jones said it was working well because the operating agreement between the two stipulates that S4C is independent operationally, managerially and editorially.\nA BBC Wales spokesperson said: \"We obviously welcome Ian Jones's contribution to the discussion about the future of the BBC.\n\"As the BBC's director general recognised in May, the funding challenges facing English television programming in Wales are both significant and longstanding.\"", "29 January 2016 Last updated at 07:34 GMT\nMattel, the US company who make the toy, is adding \"tall, curvy and petite\" body shapes to its line-up.\nDifferent skin tones, eye colours and hair styles will also be added, the company said.\nMany people had complained that the traditional Barbie size was unhealthy, creating an unrealistic body image for girls.\nWith the new body shapes, the toy makers say they are \"offering girls choices that are more reflective of the world they see today\".", "But the report found helmets meeting the newest safety standards would not have saved his life.\nHughes, 25, was stuck by a bouncer during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground in November 2014.\nThe review, commissioned by Cricket Australia, also highlights a need for 'concussion substitutes'.\nHughes was struck on the neck and died in hospital two days later.\nThe governing body of the sport in Australia asked barrister David Curtain to lead the review into the incident.\nHe recommends that batsmen, wicketkeepers and close fielders in first-class cricket should wear protective helmets that meet stringent British safety standards in matches and in training.\nBut he said such helmets would not have saved Hughes' life.\n\"I do not believe the new helmet would have afforded additional protection against the blow given the location of where Phillip was struck, as the protection to the neck, at the rear, is no different,\" he said.\nHe also called for more evaluation into the effectiveness of clip-on neck guards in preventing a similar incident.\nThe review also looked into the medical care given to Hughes before an ambulance arrived some 20 minutes after the incident. It concluded \"the attention received by Phillip after being struck had no role whatsoever on his subsequent demise, due to the nature and severity of his injury\".\nCurtain said it was beyond his remit to call for substitutes to be allowed to bat and bowl when a player has to leave the field due to concussion - under current rules, replacements are not allowed to do this.\nBut he added it was a \"concern\" that some players might not want to leave the field and leave their team short and said it was an area for Cricket Australia to explore.\nCricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said a number of recommendations in the review had already been implemented.\nHe added the body was already \"exploring the possibility of allowing a 'concussion substitute' during domestic matches\" and that the International Cricket Council would look at the issue at its next meeting on 31 May.\nA coronial inquest in Hughes's death will take place in October.", "In a letter to the Times, Nick Clegg, Ken Clarke and Jacqui Smith said jails had become unacceptably dangerous.\nThey said inmate numbers had risen to more than 85,000 since Michael Howard declared in 1993 that \"prison works\".\nThe cross-party trio pointed out that almost half of inmates are re-convicted within a year of being released.\nFormer Lib Dem leader and deputy PM Mr Clegg, ex-Conservative Home Secretary Mr Clarke and former Labour Home Secretary Mrs Smith said the recent violent unrest at Birmingham Prison was a \"wake-up call for this country\".\nRiot teams restored order to all four wings of HMP Birmingham last week after more than 12 hours of rioting described as the worst since events at Strangeways 26 years ago.\nRiot officers regain control of Birmingham prison\nReality check: Do England and Wales lock up more inmates?\nThe trio's letter said there had been a 31% increase in prison assaults in the past year, and one prisoner killed themselves every three days.\n\"We believe that an escalating prison population has gone well beyond what is safe or sustainable,\" they wrote.\n\"To restore order, security and purpose to our jails, ministers should now make it their policy to reduce prison numbers.\n\"If the tide is not turned soon, the prisons crisis will do untold damage to wider society.\"\nMr Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that it was \"with the benefit of hindsight and in a non-partisan way\" that he, Mr Clarke and Mrs Smith were able to make the suggestions.\n\"All Ken and Jackie and I are saying is yes, if we chose to as a country, we could move to American style levels of mass incarceration - it's very expensive, it's very ineffective - or, we can try and think again and make our prison estate smaller, safer and more effective in dealing with crime,\" he said.\nCutting the number of inmates to 45,000 would bring the prison population close to what it was under Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government, the letter said.\n\"The system is not serving victims of crime or properly protecting our communities either,\" it said, but did not explain how the three thought the reduction could be achieved.\nJustice Secretary Liz Truss has said violence in prisons \"will not be tolerated\".\n\"I started work at the prison more than 10 years ago. It was my first prison job and I was a fresh recruit.\nI felt safe at first. During the first few years I could count the amount of times I felt fearful for my own safety on one hand.

Afterwards the French complained that some riders, including Lance Armstrong and the winner Alberto Contador were given preferential treatment when it came to surprise tests.\nThis year the AFLD has been excluded from direct participation in the testing process.\nMr Bordry suggests that his agency's targeted testing, based on customs information and enforced by French police, is a more effective weapon than simply screening samples.\nMr Bordry says that the presence of international observers from the World Anti-Doping Agency, Wada, highlights his concerns.\n\"I think if this year there are three people from Wada to control UCI, surely there is a reason for that?\" he said.\n\"If there was no problem last year, there wouldn't be any people from Wada as observers? If the UCI system was credible there wouldn't be any people from Wada. So we will see if it becomes credible with Wada people.\"\nMr Bordry also says the recently introduced biological passport is flawed.\nThe passport works by establishing a biological profile of riders.\nProfessional cyclists give samples of blood and urine several times a year.\nAny deviation from their normal values is taken as an indication of doping even if the exact substance isn't known.\nBut Mr Bordry says cyclists can get around it by consistently taking small amounts of doping substances.\n\"I have no information about the blood passport from the UCI, I have information from some cyclists like Bernard Kohl saying some cyclists can do what they like with the passport, so if they have the same profile all the year, if they are doped all the year, they have a good passport,\" Mr Bordry said.\n\"The passport is not a good organisation for anti doping. I don't believe in the blood passport as it is done now.\"\nThe UCI rejects the accusations and says the decision to exclude the AFLD from this year's tour was made by the World Anti-Doping Agency.\nThe governing body says its testing is rigorous and effective and they will do their best to protect cycling, to protect the tour and to reduce the risk of any doping offence.\nTheir spokesman Enrico Carpani also defended the biological passport.\n\"We have created the most sophisticated tool that many other international sports organisation would like to introduce,\" he said.\n\"We are explaining, we are selling the biological passport to other federations so that's proof that this new approach is the most important and the most reliable that sport has today to fight against doping.\"\nSo bad have relations between the two organisations become that Mr Bordry is refusing to let his scientists work with the UCI on new methods of catching dopers.\n\"I won't work with UCI - I don't want to work with UCI,\" he said.\n\"We work with a lot of doctors and specialists all over the world, so we have no international problem but we don't want to work with the UCI on these projects, because they are not scientific people.\"", "The large numbers have sparked such a profound crisis that the local mayor threatened this week to stop voters taking part in Sunday's general election unless he received more help from the government in Athens.\nAt the peak in August and early September, up to 1,500 Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans were arriving every day, according to local officials.

They were compared with 57 men of the same age.\nMen born from ICSI had almost half the sperm concentration and a two-fold lower total sperm count and motile sperm - that can swim well - than men of a similar age whose parents conceived naturally.\nThey were also nearly three times more likely to have sperm concentrations below the World Health Organization's definition of a \"normal\" level - 15 million per millilitre of semen - and four times more likely to have total sperm counts below 39 million.\nProf Andre Van Steirteghem, who led the study, said it had been the first chance to test the long-held theory that sons would inherit sperm quality issues.\nBut he said it was a more complex picture than might have been expected: \"Semen characteristics of ICSI fathers do not predict semen values in their sons.\n\"It is well established that genetic factors play a role in male infertility, but many other factors may also interfere.\"\nProf Richard Sharpe, leader of the Male Reproductive Health Research Team at the University of Edinburgh, said that since most cases of male infertility were unexplained, it was uncertain that the father's fertility problems would be \"inherited\".\nHe added: \"Importantly, the results are a reminder to us that ICSI is not a treatment for male infertility, but simply a way of bypassing a problem and leaving it for the next generation to deal with - something my generation seem horribly adept at doing.\"\nBut Allan Pacey, professor of andrology at the University of Sheffield, said the findings were \"reassuring\".\n\"Twenty years ago we were telling parents that their sons might have the same problems as they did and that they would also need ICSI to reproduce.

It took a penalty shootout to separate the teams in the end, but with Rangers having played to their potential and Ronny Deila's side falling short of their own, the result was more than justified.\nRangers manager Mark Warburton stressed that work must continue to improve the squad, while chairman Dave King indicated plans remain in place to strengthen the squad.\nSo, what does the immediate future hold as Rangers prepare for next season's Scottish Premiership campaign?\nRangers only named five substitutes at Hampden, including 17-year-old midfielder Liam Burt. Injuries to Martyn Waghorn and Harry Forrester left the squad short up front, along with Michael O'Halloran and Billy King being ineligible.\nThe team needs strengthening - and the squad also needs more depth. Rangers have been relatively fortunate with injuries this season, but if the team wins the Scottish Cup final against Hibernian then Europa League commitments would place further strain on the squad.\nYet Warburton wanted a small, tight group to ensure all the players would be regularly involved and to maintain their hunger and desire.\nA smaller squad also provides a route to the first team for players from the youth set-up, but Rangers were light on options on Sunday with substitutes Nicky Law, Nicky Clark and Gedion Zelalem only being bit-part figures this term.\nThe starting line-up also needs additions in key positions. For all that Wes Foderingham is comfortable on the ball and so contributes significantly to Rangers' approach of building from the back, doubts remain about the goalkeeper.\nRob Kiernan and Danny Wilson played well on Sunday, but Rangers have been fragile at the back at times. That might be improved by the presence of an experienced, assertive and physically imposing holding midfielder, a position Warburton has long sought to fill.\nThe team needs more height and prowess in the air. Rangers tend to take short corners but still need to be able to defend their own area at set pieces. A centre-forward is also required, along with more options for the wide areas to provide competition.\nNone of that will be news to Warburton, who has been planning for next season, and the new recruits will need to fit into his game plan, so be technically adroit and tactically flexible.\nWarburton has generally preferred to sign players he knows, either from working with them at Watford or Brentford or coming up against them in the Championship, League One or academy level.\nThat can be restrictive, but the examples of Andy Halliday and Jason Holt ought to encourage a wider perspective. Both impressed in training before they were offered deals and have emerged as key players for the Ibrox side.\nThey were prominent, influential and accomplished on Sunday, setting the tempo and tone of the team's display. That reflects their performances this season.\nRangers' possession game was vital to their semi-final win. It established their confidence and assurance in the first half and took the sting out of Celtic's resurgence after the break.\nWhen Rangers were under pressure, the instinctive reliance on passing and movement restored some composure to their play. The team is also more comfortable in possession because the defence can be left exposed by the attacking full-backs and the way Holt and Halliday can play high up the pitch.\nYet for all that time on the ball, Rangers created fewer clear-cut chances against Celtic. There is a balance between routine and meaningful possession, which Warburton's team has tended to fall on the right side of more often than not, but stepping up a level, or two if they reach Europe, will mean that the approach needs to be executed by better players.\nWarburton has established foundations for the club to build on. The 4-3-3 shape and possession-based approach is used throughout the youth set-up and the philosophy will run deep at the training ground.\nIt has delivered success this season and can do so again in the next campaign. Warburton managed the same feat when he took Brentford from League One to the Championship play-off places.\nRangers fans have rediscovered the joy of following their team after a spell in the doldrums and amidst off-field turmoil. Ensuring that feel-good factor continues is important for the board as much as the team.\nSeason tickets need to be sold in large enough numbers to reduce the need for external investment from directors and shareholders as part of the rebuilding process, although that funding will be available when required.\nKeeping Warburton at Ibrox will also be critical to that sense of optimism - although the club must always have a succession plan in place and a clear strategy for maintaining the progress the Englishman has made.\nHe will be intrigued by a potential experience of European football and has stressed his commitment to the project at Ibrox. Suitors, though, will only have been impressed by the work carried out this season and some will inevitably come calling.\nThe shrewdest approach for the club is to accept that managers come and go, develop a long-standing strategy that maintains continuity and guides the search for successors, and establish a recruitment department and policy that works with - but is independent to - whoever is in charge of the first team.\nThat can all happen in time. For now, Rangers are on the right course, but with much work still to do to achieve the club's goals.", "\"That is what makes me unique and separates me from the others,\" O'Sullivan, 40, told BBC Sport.\n\"Watching sport, I am a winner's man but I like to be entertained too.

Chiefly, the organisers lacked broader military backing and failed to gain public and political support.\nBut another explanation may lie in the very different ideas the two sides had about how to get their message across.\nLate on Friday evening, the scheme seemed well-planned, with rebel troops sealing off Istanbul's bridges over the Bosphorus, surrounding the city's Ataturk airport and stationing tanks outside the presidential palace in Ankara.\nBut while they also raided major news organisations, the rebels failed to control the narrative and fundamentally misunderstood the significance of social media.\nA statement from the group, read on state broadcaster TRT by a journalist reportedly being held at gunpoint, announced that a \"Peace at Home Council\" was running the country and a curfew and martial law would be declared.\nWhat you need to know: A brief explainer of a complex story\n\"What's happening to our country?\": Shock in Taksim Square, Istanbul\nWho was behind the plot?: The thorny relationship between Turkey's government and military\nTurkey's ruthless president: Recep Tayyip Erdogan in profile\nTroops also stormed CNN Turk during the night, its Facebook live feed left showing an empty desk and chair.\n\"We are broadcasting until the last minute, as we think it is important for Turkish democracy and the future of the country,\" said CNN Turk anchor Basak Sengul, before being ushered out of the studio.\nIt was Mr Erdogan's message, however, that proved most important and which, combined with similar statements from other senior Turkish politicians, showed the country's democratic leadership was safe and well.\nBy the time he flew back to Istanbul from the Marmaris holiday resort in southern Turkey, thousands had defied the curfew, some lying down in front of tanks to halt their movement.\nEven if those behind the coup had been able to control traditional media, they could not stop people accessing news on Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and other platforms.\nMonitoring site Turkey Blocks said key sites including Facebook and Youtube had been blocked as the uprising began, later adding that they had seen a two-hour period of social media \"throttling\" but no evidence of a full internet blackout. Twitter has backed up this assessment.\nWhile such sites have been blocked in previous crises, it is possible the government wanted to keep them up as this worked to their advantage.\nWhat is more, Turkey has a vibrant social media community, and one that knows how to circumvent any restrictions.\nThose behind the coup never appeared in full command of the situation, and that was amplified online.\nMr Erdogan even sent a nationwide text out asking people to stand up for democracy, a trick lost on the faction responsible.\nIf the plotters had owned a textbook on overthrowing a government, it was out of date and from a pre-internet era. What they needed was something for the 21st Century.\nFor some observers, the big irony of the night was that a tool that has come under attack from Mr Erdogan's government helped save him.\nMr Erdogan once vowed to \"wipe out\" Twitter, after the platform helped mobilise mass protests in 2013. Yet as Friday's events developed he used it to send a string of tweets rallying his supporters.\nZeynep Tufekci, of the University of North Carolina but who was in Turkey during the coup, tweeted this during the night: \"Never thought I'd write: Erdogan takes to Twitter & FaceTime as a coup attempt in Turkey is thwarted by gov't supporters using social media.\"", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nFormer triathlon world champion Stanford, 27, finished fourth in the event at this summer's Olympics in Rio, just missing out on a medal.\nShe wanted to run in the 10,000m at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, but did not compete in Glasgow because of injury.\n\"We're not sure how doable that is right now,\" Leeds-based Stanford told BBC Sport.\n\"They haven't, as far as I know, released the qualifying time or the timetabling to see if it's possible to double up.\n\"It's a different challenge and something a bit fresher and maybe [I can] look at a few different types of racing.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nStanford was ruled out of Glasgow 2014 by a stress fracture in her left ankle and hopes to make her Commonwealth Games debut in two years' time in Gold Coast, Australia.\nSwansea-born Stanford will be in action at this weekend's ITU World Triathlon Series grand final in Cozumel, Mexico with compatriot Helen Jenkins also on the start line.\nShe is keen to put her Olympic disappointment behind her, having been beaten to the bronze medal by British team-mate and housemate Vicky Holland.\n\"It was a tough couple of weeks and I had mixed emotions,\" Stanford added.\n\"Vicky was third and I was absolutely delighted she was able to bring a medal home, but at the same time managing your own disappointment.\n\"For both of us it's been a bit of a rollercoaster but the most important thing to us is that whatever happened at the Games we would still be friends.\n\"For me, it means there's unfinished business with the Games.\n\"I'm still only 27 so it's not unrealistic for me to aim for another four years.\n\"I'm settled into the mindset that I will still be around in four years' time trying to win a medal for GB there.\"", "Channel 4 will take on the BBC's F1 broadcast rights from next season.\n\"The current financial position of the BBC means some tough and unwanted choices have to be made,\" said Barbara Slater, the BBC's director of sport.\nHowever, BBC Radio 5 live has extended its commentary rights for F1 until the 2021 season.\nBBC Sport broadcast 10 live races of Briton Lewis Hamilton's world championship-winning season in 2015 with a one-hour build-up to each grand prix.

I'd give them a seven - they are still not quite firing on all cylinders and, as captain Alastair Cook admitted, there were moments when they took their foot off the pedal. But that is probably being picky.\nIt is always hard to accurately assess a team when their opponents are poor, as Sri Lanka have been for most of this series.\nBut one thing is clear: James Anderson is bowling absolutely brilliantly. Even if he was up against top-class batsmen, he would still be making the ball do the same things.\nHe is at the top of his game and his elevation to the top of the Test bowling rankings is richly deserved.\nFast bowling is such a fickle game, and so much of it depends on rhythm - the elusive code that is so hard to describe or quantify. Anderson was bereft of rhythm in South Africa, but suddenly he is running up happy again, 'kissing' the pitch and taking stacks of wickets.\nYou could argue that better batsmen would play him better, but in these conditions, moving the ball both ways, Anderson is a dangerous proposition for anyone on the planet.\nYou cannot underestimate the importance of the overs he bowled for Lancashire earlier in the season, taking 12 wickets at an average of 20.75 in three matches.\nNo matter who you are and how much Test cricket you have played, you do not get your rhythm back in the nets.\nWhat a contrast with Steven Finn. Finn was arguably the bowler of the series in South Africa, where Anderson struggled, but now his rhythm seems to have deserted him again.\nHe is not doing anything wrong - I know well from my own playing days that sometimes you can run in with just as much effort and think you are letting the ball go just as fast as always, but it just does not come out with the same snap.\nWhat worries me is that he has got no opportunity to rediscover his rhythm before the final Test at Lord's begins on 9 June - there is only one T20 Blast match for Middlesex that he could possibly play in.\nFinn has to play at Lord's. There has been some talk that England might want to have a look at Jake Ball, who has been in the squad for the first two Tests, but he can bide his time. Finn knows Lord's well and this might be his opportunity to get some form back.\nEven when you are winning, you must look to move the team on, and there are a couple of areas that will be causing the England management some concern at the moment.\nJonny Bairstow has been brilliant with the bat this summer but his wicketkeeping remains a work in progress. He does make mistakes: he drops catches and misses stumpings.\nIt is a very hard job, and slow-motion replays can be very cruel on keepers because you think 'how has he missed that?' But it happens in an absolute flash.\nBut I do not think his position behind the stumps is under threat. Unfortunately, those misses can sometimes be costly and, if he makes too many, his place as a keeper will come under scrutiny.\nThe other problem is the form of Nick Compton at three. Although he will be mighty relieved to have got 22 not out in the second innings as England chased 79 to win in Durham, his problem is that he has not scored heavy runs all summer - for England or Middlesex.\nLord's is a ground he knows well and he will be desperate to do well. It will be a flatter pitch than we have seen so far this summer and the conditions should be easier for batting.\nIf England can win the toss and bat first, he will have a really good opportunity to nail down that position - that is the way he will be looking at it.\nI do not think his England place necessarily hinges on how he plays in the third Test - there is quite a big break between that game and the first Test against Pakistan on 14 July and he could go away and score a stack of runs for Middlesex.\nBut if he does not get a score people will be looking at him even more.\nOne man whose place certainly is not under scrutiny is Cook. What an incredible achievement for him to become the first Englishman to reach 10,000 Test runs.\nHe has done it in the hardest possible way - opening the batting, much of it with the burden of captaincy, and with uncertainty over his partner at the other end. Those are three ingredients with which most people would find incredibly difficult to succeed.\nYou must have absolute admiration for him. He is not a stylist and he does not have people dashing in to watch him, but that is Test cricket.\nYou need players like Cook to blunt attacks and lay the buildings blocks of an innings for the team. He has fulfilled that role absolutely brilliantly, and he will go on.\nFor a while, he was as obdurate with his captaincy as he was with his batting and, as a skipper, you do not really want that. But he has definitely opened up over the past year and his confidence has grown enormously.\nYet he can still go out to bat, put everything away and focus on what he has to do with a bat in his hand - and that is a great testimony to him.\nThat focus has been in some ways Cook's defining quality as a Test batsman, and it was in evidence right from the very beginning.\nI remember him arriving in Nagpur after that long journey from the West Indies, just two days before making his debut, and he made 60 and a hundred.\nYou thought, 'this bloke's pretty special', because he can focus totally on batting.

Going to them and saying, 'please do the right thing' is kind of naive.\"\nTake-away: When it comes to populist economics in today's Democratic Party, Mr Sanders is sitting on the political high ground.\n\"I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone,\" Mrs Clinton said at one point when defending herself against the charge that she has changed positions on issues based on political expediency.\nThe clunkiness of the line was typical of Mrs Clinton's difficulty, at times, in dealing with charges that her views are based on politics and not principle.\nAgain and again, within the give and take of the debate, Mrs Clinton left herself vulnerable to attack. Her opponents were either unwilling (Mr Sanders and Martin O'Malley) or incapable (Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee) of seizing the advantage.\nTake-away: Mrs Clinton is a skilled debater, but she had her flaws.

He then provided a lovely ball from deep that Defoe ran on to and easily turned James Tomkins to fire in.\nAt the start of the game, Defoe was the only Sunderland player in their starting line-up to score this season and while Moyes will be heartened to see two others contribute, his 34-year-old star striker gave yet another reminder why he alone will largely determine the Black Cats' fate this season.\nDefoe now has 14 Premier League goals this season out of the 24 Sunderland have scored in total as he came back to haunt the manager who he helped to keep the Black Cats up last year.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nPrior to the game, Palace boss Allardyce said he would \"hate\" to see a repeat performance of the defeat by Swansea in early January.\nHe got something far worse.

The lads find it difficult to play here at the moment.\"\n\"It is not often the players get much stick but they deserved the booing. I have to apologise for the first half.\"\nAllardyce has never been relegated from the Premier League, but he could see that record end this season if his side continue to perform like this.\nThis was Sunderland's second straight Premier League clean sheet but their first away from home this season and, although Palace's finishing was poor, it was another impressive performance from centre-back Kone.\nHe took his goal well, hooking his effort inside the far post after Hennessey could only parry Kone's intitial header under pressure from Billy Jones.\nBut it was the way he easily handled Christian Benteke throughout that was most striking, overpowering the Belgium striker and carrying the ball into midfield to release pressure and start attacks.\nFollowing another solid showing in the goalless draw with Tottenham in midweek, Kone, 28, looks to be back to the level that saw him coveted by other Premier League clubs last season.\nCrystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce: \"Fear gripped the players and it hasn't allowed them to express their ability.

We've hit the big four-oh!\nThe median age of the UK population (that is the age at which half the population is younger and half the population is older) at mid-2014 was at its highest ever at 40.0.\nHere's the graph to prove it:\nThe end of World War Two brought the first baby-boom.

It's a blessing and a challenge, as the NHS and pensions try to keep up with a longer life expectancy.\nThe ONS has a little present to celebrate this milestone - it calls them a population pyramid -

and families face excessively long waiting times,\" said Mr Trobe.\nAccording to the National Association of Head Teachers, about three-quarters of schools already lack the funds to provide good enough mental health care for pupils.\n\"Rising demand, growing complexity and tight budgets are getting in the way of helping the children who need it most,\" said NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby.\n\"Moves to make schools more accountable for the mental health of their pupils must first be accompanied by sufficient school funding and training for staff and should focus only on those areas where schools can act, including promotion of good mental health, identification and signposting or referrals to the appropriate services,\" he added.\nFor Ms Kane, the emphasis is on making the schools she runs \"safe and welcoming places\".\nCounselling and other forms of psychological support were more important than ever as changes to the exam system \"are creating more stress\", she said.\n\"There is a lot of memorising required and less course work.\"\nThe school holds assemblies for candidates, on how to revise and relax, and mindfulness training.\nAnd there are lessons in small groups for some of the more vulnerable pupils.\nThere is also an emphasis on sport, and the school encourages volunteering.\n\"You feel better if you help someone else,\" said Ms Kane.\n\"We want students to learn strategies for life.

Northern Ireland was hosting its eighth Clinton visit, and perhaps it was a sign that patience was wearing thin as the couple were booed as they left the Clinton Peace Centre in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh.\nIt was not that they were no longer welcome in the town - the boos were from spectators who were disappointed when the couple left without the usual meet-and-greet contact that had been the highlight of previous visits.\nFour years later, when Mrs Clinton was challenging Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, she cited Northern Ireland as one example of her greater foreign policy experience.\nHowever, she was criticised for \"exaggerating\" her role in the peace process after she told CNN: \"I helped to bring peace to Northern Ireland.\"\nForced to defend her comments, she said: \"I actually went to Belfast more than Bill did, as part of what I was doing to help the process.\"\nHer critics included former Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble, who dismissed her claims as a \"wee bit silly\".\n\"I don't know there was much she did apart from accompanying Bill [Clinton] going around,\" Lord Trimble said at the time.\n\"I don't want to rain on the thing for her, but being a cheerleader for something is slightly different from being a principal player.\"\nBut Lord Trimble's fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner, SDLP leader John Hume who is a long-time friend of the Clintons, defended her contribution.\n\"I am quite surprised that anyone would suggest that Hillary Clinton did not perform important foreign policy work as first lady,\" Mr Hume said in 2008.\nWhen she became America's top diplomat the following year, Mrs Clinton returned to Belfast to address the Northern Ireland Assembly.\nShe told MLAs that US investment had helped to create about 20,000 jobs in Northern Ireland since the early days of the peace process in 1994.\nSecretary of State Clinton also appointed an economic envoy to Northern Ireland on behalf of the US government.\nStormont's Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said Mrs Clinton had been \"a true friend\" to Northern Ireland.\nShe was back in 2012 but this time her trip coincided with the start of the union flag dispute, and Mrs Clinton was once again condemning violence on the streets.\nShe challenged political leaders to tackle sectarianism and political divisions at a grassroots level.\n\"What we have to do is get out of the ballrooms, out of Stormont and into the communities where people live, where they do not have that lasting hope of optimism,\" she said.\nAfter giving her a personal tour of the newly built Titanic centre, the then First Minister Peter Robinson defended the peace process, saying \"this ship is not going down\".\nLast year, Mrs Clinton was inducted into the Irish America Hall of Fame and used her speech to praise the role of women in cementing the Northern Ireland peace process.\nShe said she was accepting the honour \"on behalf of all the remarkable women that I met and admired in Northern Ireland\".", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nSince then, Young has seen more than 1,500 Spartans games in a row.

The IDF is reviewing the incident,\" it said.\nThe UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) says a 3km (1.9 mile) wide strip, encompassing 44% of Gaza, has been designated as a no-go zone by the Israeli military.\nIsrael imposed restrictions on the Gaza Strip in 2006, after Hamas abducted Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit.\nThe measures were tightened by Israel and Egypt in 2007, after Hamas ousted rival Fatah and forcibly took control in Gaza after winning elections the year before.\nHamas and Fatah announced a reconciliation deal in April, but the move was condemned by Israel which regards Hamas as a terrorist group.\nIsrael's Science Minister Yaakov Peri told Israeli web portal Walla that he did not see a ceasefire being agreed in the coming days, as the IDF needed more time to dismantle Hamas' underground tunnel network.\nBut in his BBC interview, Mr Meshaal was critical of the way Israel targeted Palestinian homes in aerial bombardments, saying a three-minute signal to leave - one of Israel's warning measures - was not a \"proper warning\".\n\"A Palestinian has built this home with his money. Are Israelis expecting him to leave just like that?\"\nHe said Israel was unable to reach the underground rocket launchers, belonging \"to the resistance\".\n\"This is why it pretends that they are in civilian areas so Israel is hitting hospitals mosques, towers and buildings,\" the militant leader said.\nPalestinian medical sources said the death toll in Gaza had risen to 797 on Thursday. Of these, 191 were children and 67 were women, officials said.\nIsrael says 31 soldiers, two Israeli civilians and a Thai worker in the Israeli city of Ashkelon have been killed since 8 July.\nThousands of Palestinians also took part in a protest in the West Bank against Israel's military offensive.\nAt least two were killed after Israeli soldiers opened fire, and doctors said hundreds were also injured.", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nHaving drawn 1-1 in Glasgow, the Scots led twice in Madrid through goals from Emma Mitchell and Kim Little.\nBut Spain equalised through Adriana and then Silvia Meseguer.\nWith the Scots set to go through on away goals, Vero made up for a penalty miss moments before by forcing in a shot in injury time of extra-time.\nThe Scotland players were utterly disconsolate as the final whistle blew immediately, with a first ever place at a major finals having been snatched from their grasp.\nSpain had started in lively fashion and might have gone in front as early as the fourth minute.\nA lovely run and chipped pass from Vero eventually found its way back to the striker, whose shot was diverted wide.\nMegan Sneddon had Scotland's first sight of goal on 17 minutes but the midfielder dragged her shot well wide, while Jenny Beattie's long-range free-kick flew high over the crossbar.\nJane Ross was similarly wayward with a shot but Scotland had really worked their way into the match by the half-hour mark.\nRhonda Jones headed wide from a Little free-kick before a moment of consternation in Scotland's six-yard box ended with the Spanish midfielder Jennifer guiding the ball just past.\nBeattie's strength was causing the Spaniards problems and she came mightily close to a Scottish opener seven minutes before the break, but her low drive from a tight angle flew narrowly wide.\nThe Scots went even closer when Beattie hoisted the ball into the box where it was met by Jones, but the defender's header was well saved.\nThere was an even better stop at the other end by Fay, who rushed off her line to block Adriana's shot when it looked as though Spain were about to take a half-time lead.\nEarly in the second half, Scotland should really have gone a goal up when Rachel Corsie found herself unmarked six yards out, but she screwed her shot off-target.\nBut the visitors finally got the goal they had been threatening on 62 minutes.\nRoss charged down the right before delivering a terrific deep cross, which was swept into the net at the back post by Mitchell.\nThe goal provoked a reaction from the Spanish and they produced an equaliser of genuine quality when Adriana jinked in from the left before curling home a beautiful shot.\nThe Scotland keeper did superbly to tip a long-range Sonia free-kick over with 12 minutes remaining and she also held a header from Jennifer as a resurgent Spain sought the winner.\nSpanish captain Sandra poked the ball over the bar in the final minute but Scotland had a glorious chance to seal the tie in injury time, only for substitute Eilish McSorley to nudge the ball wide from a corner with the goal gaping.\nVero then shot wide three minutes into time added on when she should have done better and, with that, extra-time beckoned.\nBoth sides were becoming weary on the rain-soaked pitch, but it was the visitors who found the extra energy to recapture the lead.\nLittle, who scored from the penalty spot at Hampden at the weekend, dribbled her way past two players before arrowing a shot in off the post, to put Scotland in command of the tie.\nThe Spanish were not finished yet though. Rachel Small cleared a Sonia cross off the line before Meseguer rocketed home the equaliser to ensure a nervy final nine minutes.\nSonia again went close before Fay pulled off a simply astonishing save to deny Vero from the penalty spot with two minutes remaining after the referee had spotted a handball.\nBut there was further drama to come as with the final kick of the ball, Vero scuffed a volley past Fay to deny Scotland in the cruellest of manners.\nFollow Alasdair Lamont on Twitter.", "The court said he had a right to freedom of expression, enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights.\nLithuanian authorities had barred Henrikas Jankovskis from going online to apply for a law course, citing security concerns.\nBut the court ruled they had not provided sufficient reasons for a ban.\nIt pointed out that the websites Jankovskis had wanted to visit were all government-run.\nThe right of access to the internet has gone before the ECHR before.\nIn January 2016, it said that governments were not allowed to stop a person receiving information but that did not mean there was a general obligation to provide prisoners with access to the internet or specific websites.\nEuropean governments widely limit prisoners' access to specific websites on security grounds.\nIn the latest case, the court agreed that the Lithuanian prisoner should be allowed on to websites that featured learning and study programmes because they were relevant to his aim to further his education.\nIt said that Lithuania had violated Article 10 of the human rights convention, and that interfering in his right to receive that specific information \"cannot be regarded as having been necessary in a democratic society\".\n\"Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.

Years later, the truth emerged: the works were actually not created by Walter, but by his wife Margaret - who painted them in secret while her husband took the credit.\nWhy did she go along with the deception? Would the paintings have become famous without the smooth-talking Walter to promote them?\nThese are questions that Burton explores in Big Eyes, which stars Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz as the Keanes, alongside Terence Stamp as New York art critic John Canaday who describes the artworks as \"an infinity of kitsch\".\nThe film reunites Burton with writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, who worked with him on 1994 biopic Ed Wood, about the cult film-maker.\nThe director tells the BBC why he has long been fascinated by the weird-eyed portraits and how he copes with sharp-penned critics.\nHow far back does your association with Keane paintings go?\nSince childhood. I always thought of it as suburban art, because everyone had it. It was in people's living rooms, offices, doctors' offices, dentists' offices. You know that in childhood some things leave your memory, but these things stuck with me.\nI'm interested in pop culture and things; it was just something that was very present and it wasn't until the mid-90s when a friend of mine in New York told me the story about the Keanes. Like most people, until that point I had thought that Walter was the painter of the work, because that's what I remember.  I was like 'wow - this is an amazing, interesting story'.\nWhen I was in San Francisco I visited Margaret [who still has a gallery there] and commissioned a painting from her. It was a couple of years later that I found out that Scott and Larry, who'd written Ed Wood, had a script based on the story.\nDo you see an affinity between Margaret Keane and Ed Wood, who were both artists some people sneered at?\nAs much as people trashed the whole thing, there were a lot of people trying to copy it.  I know a lot of people that are inspired by the 'big eye' thing. You have to admit that there's a reason why people had it in their living rooms. Even if you hate it, there's something there - it's like Ed Wood, he's the worst film-maker in the world but at the same time there was a weird poetry to his films and you could remember them over other films that won Academy Awards.\nThat question of what's good and bad is something that I've always been interested in, because I've experienced it myself. I do identify with those kind of characters, because there's two sides to the story.\nIt's a lower budget film, with very few special effects, in contrast to your past work. Did that make it more personal for you?\nAfter doing lots of big studio stuff, it was nice to strip back, have a low budget, and have to move quickly. That reconnects you with why you like making movies on a certain level. You don't hear the term franchise, you don't hear about the McDonalds tie-in,  so it's quite nice to not have that kind of spectre hanging over you.\nIn the film John Canaday, the art critic, says Mr Keane \"is why society needs critics to protect them from such atrocities\". What's your relationship been like with critics throughout your career?\nFrom the beginning of my career, films like Pee-wee's Big Adventure or Beetlejuice were in the top 10 worst films of the year.  I've had that Batman's too dark, and this and that... or some people like it.\nI feel lucky because I know people who make a film and it gets some great reviews, and then they're only in for a fall.\nI feel like I've been sort of well-balanced.   I had movies being horribly reviewed that do very well, and movies that are reviewed very well but do horribly at the box office.\nMy MoMA [Museum of Modern Art] show in New York recently got almost completely panned - probably worse than Keane. At the same time we had the highest attendance ratings.  So you get a mixture of things, in a bizarre way it balances you out.\nDo you find at this stage of your career that you deal with criticism better than you did?\nI don't really read it too much. I actually have trouble looking at anything, even positive ones, or negative, I know enough - people tell me, so I'm not living in a dream world.\nYour next film is Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children - with Hugo star Asa Butterfield in the cast. What's your vision for the film?\nHugo doesn't seem like it was that long ago... [Asa] has obviously become a young adult, but he's still got an incredible presence, and I'm really looking forward to working with him.\nWhen I read Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, there was a vibe about it that felt different.  I think that's the key, to try to capture the spirit of the book.

The majority were vehemently opposed.\nThere were plenty - including, memorably, David Beckham - who maintained their association with United but made their feelings plain by wearing the green and gold colours of the club's first ever strip, which protestors adopted as their uniform of choice.\nMore militant figures left completely.\nThose responsible for its establishment maintain that FC United - based in Moston in Greater Manchester and now members of the Northern Premier League - was not formed in direct response to the Glazer takeover but as a result of the growing globalisation of the national game, which took it away from its traditional fan base.\nYet the fact remains that the fan-owned non-league side's first game was played in 2005, just weeks after the takeover and before Best's passing.\nThe reason for all the antipathy? Money.\nIn buying out major shareholders John Magnier and JP McManus, who had fallen out with Sir Alex Ferguson over the ownership of star racehorse Rock of Gibraltar, Glazer was effectively in the process of completing a \u00a3790m takeover with the club's own cash.\nThe prospect so alarmed some fans on the night the deal was completed that hundreds arrived at Old Trafford to voice their opposition, forcing three of Glazer's six children - current co-chairmen Joel and Avie, plus non-executive director Bryan - to be spirited out of the stadium in a van for their own safety.\nIn addition to the actual \u00a3525m debt dumped on the club's balance sheet after the takeover, it is estimated around \u00a3696m has been spent facilitating it, through interest payments, bank charges and debt repayment.\nUnited have gone from being the richest club in the world to the one that owes the most money.\nYet financial Armageddon, predicted by so many, failed to materialise.\nFor Glazer had been proved correct in his assessment of United as a cash cow, capable of generating vast sums in commercial income, which rose to a staggering  \u00a3152.5m last year and will take another substantial leap forwards when the club's annual results are released in September.\nIn adopting a franchise-based approach to their commercial operations, United opened the door to untold riches.\nEd Woodward, now executive vice-chairman, who drove through the Glazer takeover, set about maximising the club's off-field potential.\nIt brought alliances with airlines, tyre companies, watchmakers and crisp manufacturers, amongst others, taking United's brand into every corner of the globe, hunting down the 657m followers it is claimed they have.\nThe policy set the template every other major club has followed.\nCrucially, in those early days, Ferguson continued to deliver trophies.\nFrom 2007 to 2009, United won three Premier League titles, lifted one Champions League trophy, lost a final and reached another semi-final.\nThey won the League Cup, played in an FA Cup final and lost a semi-final. It represented the most prolific three-year spell in the club's history.\nTwo more championships were won before Ferguson called time on his illustrious tenure.\nThe Scot himself was a fervent champion of the Glazer regime, repeatedly praising the Americans for their stewardship.\n\"Malcolm Glazer never set foot in Old Trafford but was a figurehead of that controversial takeover of Manchester United.\n\"In terms of practicalities and the day-to-day running of the club, very little will change and the business will continue to be run on the same basis it has been for a number of years.\n\"The club's debt payments have been reduced but I think it is fair to say fan anger over those debts remains and will not go away.\"\nThere is debate about the precise words he used when confronted by fans at Budapest airport in 2006 ahead of a Champions League qualifier with Debrecen and questioned why he stood by a regime so loathed by supporters.\nYet Ferguson was brutally dismissive. It remained that way until the Scot's retirement.\nLong-standing chief executive David Gill, who had opposed the Glazer takeover as \"potentially damaging\" but opted to remain once the deal was signed, said in 2012 that those who maintained their offensive against the owners were \"anti-people\".\nYet many United fans looked beyond the silverware.\nThey preferred to question the relative lack of spending on a squad growing increasingly inadequate to match major rivals Chelsea and Manchester City.\nThrough it all, Glazer stayed away.\nInitially it was through choice, eventually ill-health. At no point did Glazer utter a word in public to either explain or defend his actions.\nThe ownership of United has long since been transferred to Glazer's six children, with all the signs that the club will carry on its chosen path.\nGlazer's death happens to have come at the most uncertain period for United on the pitch since 2005, with David Moyes, the man chosen to succeed Ferguson, sacked before completing a single season and the club finishing in their lowest league position for almost 25 years.\nFor this, some will blame Glazer outright. Others would prefer to imagine he never existed at all.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nGlazer will not be missed by the rank and file in Manchester, but he will never be forgotten.\nYet, for the strength of opinion against Glazer on this side of the Atlantic, in his homeland he is regarded as a  positive figure.\nFlags flew at half mast at the home of Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the American football franchise he owned, while players and officials paid warm tribute.\nAfter all, the Bucs lifted the Super Bowl under Glazer's stewardship in 2002. Their new stadium was his responsibility, too.\nThey may have been equally reluctant to speak in public, but in Tampa the Glazer family were afforded a warmth never replicated in Manchester.", "All of the managerial movements for May will appear below, followed by the full list of each club, league-by-league.\nTo read the list for April, visit the ins and outs page.", "Having bowled out Lancashire for 467, to set a target of 295 to win, Somerset looked in contention on 78-2.\nBut Anderson struck twice in 10 balls to remove ex-England team-mates Marcus Trescothick (36) and Steven Davies.\nRyan McLaren (4-37) and Jordan Clark (3-12) ensured Somerset were then shot out for 130 to lose by 164 runs.\nAfter being bowled out in their first innings for 109, before allowing Somerset to open up a first-innings lead of 169, Lancashire's hopes of getting anything other than three bonus points from the game looked grim when they fell to 23-2 second time around midway through day two.\nBut a 245-run third-wicket stand between stand-in skipper Liam Livingstone and wicketkeeper Alex Davies at least gave them something to bowl at.\nAnd, after lunching on 29-0, seven wickets went down for 78 runs in the afternoon session, including the key wicket of James Hildreth - lbw to McLaren for 43 -  to set up victory.\nSparked by Anderson's brilliant spell, only Hildreth and Trescothick made double figures as Somerset, coached by native Lancastrian Matt Maynard, suffered a second successive defeat.", "Everyone wanted tariff-free access to EU markets, the shadow chancellor said.\nBut there was a debate on-going within the Labour Party about whether the best option was continued membership or a separate agreement, he added.\nJeremy Corbyn has suggested the single market is \"inextricably linked\" to EU membership and the UK cannot remain.\nSpeaking on Sunday, the Labour leader said leaving the EU meant leaving the EU's internal market - whose members must abide by rules on the free movement of goods, capital, services, and labour.\nThe party's international trade spokesman, Barry Gardiner, has gone further, saying the UK should also rule out remaining in the customs union beyond any transitional period, claiming that failing to do so would make the UK a \"vassal state\" unable to negotiate sovereign trade deals.\nHowever, many Labour MPs disagree with both positions - arguing that it is in the UK's economic interests to remain in both. They point out there are non-EU members, like Norway, which have full access to the single market and countries such as Turkey which belong to the customs union.\nAnd Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones is arguing Labour should be pushing for the UK to remain in the single market - even though it might mean not being able to impose any controls on immigration from the EU.\nMr McDonnell insisted Labour had a \"straightforward\" position on the type of access the UK needed to its largest market after it leaves the EU in March 2019.\n\"Our objective is tariff-free access to the market,\" he said. \"That has been our objective since immediately after the referendum.\n\"The structures - whether we are in or out - are a secondary matter.\n\"We are not ruling anything out but what we are saying is that we are the fifth largest economy in the world and we have a special status in both our relationship with the EU and the rest of the globe and we feel we can get a deal that achieves tariff-free access.\"\nPressed on whether he and Mr Corbyn disagreed on the matter, he said: \"I think we are all on the same page with regard to our objectives... there is a debate around whether it is full membership or a new relationship or a separate agreement.\n\"What we are saying is keep our eye on what is the most important objective, tariff-free access. We can achieve that.\"\nThe BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was a \"deep internal divide\" within the party and the shadow chancellor was seeking to \"soften\" the party's stance following a backlash by pro-EU MPs and trade unionists over Mr Corbyn and Mr Gardiner's remarks\nAmid signs of growing internal strains over Brexit, the former shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said she had never felt \"more concerned\" about her party's position.\n\"My colleague Barry Gardiner's contribution to the Brexit debate, in which he argues for the UK to come out of the single market and customs union to facilitate Brexit was, for me, depressing and disingenuous in equal measure,\" she wrote in the Guardian.\nShe accused her colleague of using arguments on sovereignty, immigration and the legal jurisdiction that \"could have come straight out of Tory Central Office\", Instead, she said Labour must focus on the damage posed to those on low and middle incomes of a so-called hard Brexit.\nThe government has said the UK will leave the single market and customs union but could maintain some existing arrangements for an interim period to help British business adjust.", "Taylor took an indefinite break from cricket in May 2016 to help deal with anxiety problems.\nThe 28-year-old returned to England action for a one-day international against Ireland in Dubai in April.\n\"She'll have learned a lot about herself and faced up to a lot of battles,\" Robinson told BBC Sussex.\n\"She feels confident enough to put herself forward for selection.

and warns that international aid for education is below the levels of 2010.\nThe lack of education is also far worse among the poorest communities.\nAmong the poorest rural girls, only 1% are likely to reach upper secondary school.\nThe report from Unesco highlights the benefits of wider access to education - helping to build more stable, prosperous, peaceful societies, improving health and reducing child deaths.\nIt says that inequality in education \"heightens the risk of violence and conflict\" and that countries with high levels of education are much less likely to face conflict and war than the poorest, least-educated countries.\nThe study says if there was universal upper secondary education by 2030, per capita income in poorer countries would increase by 75% in the following 20 years.\nThe lack of facilities in schools is also examined, with a lack of electricity affecting many schools in sub-Saharan Africa.\nThe promise that all children should have the right to primary education was first made in 1990, with a commitment that it would be achieved in a decade.\nWhen that was missed, another 15-year target was set in 2000.\nIn 2015, the Sustainable Development Goals were adopted by world leaders, setting development targets to be reached by 2030.\nA year later, Unesco is suggesting that the promise of universal primary education is already off track.\nIf it really does take until 2042, it will be more than five decades after the international community made its first promise.\n\"This report should set off alarm bells around the world and lead to a historic scale-up of actions,\" said Jeffrey Sachs, economist and UN special adviser.\n\"The gaps in educational attainment between rich and poor, within and between countries, are simply appalling,\" said Mr Sachs.\n\"Today's children will be retiring before we manage to provide a decent education for every child,\" said Vikas Pota, chief executive of the Varkey Foundation, which runs the annual Global Teacher Prize.\n\"It is truly appalling that between 2013 and 2014 education aid actually fell by $600m -

In Nigeria, the UN agency says more than a third of primary age pupils are out of school.", "Written by Pat Mills and illustrated by the late Joe Colquhoun, it follows young Londoner Charley Bourne's fight to survive in the trenches of the Western Front.\nAfter starting his career with Dundee-based publisher DC Thomson, Mills co-created Battle with fellow comic book writer John Wagner and also launched British science-fiction/fantasy comic 2000AD.\nHere Mills gives an insight into writing Charley's War and why he believes how mechanised warfare - machine guns, zeppelins and planes - made WW1 the world's first science-fiction war.\n\"John Wagner and I did not want Battle to glorify war, and Charley's War is an anti-war story,\" said Mills. \"I think that in the 1970s and 80s it was legitimate, more so than it is today, to describe the Great War as a tragedy, a mistake and criticise the incompetence of generals. In 2014, revisionists have been trying to improve the image of the generals.\"\nMills' research drew on books, war-time poetry, soldiers' letters, archive photographs and satirical postcards, and some inspiration from 1969 film Oh! What a Lovely War. War-time letters were a major influence and correspondence between Charley and his mum, a munitions worker back home in Bethnal Green, was used as a plot device in the early strips.\n\"To write the story I had to understand the complexities of the trenches. It was a learning curve. I owe a lot to Charley's War because it made me a better writer,\" said Mills.\nArtist Colquhoun had served as a sailor during World War Two. Before illustrating Charley's War, he had provided the artwork for another Battle comic story, Johnny Red. Set in WW2, its hero is a British pilot fighting for the Russians. Mills said Colquhoun was a hugely talented but modest man. \"Joe had this great imagination. Other artists have told of him being able to imagine something, like a tank for example, from different angles. In Johnny Red, he created this amazing street scene of Stalingrad,\" said Mills.\nMills and Colquhoun were determined to root Charley's War in fact. The Battle of the Somme was among the battles featured.\nBut young Charley's face-off with an armour-clad German sniper proved controversial. Mills said: \"Some people did not think this was based in fact. A relative of mine who had served in World War Two also questioned the use of armour. But I had seen a photograph of armour made for use in World War One. It looked medieval.\"\nPhotographs from Getty Image's archives show US-designed armour, left, and also protection that would not look out of place in the pages of 2000AD.\n\"I didn't want Charley's War to be a story of derring-do and have Charley charging across different theatres of the conflict,\" said Mills. \"But sometimes it was necessary for him to leave the trenches to make a dramatic point, such as showing one of the last cavalry charges of the war. It looks so ludicrous, like something from the Battle of Balaclava, but a charge against machine guns.\"\n\"To me, the First World War was the world's first science-fiction war. It saw the first use of tanks, which terrified some of the Germans in their trenches when they first saw these machines.\" Mills and Colquhoun also featured Zeppelin airship bombing raids on London, aerial dogfights above the trenches and later heavily armed, armoured trains in the stories.\nMills said: \"We often imagine that Armageddon is a horror that awaits us sometime in the future. But Armageddon has already happened. It was World War One.\"", "Mauro Milanese took up the post in July 2014 but was dismissed from the League Two club in January 2015 following claims of \"serious misconduct\".\nThe club cited the breaking of good faith as one of the grounds for the ex-Italian international's dismissal.\nMrs Justice Whipple upheld the club's dismissal ruling at a hearing in London earlier.\nOf the six grounds given for sacking the 44-year-old, only one - described by the judge as \"by far and away the most serious\" - was upheld.\nIt related to his handling of an agreement involving an academy player, whose name was not disclosed to the court.\nThe judge ruled Milanese's involvement was a very serious breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence, and constituted gross misconduct.\nShe said the other issues relating to the transfer of two players, setting up his own business, accepting secret profits in connection with a transfer deal and overspending on players did not constitute gross misconduct.\nJustice Whipple said the former director of football was however entitled to \u00a38,300 worth of damages from the club for accrued salary and expenses.\nMilanese, who was not present in court, was ordered to pay \u00a3100,000 court costs.", "The huge sum - a combination of various payments - is detailed in a 429-page document lodged with the US Securities and Investment Commission (SEC).\nThe money includes the value of shares already owned, outstanding share options, a \"golden parachute\" payment, cash payments and medical benefits.\nYahoo investors are being asked to vote on the deal this June.\nThe total payments to Ms Mayer are far higher than the company first acknowledged last month when it explained that she would be entitled to the \"golden parachute\" payment for losing her job.\nMs Mayer will leave the company when the sale goes through.\nThe deal with Verizon was first announced last year when the struggling company,  agreed to sell its main internet business to Verizon, the huge US telecoms company, for $4.8bn.\nThat figure was later cut to $4.5bn after the company disclosed last autumn that it had been the victim, in 2013 and 2014, of two huge security breaches, the second of which affected the accounts of more than a billion customer accounts.\nEarlier this month Verizon said it would combine its AOL subsidiary and Yahoo into a new business called Oath.", "Dr Ron Hill MBE has competed in three Olympic Games.

many of the Scottish government's priority construction sectors such as infrastructure.\n\"Currently, while we know that there is a serious shortage of skills, we don't yet know why we have seen such a dramatic drop in the labour market over the past five years.\n\"Part of the problem is the legacy of the collapse in the sector following the onset of the global financial crisis.\n\"Many professionals and other skilled workers chose to leave the industry and quite simply have not returned or been replaced.\n\"A real focus on attracting more young people into the industry is critical alongside an expansion of apprenticeship opportunities.\"\nEarlier this month, a report prepared on behalf of the Scottish Building Federation suggested confidence among employers in the construction

told the pre-inquest review there had been one death there in 2015, followed by the two last July, but no remedial measures came in until after the five further deaths a month later.\n\"This is very much a case where the court will have to examine whether the local authority is to blame for these deaths,\" he said.\nThe coroner revealed a letter had been received from a \"thoroughly disaffected\"

discontinued.\nMr Craze said he had no intention of calling the author to the full inquest as his evidence was by now \"so peripheral\", but \"it does spark me to inquire into the history\".\nHe said

trainees to graduate from the scheme.\nIn another answer, schools minister Nick Gibb said a total of 551 applications had been received for the scheme which began training people in 2014.\nThis led to 41 individuals starting the programme in its first year.\nSince then 28 of the 29 who completed the programme had achieved qualified teacher status (QTS), he said.\nMs Powell said: \"I very much want to see more veterans re-training to become teachers as they have a huge amount to offer and we desperately need more good teachers.\n\"What's clear is that, as with the government's general slow response to teacher shortages, this scheme isn't working because the government isn't focusing on teacher recruitment.\n\"We urgently need a proper strategy for teacher recruitment, including of veterans for whom this could make a great second career.\"\nA Department for Education spokesman said: \"The 28 graduates referred to are the first trainees to be recruited and completed their

But total solar eclipses are special because they afford particularly favourable conditions to study the tenuous outer atmosphere of the Sun called the corona.\nIt is in this superheated \"gas\" of charged particles that the solar wind originates, and from which billions of tonnes of matter can occasionally burst towards the Earth to disrupt satellites, communications and even electricity grids.\nThe corona is outshone by the Sun's surface, its photosphere. And satellites will block out this glare using devices called  coronagraphs or occulters. But these are usually so wide that they also obstruct a doughnut of light immediately above the edge of the star.\n\"The spacecraft block out not only the Sun but also a whole lot of light around it, otherwise there would be scattering all over the image. And so we have that whole region uniquely to observe in white light from the ground at total solar eclipse,\" says Jay Pasachoff from Williams College, a veteran of 65 eclipses.\nAnd he wants members of the public to get in on the act.\nOne key project in the planning is the Citizen Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse (CATE) project run by the National Solar Observatory.\nIt is making available 59 identical telescopes and digital cameras to universities, schools and astronomy clubs along the path of the eclipse (another 40 observing kits are available to purchase).\nParticipants are being trained to gather images of the corona from their locality that can then be spliced together with everyone else's to produce an uninterrupted 90-minute video.\nCitizen CATE will rely on dedicated, calibrated equipment. But a similar venture plans to make use of the countless photos that will be taken on the day with general pocket cameras and smartphones.\nThe Eclipse Mega Movie Project is supported by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and a number of colleges, observatories, and corporations.\nThe initiative has a core band of photographers, but the public will be able to participate with the aid of an app that will offer advice on getting the best image quality and provide the means to upload pictures.\u00a0\nThe 21 August event is the first coast-to-coast total solar eclipse in the US since 1918.\u00a0\nThe Moon's shadow begins its journey across Earth's surface - the path of totality - out in the Pacific.\u00a0\nIt makes landfall near Newport in Oregon at 10:16 local time (17:16 GMT; 18:16 BST); and leaves the continent close to the Atlantic coastal city of Charleston, South Carolina, at 14:49 local time (18:49 GMT; 19:49 BST).\u00a0\nThe location that will experience full darkness for the \"greatest duration\" is just outside the town of Carbondale, Illinois.\u00a0Totality there will last 2 minutes and 40.2 seconds.\nSo many people are expected to try to view the eclipse that the American Astronomical Society has set up a taskforce to advise urban and rural communities on how to prepare for the expected population surge.\nProf Nordgren works a lot with the National Parks Service: \"I'm going to be at John Day Fossil Beds National Monument in eastern Oregon.\n\"They have six parking spaces and a porta-potty, and yet they're expecting maybe 20,000 people to come there on that day.\"\nAnd taskforce colleague, Angela Speck from the University of Missouri, added: \"We need to have communities ready for the influx of people that are coming, and that means things like emergency services, road traffic control, food and water.

Which, if you remember from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, was 42.\nHowever, I invite you today - as I have been comparably invited - to consider the good people of Helensburgh and the delight they take in swimming.\nWhy, I hear you ask, not unreasonably? Because the fair burgh on the Clyde got five million quid in the 2016 UK Budget to spend on a pool.\nAnd? And it wasn't part of the Barnett formula in any way. It was cash on the nail, for lanes and diving boards and the like.\nThis matters how? Because it proves, according to the UK government, that money may be allocated outwith Barnett - just as in the case of the \u00c2\u00a31bn going to Northern Ireland as part of the confidence and supply deal with the DUP.\nTold you it was a stretch.\nStill, let us give it a run (or, in the case of Helenburgh, let us take the plunge). Let us consider, dispassionately, as always, the competing arguments.\nFirstly, the formula named after Joel Barnett does not generally draw comparisons between Scotland and the other devolved territories of the UK.\nIt predicates a sum spent upon government departments in England and applies two factors. The comparability factor - that is, the extent to which the English spending compares with demands placed upon a devolved administration.\nAnd the population factor - a sum which calculates the relative numbers of citizens in England, Scotland etc.\nSo, strictly, the cash for NI does not, of itself, instantly demand Barnett comparability.\nThen two other points. The Barnett formula is non-statutory. Its rules are by convention and agreement. Its rules are, ultimately, what the Treasury say they are.\nAnd there has been formula bypass in the past. I refer my honourable friends to the topic of the Helensburgh swimming pool, no doubt to be a source of joy and delight to the residents of John Logie Baird's birthplace. Plus City Deals and substantial cash for NI in the past.\nGood caveats all. Reasonable and arguable. Expect to hear them advanced in the coming days.\nHowever, there is a wee snag here. It was not the opposition parties who insisted, initially, upon the application of the Barnett formula in relation to any putative DUP deal. It was the Secretary of State. For Scotland.\nIn advance of today's deal, David Mundell said there were rules about funding in the UK. Clear rules. And, he added, if the funding fell within the scope of Barnett then cash should come to Scotland too.\nIndeed, he signalled that he would contest any deal which breached that position.\nPedants that they are, Mr Mundell's rivals now want to hold the Secretary of State to his word. They say he should join them - the Scottish and Welsh governments plus others - in demanding a wider distribution of cash.\nThe Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson says this is hypocrisy. That those critics know that formula bypass is feasible. That the deal is intended to ensure UK stability.\nAnd the line from the Scotland Office? I suspect they have had better days. But they insist that the Secretary of State was simply demanding clarity: that he wanted an upfront deal, rather than anything in any way underhand.\nIt is implied further that he may now be able to wield influence to secure future advantage for Scotland with the Treasury, citing today's controversy.\nSomehow, I cannot see Mr Mundell's critics buying that one. Carwyn Jones, the Welsh First Minister, calls the package \"an outrageous straight bung\".

and we're not in that right now - the process for regaining or retaining, depending on where we are in the Brexit process, EU membership.\n\"Now it may be that we have a phased approach to that by necessity.\"\nAsked whether that could mean Efta membership first and EU membership later, she said: \"It may be by necessity, even if we didn't want that.\"\nIt is supposed to be the Brexit election.\nYet in Scotland, on the campaign trail, you're more likely to hear talk of independence.\nOf the four parties in Scotland defending seats at Westminster, the one least likely to major on independence in this campaign is the SNP, even though it exists to achieve independence.\nThere's an obvious reason for that. Independence divides opinion and in any election the SNP wants to broaden its appeal beyond \"Yes\" voters.\nThis has worked successfully for the party in the past.\nIn 2015, the SNP positioned itself as the party best placed to \"stand up for Scotland's best interests\" at Westminster.\nIt secured its best ever election result, winning 50% of the vote, 5% above the level of support for independence in the 2014 referendum.\nIn this year's election, Nicola Sturgeon has also sought to redefine the mandate that she is seeking in this UK general election.\nIt is, she said, \"to demand a place for Scotland at the Brexit negotiating table and the inclusion of the case for our place in the single market in the negotiating remit\".\nThat is a \"more immediate priority\" than indyref2, Ms Sturgeon said.\nRead Glenn Campbell's full article here.\nJackson Carlaw, Scottish Conservative deputy leader, responded to Ms Sturgeon's words by describing her position on Europe as \"complete chaos\".\nHe said: \"She claims we must have a referendum on independence because we're leaving the EU.\n\"Now, in a cynical attempt to win back Leave voters who have deserted the SNP, she now refuses to say whether an independent Scotland would go back in.\n\"And her flirtation with EFTA would leave us with all the obligations but no voice in decision-making.\"\nLabour's Kezia Dugdale said: \"The reality is the Nationalists have quietly shifted away from a policy of immediate EU membership if Scotland leaves the UK.\n\"Nicola Sturgeon claims Scotland must leave the UK because of Brexit, but won't even commit to rejoining the EU straight away.\"\nThe Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, Willie Rennie, accused Nicola Sturgeon of \"selling out pro Europeans\" to win back Brexit supporters.\nHe added: \"The SNP are using the EU as their excuse to call another independence vote but won't guarantee Scotland in the EU will be a result of their vote.\n\"For the SNP it is always about independence. The EU and a vote on the terms of Brexit are the latest excuses.\"", "McKee said attending a youth drama group in her home town of Peterlee, County Durham, \"changed my life\".\n\"Particularly in today's climate of austerity, it deeply concerns me that this kind of work must continue to be funded,\" she said.\nShe was speaking at the launch of a 15-year cultural strategy for the region.\nTitled The Case For Culture, it aims to get 500,000 more people - including 285,000 more children - involved in the arts in the north-east by 2030.\nIt also hopes to increase investment in the arts in the area from \u00c2\u00a3100m to \u00c2\u00a3300m over the next five years.\nThe strategy has been co-ordinated by Ros Rigby, who now works at the Sage concert hall in Gateshead - but who organised the Peterlee Youth Drama Workshop when McKee was a member in the late 1970s.\nMcKee said: \"I had no idea what a youth drama workshop was.

It will examine a range of options, including the case for linking benefit entitlements to the take-up of appropriate treatment.\n\"It will be important to identify the most cost effective treatments and programmes both here and internationally; and how employment support services, health care, and the benefits system, interact to provide support,\" she said.\nWhile support and treatment would continue to be provided for everyone, Mr Cameron said the system had to look at what to do when addicts simply refused help and expected taxpayers to continue funding their benefits.\nBut Sarah Wollaston, the Conservative chair of the Commons Health Select Committee and a former GP, said the government must proceed with caution if it wanted to directly link welfare payments to medical treatment.\n\"It is a form of coercion for consent,\" she told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Show.\n\"I think that is ethically unacceptable. I think it would be very difficult for any doctor to take part in treating a patient without valid consent and this would invalidate their consent if it was linked to conditionality to benefits.

France offered almost nothing despite their numerical advantage, while two first-half missed penalties from James Hook were also critical in the final analysis.\nWith a heavy rainstorm hitting Eden Park just before kick-off both sides struggled to control the ball in the early stages, spilling possession deep in each other's 22m.\nBut it was Wales who got on the board first when Hook landed a beautifully-judged penalty from the right touchline after France captain Thierry Dusautoir had gone offside at a ruck, although the departure through injury of tight-head Adam Jones - replaced by Paul James - quietened the noisy Celts in the crowd.\nHook then missed a far straighter penalty from 40m after his standing foot slipped, but Wales then set up camp deep in the French half, Roberts smashing through the defensive line only to hit Jonathan Davies in the face with a pass that could have put his fellow centre in.\nThe game then turned on a hugely controversial call from referee Alain Rolland. Warburton, so impressive throughout the tournament, lifted Vincent Clerc off his feet with a big hit and then turned him in the air, leaving the Frenchman crashing onto his back.\nWe just feel like the destiny of the result was taken out of our hands with the red card\nRead more Wales reaction\nRolland had no hesitation in pulling out his red card, stunning both Warburton and the crowd, but from the stands the tackle looked more misjudgement than malicious - a yellow card and no more at such an early stage of such a big contest.\nParra's subsequent penalty levelled the scores, and it then took desperate Welsh defence to keep out first Jean-Baptiste Poux and then Maxime Mermoz.\nHook had another chance from distance but again missed to the right, Parra nailing a simpler penalty from 35m to put Les Bleus 6-3 up with the interval approaching.\nSomehow Wales were still pressing, the outstanding Toby Faletau battering off a scrum to set up good field position only for Hook to mis-hit his attempted drop-goal under pressure.\nThe red card had sucked all the life and passion from the capacity ground, and as both sides restricted themselves to kicking for territory after the break the atmosphere remained curiously flat.\nWales coach Warren Gatland opted to replace the disappointing Hook with the 102-cap experience of Stephen Jones after 45 minutes as his side sought to get some sort of grip on the game.\nFrance, their forwards keeping it tight, began to put the denuded Welsh defence under increasing pressure. Relentless tackling protected the try-line but when a rolling maul from a line-out was taken down, Parra popped over a simple penalty for 9-3.\nWales were pinned deep in their own half, forced to kick away any possession, and with 25 minutes left it was hard to see any way back for them.\nThen Phillips, just as he had against Ireland in the quarter-final, took the match by the scruff of the neck.\nAfter powerful rumbles from his forwards, the scrum-half spotted a gap between the two French locks and accelerated through and away for the first try of the match.\nJones had the chance to put Wales in an unlikely lead but missed the straightforward conversion to leave it 8-9 going into a tumultuous final quarter.\nMost close-fought contests have their fair share of almosts and nearlys.

Mr Musharraf left the country in 2008 under the shadow of impeachment after losing power in elections.\nDuring his time in self-imposed exile in London and Dubai, the former president is believed to have earned hundreds of thousands of dollars on worldwide lecture tours.

a rarity in Pakistan - became much more commonplace.\nHis time in power was also marked by struggles with the judiciary, including an attempt to remove the chief justice and protracted disputes over his oft-stated desire to remain head of the army while simultaneously being president of Pakistan.\nThe president was often described as walking a tightrope as he has sought to balance pressure from the US to crack down on extremism in Pakistan and the demands from an increasingly vocal and anti-American Islamist constituency.\nRelations with India, meanwhile, worsened in 2001 after militants allegedly based in Pakistan attacked the Indian parliament.\nBy the summer of 2002 the two countries appeared to be on the brink of war with more than a million troops massed along both sides of the Line of Control that divides the disputed territory of Kashmir.\nThen Afghanistan began to loom large.\nMr Musharraf was frequently accused by Nato and the Afghan government of not doing enough to stem the movement of militants sympathetic to al-Qaeda and the Taliban from Pakistan's tribal areas into Afghanistan.\nAt one point some in the West even questioned Mr Musharraf's usefulness in the \"war on terror\", strongly criticising his policy of signing local peace agreements with militants in the north-west of the country.\nHis constant refrain was that he was the first Pakistani leader to target al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Pakistan's history.\nHe also fought nationalists in the province of Balochistan and had to deal with increased sectarian violence between hardline Sunni and Shia groups.\nInitially, he oversaw an improvement in economic growth, but in the latter part of his time in power Pakistan's finances were not considered to be especially healthy.\nAt the same time he faced an increasing number of challenges on the domestic front, culminating with the return of one of his main political enemies, Nawaz Sharif, to Pakistan from exile in 2007.\nIt marked the beginning of the end of his time in power.\nThe tables have now turned -

But what is it that the fans love so much?\nMusical theatre superfan Keith Milward, from Swansea, says it's that tale of romance that got him hook, line and sinker.\n\"It's such a great story. It has just got everything you want and even across the generations people have always responded to the loveliness of it.\"\nThe seemingly innocent and wholesome plotline sees young nun Maria sent out of her convent to be the governess of the seven cute von Trapp children.\nA few Do-Re-Mis later and Maria and the children's navy captain father, played by Christopher Plummer, have fallen in love. But then they have to flee the Nazis during the annexation of Austria.\nSo far, so gloriously far-fetched, you might think. But actually the story was based on the memoir of the real-life Maria von Trapp. Published in 1949, the book was later turned into a stage musical by Rodgers and Hammerstein before the film came along in 1965.\nYou would think even the hardest of souls would be softened by such a hefty dose of syrupy sentimentality but reviews at the time were lukewarm.\nCritics were keen to point out the historical inaccuracies of the film, claiming it glossed over Austria's role in World War Two. One eminent critic, Pauline Kael, condemned it as a \"sugar-coated lie that people seem to want to eat\".\nSource: IMDB / Official Charts\nBut current film critic Richard Fitzwilliam says audiences completely disagreed.\n\"There was just something so romantic about it. Musical films were really taking off and people liked seeing them on the wide-screen. It was completely different to the swords and sandals epics that were also popular at the time but it was just pure escapism. It was also perfect for families to watch together.\n\"Some said it was too schmaltzy and sentimental but it was hugely successful.\"\nSo while the film might score few points for factual accuracy, it's not the nuances of the plotline that has kept fans entertained for over five decades. It's the songs.\nThe Sound of Music soundtrack album was the UK's best-selling LP, not just in 1965, but in 1966 and 1968.\n\"They are just so infuriatingly hummable,\" Richard Fitzwilliam says. \"Just talking about the film,  I can hear the songs like the Lonely Goatherd, Sixteen Going on Seventeen and I'm tapping along and mumbling the lyrics.\"\n\"It's like a test,\" Keith Milward says. \"You can say to anyone in the street 'Do a deer, a female deer' and they'd know the tune and respond with the next line.\n\"Even the most cynical will be swayed once they hear the music. I saw a touring production of it at the Swansea Grand just a couple of weeks ago and everyone was singing along.\n\"The BBC even said that, should the end of the world be on its way, they would play the Sound of Music, so they must have thought it would brighten even the darkest of days.\"\nAnd it seems that might be true... to some extent. It is believed that, at the height of Cold War paranoia, the film was selected by TV executives to be broadcast as part of a series of recorded programming in the event of a nuclear strike.\nIn 2006, the master of the musicals, Lord Lloyd-Webber, brought the story right back into the popularity stakes with a TV contest to find an undiscovered performer to play Maria in a new West End production.\nMeanwhile, a sing-a-long version of the film still attracts hundreds of people every month. At the Prince Charles Cinema in London, fans turn up dressed as nuns and von Trapp children ready to sing their hearts out.\nMany fans hope the original film won't be subjected to a Hollywood remake.  \"It shouldn't be touched,\" Fitzwilliam says. \"There are so many enduring memories that come with it and the original is still so good.\"\nSo good indeed that last year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the cult classic, Lady Gaga took to the stage at the Oscar's to belt out a Sound of Music medley.\nFor those still not convinced, you may be pleased to hear that actor Christopher Plummer was for many years unimpressed by the film that he became well-known for, famously referring to it as the \"Sound of Mucus\". But despite his misgivings, even he can understand its enduring appeal.\nLast year he told Vanity Fair magazine: \"As cynical as I always was about The Sound of Music, I do respect that it is a bit of relief from all the gunfire and car chases you see these days.\n\"It's sort of wonderfully, old-fashionedly universal. It's got the bad guys and the Alps; it's got Julie and sentiment in bucketloads. Our director, dear old Bob Wise, did keep it from falling over the edge into a sea of treacle.\"", "The woman's bones, including a skull and teeth, were discovered at Achavanich in Caithness in 1987.\nUnusually, she was buried in a pit dug into solid rock and her skull is an abnormal shape which some suggest was done deliberately using bindings.\nMaya Hoole believes advances in technology could reveal more about the remains known as \"Ava\".\nSince the discovery and archaeological dig almost 30 years ago, plans of the site that were drawn by local authority archaeologists have been lost. Ms Hoole believes Ava's story has become largely forgotten.\nThe archaeologist has set up a website dedicated to new research on the bones, a decorated beaker buried with the woman and the Middle Bronze Age burial site, which lies close to the A9 between Latheron and Thurso.\nTests already done on the remains suggest the woman was aged 18 to 22 when she died.\nShe was buried in an unmarked rock-cut pit rather than underneath a cairn or in a pit dug into soil, which are the most commonly discovered burial sites from the Bronze Age.\nMs Hoole said she was only aware of a handful of other pits dug into solid rock that have been found in Scotland.\nShe said: \"A lot of time and energy was invested in this burial.\n\"It just makes you wonder - why go to all that effort? What was so unique about the individual buried here to receive such special treatment?\"\nThe decoration on the beaker found with Ava appears to be unique, the archaeologist said.\nShe said: \"I've looked far and wide for comparable examples, but there's nothing else out there quite like it, again making this burial significant.\n\"I have closely examined the beaker decoration and discovered that at least three different tools were used to create the design, likely meaning that the artist had a specially-made tool kit and was prepared and likely experienced.\"\nMs Hoole added: \"Like many others, I'm sure, I find skeletal remains completely mesmerising.\n\"The evidence shows that this was a young female, aged between 18 and 22, but we have no evidence of cause of death.\nSince she was discovered in the 1980s we have made great advances in technology and it makes you wonder what we could still learn from her. I've been working on recreating the lost site plans, and interpreting the position this individual was buried in.\n\"My interpretation suggests that the layout of the burial fits into a much wider trend extending as far south as North Yorkshire, and possibly much further beyond.\"\nWhat is known about Ava is that she was part of a much wider European group known as the Beaker people.\nShort and round skull shapes were common amongst this group, but Ms Hoole said the Achavanich specimen is exaggerated and of an abnormal, uneven shape.\nThe archaeologist said: \"There has been much debate amongst the archaeological community for many decades about the shape. Some argue it is a hereditary trait, whilst others think there may have been a practice of head-binding which creates the distinct shape.\n\"Perhaps this site can contribute more to the debate if further research is undertaken.\"\nShe added: \"She has been fondly nicknamed 'Ava', an abbreviation of the place she was found.\n\"Although potentially a controversial decision, I want people to remember that this is not just a cluster of bones, but that she was once a human being, with a name, an identity and a place in a long lost community.\"", "The new deal means the 30-year-old full-back will remain in Inverness until the summer of 2017.\nTremarco joined the Highlanders in July 2013 after spells at Tranmere Rovers, Wrexham, Darlington and Macclesfield.\n\"Carl is a great player with a great attitude and it's good to get him signed up for another year,\" said Caley Thistle manager John Hughes.\n\"There's other players who we've also made offers to and hopefully we can get some more sorted soon.\"", "A concerned neighbour called police to report domestic violence.\nPolice officers who arrived at the property also heard screaming coming from inside.\nWhen they tried to break in, the man, wearing headphones, came to the door.\nIt happened on Tuesday in Buitenveldert, a southern area of Amsterdam.\nPolice released details of the incident in a Facebook post.

But the simple fact is the Hearts strikeforce are not scoring enough goals - Sammon and Watt only have one goal each this season.\nThat struggle may last a little longer with winger Sam Nicholson ruled out for three months after going under the knife to fix a knee problem, but Faycal Rherras, who was taken to hospital in Morocco after falling ill on international duty, should return to training next week.\nWatt was replaced before the hour, with Robbie Muirhead given his chance. Sammon ploughed on until he was replaced by Bjorn Johnson, who scored the late goal that sealed the win.\nIt is strange that right-back Paterson is the biggest goal threat.

He also put a header wide of the post.\nThere were sporadic flashes from Faissal El Bakhtaoui, who won the free-kick from which Tom Hateley grazed the bar. It was probably always going to take time for El Bakhtaoui to make the step up, and he is not there yet.\nDundee, to their great credit, hit the woodwork four times - Hateley twice, Teijsse and Gadzhalov once.\nIf you are struggling to score goals, you can at least tighten up at the back. Dundee started with a back three which at times was more of a back five.\nOverall Dundee looked pretty solid, until Hearts finally found a way through.

Leaving Europe would have a profound impact on our economy for generations to come, so I refuse to accept that British business should be a silent partner in this debate.\"\nCBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said: \"The majority of CBI members want the UK to be in a reformed EU - changing it for the better, not just for the UK but for all member states... there are several areas where the EU needs to raise its game. Businesses want to see more trade deals, completion of the single market and less red tape.\"\nThe Institute of Directors urged businesses not to \"bury their heads in the sand\" over the EU referendum and had \"a duty to their shareholders, employees and customers to be discussing the implications of the vote at the most senior levels\".\nReferendum timeline: What will happen when?\nGuide: All you need to know about the referendum\nQ&A: What does Britain want from Europe?\nMore: BBC News EU referendum special", "The Lionhearts, beaten in last year's final by Cuba, went down 3-2 in Rome.\nFlyweight Galal Yafai beat Federico Serra and Dalton Smith defeated light-welterweight Paolo di Lernia.\nBut there were defeats for Jack Bateson, Josip-Bepo Filipi and Luka Plantic as all the bouts went to points.\nBantamweight Bateson was beaten by Francesco Maietta, Plantic lost his middleweight clash with Salvatore Cavallaro and heavyweight Filipi was outpointed by London 2012 Olympic silver medallist Clemente Russo.", "The 29-year-old, who is currently in Rio hosting coverage of the Olympic Games, said he was \"a huge fan\" of the show and \"cannot wait to get started\".\n\"I'm still waiting for someone to wake me up and tell me I'm dreaming!

The Senate investigated and in April 1974 President Nixon released edited tapes of his conversations about Watergate. In July the Supreme Court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes and the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee approved impeachment.\nIn August, Nixon admitted he had been aware of the cover-up and had tried to halt the FBI's inquiry. Four days later, he became the only US president to resign.\nBut are there really parallels between the Trump administration's alleged links to Russia and what happened 45 years ago?\nOne similarity is that the DNC, the target of the Watergate break-in, was also targeted in last year's US election campaign, when emails were stolen and leaked.\nUS intelligence agencies say Russia was behind the DNC hack, though Russia denies any involvement.\nRussia is believed to have wanted Mr Trump to win the election. An unverified report apparently compiled by a private intelligence firm claimed Russia had compromising information on Mr Trump and was in a position to blackmail him.\nSome commentators - including former President George W Bush's ethics lawyer Richard Painter - now fear the Russian connection could make Watergate seem trivial.\n\"The facts now in this investigation are much worse than the facts in the early stages of Watergate, which was a simple break-in ordered by mid-level campaign officials - not by the president,\" Mr Painter told Vox.\n\"Here we have facts that are much worse: We have a foreign power that has orchestrated a break in. It's a much worse situation than the outset of Watergate.\"\nThe alleged falsehood told by Mr Sessions has also fired up Watergate comparisons.\nOne of Mr Nixon's attorney generals, John Mitchell, was later jailed for offences including perjury for his role in the scandal.\nHis replacement Richard Kleindienst was not implicated in Watergate but pleaded guilty in 1974 to failing to testify fully to the Senate about favouritism shown to a communications company during his confirmation hearing.\n\"It's pretty clear listening to his testimony that [Sessions] certainly wasn't truthful when he was before the Senate and I don't think that's simply going to disappear because he's recused himself from partaking in any of the investigation as attorney general. That's going to continue,\" Mr Dean said.\n\"These eerie echoes of Watergate keep coming,\" he added.\nMr Sessions is now facing calls for him to quit over his recently-admitted contact with Sergei Kislyak - the same Russian official whose phone calls with Mr Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn led to Mr Flynn's resignation last month.\nMr Flynn's exit prompted veteran journalist Dan Rather to say on Facebook: \"Watergate is the biggest political scandal of my lifetime, until maybe now.\"\nIt is alleged that Mr Flynn discussed diplomatic issues with Mr Kislyak before assuming his role at the White House. It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy.\nSome commentators are now calling for a Watergate-style bipartisan Senate select committee to investigate links between Mr Trump's administration and Russia.\n\"I would immediately get a special prosecutor on the case,\" said Mr Dean.\nMr Trump's January dismissal of the previous attorney general Sally Yates also led to comparison's with Nixon's infamous \"Saturday night massacre\" during Watergate in 1973, when he fired an independent special prosecutor, triggering the resignations of attorney general Elliot Richardson and his deputy Gen William Ruckelshouse.\nNixon and Mr Trump are believed to be the only US presidents to have dismissed an attorney general.", "Paignton Zoo said treating the three-month-old male calf would have been prolonged and stressful.\nThe condition - discospondylitis -  is usually caused by infection and, even after treatment, the giraffe would have had a \"potentially painful neck\".\nPaignton Zoo said it was a difficult decision, but the right thing to do.\nThe giraffe, which was born in May and had not been named, had been bottle fed by zoo staff after it was rejected by its mother.\nIt was hoped concern about its neck would resolve as the calf grew, but it became more apparent over the past two weeks.\n\u2022The species is identified by its broader dividing white lines and no spots beneath the knees\n\u2022Classed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature\n\u2022Native to Kenya, Uganda and Sudan\n\u2022In the past, giraffes were hunted for their tails, which were used as good-luck charms, sewing thread and even fly swats\nCurator of Mammals, Neil Bemment, said the giraffe had been resting his head on the zoo fence so had been put on painkillers \"as a precaution\" while  X-rays were arranged.\n\"He'd started to develop a distinct kink in his neck and X-rays showed that at least two of his vertebrae joints were collapsing,\" Mr Bemment said.\n\"Treatment would be prolonged and stressful and he would still be left with a bent and potentially painful neck which would become accentuated as he got older and his neck grew proportionally longer.\"\nRothschild's are one of the most endangered species of giraffes, with only a few hundred left in the wild.\nIn June last year, a one-month-old Rothschild's calf was put to sleep after keepers found it collapsed in its stall.\nThe zoo said although discospondylitis is a known condition, it is not common and it is the first instance of it at Paignton Zoo.", "Mr Hammond said the government would not \"lie down\" and would \"do whatever we have to do\" to remain competitive.\nHe had been asked by a German newspaper if the UK could become a \"tax haven\" by further lowering corporation tax.\nLabour's Jeremy Corbyn said his comments sounded like \"a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe\".\nHaving so far refused to offer a \"running commentary\" on her plans, Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to spell out the most detail so far of her Brexit strategy in a speech on Tuesday.\nReports have suggested she will signal pulling out of the EU single market and customs union, although Downing Street described this as \"speculation\".\nIn an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Mr Hammond said he was \"optimistic\" a reciprocal deal on market access could be struck, and that he hoped the UK would \"remain in the mainstream of European economic and social thinking\".\n\"But if we are forced to be something different, then we will have to become something different,\" he said.\n\"If we have no access to the European market, if we are closed off, if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement on market access, then we could suffer from economic damage at least in the short-term.\n\"In this case, we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness. And you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do.\n\"The British people are not going to lie down and say, too bad, we've been wounded. We will change our model, and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged.\"\nAsked about Mr Hammond's comments during an interview on The Andrew Marr Show Mr Corbyn said \"He appears to be making a sort of threat to EU community saying 'well, if you don't give us exactly what we want, we are going to become this sort of strange entity on shore of Europe where there'll be very low levels of corporate taxation, and designed to undermine the effectiveness or otherwise of industry across Europe.'\n\"It seems to me a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future. That really isn't a very sensible way forward.\"\nMr Corbyn also said Mrs May \"appears to be heading us in the direction of a sort of bargain basement economy\", adding: \"It seems to me an extremely risky strategy.\"\nby BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam\nAccording to Philip Hammond, Britain might be \"forced\" to change its economic model. To what?\nFor some, the true advantage of leaving the EU would be to tear up the 'rules' and make Britain more like Singapore.\nSingapore abides by World Trade Organisation and ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) trade rules, but it's famed for its light touch regulation - especially when it comes to financial services - which some Brexiteers feel is the opposite of EU \"meddling\".\nBut turning a large G7 economy with a robust social model into a city state might be difficult. It might involve the government handpicking which industries it thinks will be successes and rapidly neglecting existing sectors.\nMillions of people would need to get brand new qualifications while those with undesirable skills would become surplus to requirements. Massive infrastructure projects might be rushed through with minimal consultation.\nFor a country with Britain's past and present, is that a possible future?\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it appeared Brexit would mean a \"low-tax, deregulated race to the bottom\", with workers' rights and environmental protections threatened.\nShe wrote on Twitter: \"If that is the case, it raises a more fundamental question - not just are we in/out EU, but what kind of country do we want to be?\"\nIn her speech on Tuesday, the prime minister is expected to call on the country to \"put an end to the division\" created by the EU referendum result.\nShe will urge the UK to leave behind words such as \"Leaver and Remainer and all the accompanying insults and unite to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain\".\nSeveral of Sunday's newspapers claim Mrs May will outline a \"hard Brexit\" approach, a term used to imply prioritising migration controls over single market access.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not think it was a \"binary choice\" between trade and migration, but added that the \"very stark message\" from the EU referendum was that \"free movement as it exists today cannot continue in to the future\".\nSpeaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said a \"hard Brexit\" had not been on the ballot paper in June's referendum and accused the PM of adopting \"the Nigel Farage vision\" of Brexit.\nMr Farage, the former UKIP leader, told Sky News he had \"yet to be convinced\" by the PM's approach.", "The loan window for Football League clubs opened seven days later, while any club can sign unattached players if they left their old clubs before the deadline.\nBiggest signing in the

reduce smoking rates.\nIt added it also compromised current tobacco control measures such as age-of-sale legislation, labelling and the ban on having tobacco on display in shops.\nMr Drakeford said: \"I am very concerned about illegal tobacco because its affordability and availability threatens the health of children, making it so much easier for them to access tobacco. It also eliminates the price incentive for smokers to quit the habit.\n\"This is not a Robin Hood crime. It is criminality which deprives the public of vital revenue which is used to fund essential public and health services, including tackling the damaging impacts of tobacco itself but its effects extend far beyond that.\"\nMatthew Cridland, chairman of the Wales heads of trading standards, said figures showed 15% of tobacco used in Wales was illegal - the equivalent of one million cigarettes being smoked a day.\n\"We want to work with all tobacco control partners to address not only supply but also demand for illegal tobacco and trading standards will continue to vigorously pursue all those who distribute and supply this product,\" he added.", "It was due to be set up in February.\nResponding to a question from the UUP leader, Mike Nesbitt, Ms O'Neill told MLAs that the terms of reference for the group had been drafted but \"have not been formally signed off\".\nShe said this meant consequently that the group has not yet met.\nThe group was proposed in February when First Minister Arlene Foster asked then health minister Simon Hamilton to set up a working group to look at how the issue of fatal foetal abnormality could be addressed.\nIt was initially due to report back by the end of June.\nThe minister told the Assembly she was giving the matter \"careful consideration\", adding: \"I am meeting the justice minister in the next number of weeks and I intend to discuss how we take the issue forward.\"\nThe minister also said she was meeting Sarah Ewart, who brought the issue of fatal foetal abnormality to the public's attention after her own personal experience of abortion..\nOn Monday, an appeal began against a High Court ruling that abortion law in Northern Ireland is \"incompatible\" with human rights law.\nThe appeal has been taken by the Department of Justice and Northern Ireland Attorney General John Larkin.\nIn December, a judge ruled the law did not comply with the European Convention on Human Rights in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or sexual crime.\nThat case was brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission.\nHowever, the justice department believes the ruling by the High Court could lead to a widening of the abortion law.\nThe current abortion legislation differs from the rest of the UK as the Abortion Act 1967 was never extended to Northern Ireland.\nCurrently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk, or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.", "Michelle Meloitte, 61, of Bannagh Beg Road in Kesh, appeared in court after admitting fraud by abuse of her role.\nA prosecution barrister said Meloitte \"dishonestly exploited\" an elderly patient whom she had asked for a loan.\nHe added that she chose not to repay it until her conduct was investigated.\nMeloitte, who has since repaid the money, will be sentenced next month.\nOmagh Crown Court, sitting in Dungannon, County Tyrone, heard that the victim, Michael McGrory, was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and Meloitte was aware of his condition when she approached him in February 2010 \"to ask him for a favour\".\nHe agreed to sign a cheque in the presence of his home carer with a guarantee it would be paid back in the summer of that year.\nThe carer confronted Meloitte a year later when the money was not repaid, but the doctor told her \"not to worry about it\".\nThe money was returned when police began an inquiry.\nMr McGrory died in 2012 and a defence lawyer said there had been no financial loss to him or his estate.\nMeloitte's reputation was now \"besmirched\", he added, and she had not practiced as a GP for the last five years.\nThe judge adjourned sentencing until 4 April.\nThe General Medical Council will decide whether to remove the doctor from the medical register at a hearing on 18 May.", "Both Yahoo Mail and Gmail are named in the 30 April email, published on Thursday by Gizmodo, saying the attacks had increased \"in the past 48 hours\".\nYahoo Mail will be blocked \"until further notice\" it adds.\nRansomware encrypts victims' files and demands a ransom be paid for unlocking.\nMeanwhile, an unnamed House of Representatives employee has told Reuters devices connected to the internet via its wi-fi or ethernet cables have been barred from accessing appspot.com, the domain where Google hosts custom-built apps.\n\"We began blocking appspot.com on 3 May 3 in response to indicators that appspot.com was potentially still hosting a remote access Trojan named BLT that has been there since June 2015,\" the news agency was told.\nReuters' sources said the FBI had originally warned Congress of the potential vulnerabilities.\nFormer House of Representatives employee Ted Henderson told Reuters two Google-hosted apps he had created to allow members of Congress to discuss politics and share notifications about votes had been hit by the ban.\nBoth Yahoo and Google said they were working with Congress to resolve the issue.", "Rose, 24, has made 38 Premier League appearances for Spurs since joining from Leeds in 2007 and was part of the GB squad at the London 2012 Olympics.\nHe will compete with Ben Davies -

the Primary Stars scheme is the latest in a long line of community projects supported by football. \"The clubs have been doing all this for over 20 years,\" he said.\n\"They have huge involvement in their local communities, and yet the message never gets across.\"\nHowever, he stressed top-flight clubs are not seeking \"credit\" by getting involved in the project.\nPremier League Primary Stars will provide free resources linked to the national curriculum to boys and girls aged five to 11.\nAfter the initial reach, Scudamore says he hopes the scheme will extend to every primary school in England and Wales by 2022.\nThe initiative will supply free to download lesson plans, activities and video content in Maths, English, Physical Education (PE) and Personal, Social, Health and Economic education (PSHE).\nScudamore added that schools located close to professional football teams could also benefit from club coaches coming into schools to assist with PE lessons.\nThe programme aims to use the appeal of Premier League clubs \"to inspire children to learn, be active and develop important life skills\" - an impact Scudamore says the clubs already see in their involvement in community projects.\n\"We do an awful lot of this anyway - the clubs have been doing a lot of work in communities, a lot of our clubs are involved in schools, not just Premier League clubs but English Football League clubs too,\" he said.\n\"Nobody out there really knows -

if we trusted him, and it worked both ways, then the chances were there that we could become a professional footballer.\"\nMr Radford also described a sexual assault which he said took place after he had developed a back injury and was asked to lie down for treatment.\nJamie Webb, who joined the club when he was 13, described how boys were \"groomed\" by the club employee who asked them to write him \"love\" letters.\nRecalling a \"definite attempt to abuse me\", Mr Webb said: \"I recall clearly he tried to move down and put his hand in between my shorts and my tracksuit that I was wearing and I just blocked him.\"\nHe said the experiences \"tarnished\" his memories of his time at the club and Mr Radford said he held the club \"partly responsible\" for the abuse.\nMr Radford said: \"They must have known, they must have heard these rumours going around because everybody else had.\"\nThe two men waived their anonymity to speak to the BBC.\nBBC South has also spoken to other former Southampton players who have come forward with allegations of abuse.\nMr Radford said he had the \"utmost respect\" for other ex-footballers who have spoken out about being abused.\nHe said: \"You don't live every day of your life crying your eyes out and walking around with your head down, you get on with life as normal, but you still have it there, it's buried there deep, and it comes up, and it will keep coming up for the rest of my life.\"\nMr Radford said if his parents had known at the time they would have stopped the abuse.\nHampshire Constabulary is one of 15 police forces investigating allegations of abuse in football.\nIt comes as the NSPCC said its hotline -

Some of the forwards were outstanding.\"\nThe hosts looked to be seriously up against it when Isa and Cordero scored either side of the break against 13 men after Daly's dismissal and a yellow for Dan Cole.\nJones' men dug in and managed to resist a tiring Argentina for the rest of the game. They even began to gain the upper hand in the scrum with Farrell kicking two further penalties before May ran in the corner after George Ford, Tom Wood and Jonathan Joseph drew tackles to release the Gloucester man.\nDespite the Daly red, it had looked like it would be a more straightforward victory when referee Pascal Gauzere awarded England a penalty try just before the half hour after Matias Orlando deliberately knocked forward a Chris Robshaw pass with Wood poised to score.\nA key passage of the match came at the end of the first half as Argentina's pack laid siege to the England line with the hosts forced to concede a succession of penalties.\nThe visitors decided to pass up the opportunity for an easy three points and opted for repeated scrums. As the penalties accumulated, England lost Billy Vunipola to injury and Cole to the sin-bin as Gauzere lost patience with the repeat offending.\nWith the half in its 48th minute, replacement flanker Isa eventually picked up and drove through scrum-half Ben Youngs to give Argentina a huge boost going into the belated break.\nHolding a two-man advantage, they went for the jugular at the start of the second half, moving the ball across the field to Estelles. The winger drew in Mike Brown on the left flank and quick passes sent Cordero clear under the posts.\nThe gap was suddenly down to two points and Jones' 100% winning record looked in danger, but the hosts dominated once Cole returned to the field.\n\"The way we adapted our tactics and coped with the problems was tremendous,\" said Jones. \"It is credit to our strength and conditioning staff to get the players to the level of fitness they showed in the last 20 minutes.\n\"I think we won the match before half-time. The way we held on with those scrums was superb. It was 15 men against 13 but we coped.\"\nThe match ended as it began with Gauzere showing another red card, this time to Argentina's Pieretto who stamped on fellow replacement Marler after the England prop held on to him.\nMarler was shown a yellow for his part in the incident.\nFormer England captain Lewis Moody on BBC Two\nGoing down to 14 men, England will be very happy to come out with a win. They did it in the end and had to absorb pressure but took the penalties that were on offer.\nEngland have been on a fantastic run and could end up equalling the team of 2002-2003. This group has so much building to do, there is so much more to come.\nThey will beat Australia next week, they are so confident and can take a lot out of this.\nEngland end their autumn campaign with the visit of Australia next Saturday (14:30 GMT), looking to make it four wins in four weeks.\n\"We are looking forward to Australia next week.
