{"document": ["Used this for Elite Dangerous on my mac, an amazing joystick. I especially love that you can twist the stick for different movement bindings as well as move it in the normal way. Great stick! Could use another few buttons but overall it is the best for the $. Love it. I purchased a T Flight for Elite Dangerous and to begin with loved it! But in less than 2 months the #5 button stopped working. It was Purchased from B&H Photo and they only have a 30 day return so I was left to the people at Thrustmaster. They made me do the same thing as in downloading custom drivers, video me trying the joystick out and showing both the stick and screen that its not being used. Then after 3 days they come back and say I should cut the USB cable and send them a picture of it before they will send me a replacement. This is horrible Customer Service. I will also never buy a Thrustmaster or anything from B&H again! I'm happy to say I have just put in an order for a Saitek X55 Rhino Pro and this time trough Amazon. Even with it though I sprung for the 2 year replacement plan for an extra $9. Seems worth the Money to avoid hassles like this in the future. Good stick combo at right price. It's a heap of plastic, but fine if you want something cheap.  Pretty much cheap is the only good thing about it and it will feel cheap when you use it.  The throttle is more like a switch, no force it's just click forward or click back.  The joystick felt nice, however.  The only real drawback is the throttle.  It will not give you that immersive feeling.  It will feel as if you simply flipped a switch. Awsome! Works really well for cheap. More than enough for what ever game you need it for. I ordered this to play Elite Dangerous and love it. The feel and movement are great. The only draw back was that it just needed a few more buttons but very happy with it.", "nice, but tend to slip away from stick in intense (hard pressed) gaming sessions. I like these out of the few that I have tried. Very close to stock height. Many other are to thick and create longer joysticks. These I enjoy. item worked but when my thumbs got sweaty it would slip just a little! If you're looking at these, chances are you would benefit from buying them. Are you a gamer with sweaty hands? Do you play seriously/competitively and need more granular control so you can pwn n00bz and howl &#34;HEADSHOT!&#34; loud enough to wake the baby? If the answer to either or both questions is &#34;yes,&#34; buy these and game on. If you only play occasionally, these still improve feel and control enough to be noticeable and well worth the price of admission. They may not make you a better gamer, but they'll make you a more comfortable one.I've been using them for nearly a year now and they completely solved the hand and wrist pain I used to get from my thumbs slipping around on the analog sticks during extended sessions (4+ hours). Compared to the cost of treating a repetitive strain injury, these things are basically free. As others have mentioned, the stock rubber covering on the PS4's analog sticks is also somewhat notorious for disintegrating, so these are a nice bit of insurance for your controllers and your body. Wow, these things r AWESOME!!! and they really help out alot. U instantly notice the difference. GREAT product. Also, u have 2 color choices. Hope the pic helps out. Enjoy!!! The heat is on! There's 20 seconds left of the match and you're a goal behind. You're sweating, maybe because it's been 4 hours, maybe because you don't have time to turn on the air conditioner. When every second counts you'll be happy you got these grips. I have full control of my dualshock 4 even with the edge of a finger. After over a year of frequent use, they don't show any signs of wear nor does the controller stick. Good investment if you are a winner, or a close second.", "Great amiibo, great for collecting. Quality material to be desired, since its not perfect. The detail on this was awesome. Recently they've been getting goofy faces and I lucked out and got one that looked fine Came on time. It is great perfect quality! So happy with the purchase!!! Awesome Received damaged package sent back for refund Arrived in perfect condition. Very happy. Totally worth paying a little more then retail to save me my time hunting for one. really surprising", "Does not fit properly. The cartridge will get stuck and will be a pain in the butt to get out! I don't think this company actually test this because if they did they would notice that the cartridge will be hard as hell to remove! My advice would be to try and refurbish the old 72 pin if possible. Don't waste your money like I did. Fixed my issue! Thanks!", "It did not fit the device well... Now i have to buy a better one. Sorry guys but its the truth. Used it to play the new resident evil and remote for my Ps4 and it does help a lot I went from getting no kills with the small analog sticks on the vita to being a good match. Take it from me I enjoy this project.", "perfect lightweight and works flawless with Xbox 360 It's an Xbox 360 media remote. It works as it should. Very useful. great Is a must have!Great deal! Cheap remote. Scratches easily", "great Couldn't be more happy!!!!", "Works beautifully and looks great. I love playing the slew of great rpgs for it. I had an issue with the seller! But!!! The Pikachu Edition 3DS XL works just fine, it's brand new, and it just looks awesome! Even though it was for another region, it still plays English (American Version) games and there were no English flaws, the system was made for all regions, it was just meant to be sold in the region mentioned. I love it, it looks great, great gift for kids or collectors.", "Kids loved the game.  They are 9 and 11. Got this for my Daughter she loves the game and I like the price and the face that it worked. 8 yo son just like it. He still grabs the other games rather than this one. My 6 year old son loves Mario, but got bored with this pretty fast.  It's also only 1 player.  I've not played it, I was just surprised he was not interested in it after a week. Simple and fun to play.", "very good This headset has awesome sound and is built very sturdy ....however it disconnects all the time from the dongle that is included with it and let me tell ya if you forget to turn the TV volume down and you are using this headset...when it disconnects ....the wife or GF does NOT like it very much at 3 am on a work night. The headsets are epic! I love how I don't depend on cables, the surround sound is the best. I really recommend this seller and these headsets. works great! awesome battery life! pretty comfortable. nice-looking.  wish it could be a bit louder though. also, on some streaming apps (hulu, amazon), the wireless audio spontaneously disconnects -- not sure why. It's ok. But for an official Playstation product I expected it to be a lot better. It cuts out randomly, and the sound isn't amazing. Haven't used the mic on it yet. The battery lasts pretty well. It's very bulky to wear.", "It contains the two best Kingdom Hearts games that can be replayed in beautiful hd. KH2 especially still holds up amazing. Brand new perfect condition and it even came a day early. Highly satisfied. great! and better than ps2! its still lacks the mouth talk sometimes like in ps2 but still great", "This game is legendary if you like RPG games and haven't played any of the fallout games BUY THIS GAME it's worth every cent I'm my opinion I think this is a little better than Skyrim and get Game of the Year edition its pretty cheap and actually worth your money The game is in excellent condition but it was supposed to be new but its not. Nothing better than a good Fallout game Best game ever! I found this game at a Vintage Stock that just opened up near me. I've gotten through a good deal of it so far and I'd say this is a great game! Graphics are great, game controls are fantastic and the story is pretty good as well. I do have to warn everyone though this isn't a game for wimps at heart. If you don't like violence and killing off enemies you might be better off playing candy crush or something. The game so far seems to reward you for being good and nice. It's really addictive and fun. I can play it for hours and not notice that maybe four or five hours went by. Easily one of my top favorite games. Reminds me of back when I was seven learning to play Sonic the hedgehog 2. Great game, but I bought this at gamestop for $9.99.  If you want a better deal just go to gamestop.  All and all loved it, and probably one of my favorite games of all time. Best game I have ever played hands down. It's immersive, huge, and is incredibly lax on freedom of choice compared to other games. If someone asks what game they should play, I would immediately recomend this one. An open world game where your actions decide the course of the future... Fallout 3 is probably one of the greatest games of all time. The pacing is perfect for any style of gamer that likes role playing games. You can find many hours of entertainment and replay ability with all of the choices that are presented during game play. The box includes the game one one disc and all the DLC on another disc, so its perfect for offline play. You can choose to install it to your hard drive and it takes around 2GB of open space for the DLC. You can easily get over 50 hours of entertainment from this game, which makes it well worth the money you spend on it. Shipped fast, fantastic quality.", "Normally I wouldn't bother rating anythng 1 star but Rockstar has made this thing very difficult, if not impossible to authenticate. The automatic autherntication does not work and the offline setup doesn't either. The super secret code it generates does nothing. You copy that to one window then type in the other super secret code that comes on the back of a book, hit authenticate or whatever and it terminates, saying you should make sure the unlock request is entered correctly. Well, yes you idiots, I know how to copy and paste. You cannot play even offline and you have to start all over again. There is a securerom link to go to if you can't get it working. It doesn't work either. It's so secure you can't access it. I do have the xbox version so I can play it but I prefer PC gaming.Maybe the steam version is the way to go. I haven't tried it and am not planning to buy the damn thing a third time but that might be the way to go instead of footling around with the disc version. I do not recommend wasting your time trying to get through Rockstar's DRM. Honestly you idiots, pirates will pirate. Regular users are the ones who get scred by DRM. When will you learn? Awesome! Great game but needs optimization on PCVery laggy even with great hardware!Otherwise amazing game and story telling!", "Was a gift and is loved and used by granddaughter. This game is amazing. They use the deck system like recoded but you do not have to use cards. Also a lot of new combos and spells. Best of all you get to play as Rikku as well and he is a monster in this game! The new traveling ability you get is really cool as well. Very versitile for easy chains on enemies in battle and for escape when needed, Love it to all of you kingdom hearts fans buy this it will be worth the wait and money. The game will show you a new  look and will also keep you entertained with new enemies and new companions with new support.to Great game, and I got it in good time.", "Nice... just like the oem one Works great...got a good deal on this. Came fast. Very cool One of the koolest game pads I've ever used Perfect Nice controller ok Love the controller camo, no different from the controllers that come with the console. So be careful with em'! My triggers are starting to get some wear on em' so I am worried if I drop it on either side it may break em'. Camo controller, what's not to like. Works great. The joysticks seems to be smoother than other I have. Might be all in my head or I might be lucky, I just think they might be made that way. My controller is working great. The info packet tells me to let it rest every 30 minutes but come on, really. Still works great after a few (like 2) hours of continuous game play. Doesn't get hot or glitchy. Great buy. Works great This controller did not even last me a year. i wore out the triggers with normal gameplay. Great product, Thanks. I like it, works great.... I was able to purchase this product cheaper on amazon while getting free prime shipping. Since this controller is made by sony, it works as good as the stock controller. I love the camouflage pattern of the controller!", "Downloaded this from the PSN before release date but played for about 5 hours last night.Don't expect resident evil style of game play...If you like Heavy Rain, Telltale games such as The Walking Dead & The wolf among us style of game play this is the game for you!!  Supped up graphics and good story line.  I really like the way the creators of the game switch between characters and leaves you in suspense right after an incident.  Really solid game so far! Update: Sept 11 2015. Really good game.  The only issue I have with this game is it should have been much longer....it's too short. LOVE LOVE LOVE this game! I've already beaten it once, but not enough of the characters survived, so now I'm playing through it again (this time with the help of a walkthrough!) Though one of them just died last night, I assume because of a decision I made earlier in the game. So now I'm going to start over yet again, following the guide word for word. It's an insanely fun game, though some of the QTE's can be tricky. Definitely recommended. A great game that could lay the benchmark for future interactive experiences.  Unfortunately it isn't as ambitious as it could be.  While I enjoyed my time and recommend it to others, the choices you make only affect what may or may not happen to a character, but not the overall story.  This was what I found to be disappointing.  Some main characters, no matter what decisions you make, will always be in the final chapter.  Only then can you decide if they live or die.  I won't necessarily say I felt deceived, but played instead.The game said I can choose who to save or let die.  While that's true, the game sells itself short by not letting players ultimately decide when and where it can necessarily happen.  The game uses a butterfly effect system that notifies players when future events have been altered by the choices they just made.  This system could have been more revolutionary if the game wasn't so restricted with its storytelling.The most simplest way I can explain this is that each character, besides the main ones, are being strung along for the ride.  They each have their particular moments for them and them alone.  It's the player's job to make sure they get there by not cutting the cord with the decisions they make or don't make at a designated time.  Ultimately, the game has a story to tell and will tell it regardless if you want to play along or not.This game and future games like it can improve by allowing some deviation from the main plot.  Even letting players choose the blue pill (Matrix reference).  If Neo takes it, there is no story or film.  For example, I wouldn't mind if I played the game in a way everyone died within the first couple of hours and it was game over.  Characters shouldn't have their set paths unless we can decide how they get there.  This is ultimately where I would like this genre to go.  If it doesn't, we're just being pulled along as well.eady been written by the choices you made prior.&#34;  You can see the pros and cons to this, but ultimately the decision made by the developers encourages more replay-ability.  Normally I would frown upon this, but the game isn't that long.  It's about 8-10 hours depending how much you explore.  It's split up in to chapters so a replay isn't much of a chore.  All you have to do is put up with the unskippable cutscenes, but the acting is well done and you can make certain changes to them with the choices you make.  All in all, this game was better than I thought.  I was expecting another The Order, but having an interactive experience with good characters in an overall fun story.  The game is definitely worth your time.  Controls leave more to be desired, but games like this are a good alternative to the norm and leave hope for more old school style Survival Horror games. This game is not a game changer but definitely a fun experience. This game will keep you as the player engaged from start to finish. As some games like this type lose steam towards the end, Until Dawn keeps steady from start to finish. I beat this twice in 24 hours just because I was drawn into the story.Very impressive with the graphics and the feel. Sometimes the frame rate is quirky in some spots but nothing noticeable to most casual players. While the camera angles do not adjust much, this adds to the appeal and creep factor this game has. Controls make sense as it makes your characters look and react with a sense of reality that applies to this game.The game play itself has a great balance of presenting the story but making sure you are ultimately in control. Tensions grow as you run through areas making sure anticipate your next action, but you cannot over commit as the command may change or speed up. Your choices matter for the most part and are hidden all throughout the game. You don't ALWAYS know what choice you make is that pivotal moment in a characters life and that makes it exciting.So why 4 stars? As much as I love it, I would not spend 60 dollars for this game. I feel its appeal is awesome but will fade after about the 3rd play through. While it would be nice to say I wish this game would be bigger, that's not the case. The design of the game itself just becomes self limiting at points. DLC would be great, but besides the bonus chapter for preorders, I doubt that will happen.In short, your first playthrough will be amazing and create an experience that you will remember for a long time however multiple playthroughs may diminish your overall return and you may question how far your 60 bucks went when compared to a title like the witcher 3 or metal gear solid v. I love this game.  This game delivers so much suspense on different levels.  Not only do you have to have quick reflexes to survive, you have to carefully consider the decisions you make.  The game seems like it can go a lot of different directions so the replay value is there.  Gorgeous graphics and great cut scenes.  I really enjoy the diversity in the characters and i found myself really caring what happens to each of them, all but one anyway.  The only thing that turned me off from the game at first was the wonky camera angles, but you get used to it and I think it does make things more cinematic and suspenseful at times.  All in all the Butterfly system, storyline, characters, and action sequences made up for the lack of control in camera viewpoints and character movement, so if this bugs you at first as it did me, give the game a chance. This game is really fun. It's basically an interactive story because each decision you make has a direct effect on things that happen later in the game. The controls feel a little off at times but this isn't much of a complaint because they work fine during action sequences. Graphics look good but not great. The story is the best part especially if you're an 80's horror fan. I was hesitant on buying it but I'm glad I chose to buy it. If your on the fence you will miss out if you don't get it. One of the best horror games I've played. I love the tension and the creepy atmosphere Until Dawn sets up for you. The jump scares are there, but the story and plot make the game so much creepier. In the game, your choices do matter, and if a character dies, it will continue, so think carefully! If you enjoyed Heavy Rain or The Tall Tale Walking Dead Games, I highly recommend this game. This is the best &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; game I've ever played. Awesome game better story. Only issue is that controls can be a pain. Sometimes characters get stuck on objects in the environment like in the old resident evil games. It's an amazing game if you can stand the qte's but that's fine since it is basically a horror movie that you make choices to determine who lives and who dies. Very fun for me and my friends to sit around and shout &#34;DO THIS!, NO DO THAT!&#34; even though it is a 1 player game. I bought it off PSN as a download but it's great and I love it! I'm alrady going through my second playthrough to make things happen differently I had so much fun playing this game.  It helps that I love horror, this game is a love letter to the genre, but it's fun for anyone who enjoys a good scare.  It's so interactive as well, my wife found herself getting sucked in to the story.  The characters are great, the story is great, and the scares are superb.  I seriously got immensely freaked out while playing this game.  It has some genuinely tense moments throughout and some major jump scares.  The butterfly dynamic is a blast and supports multiple playthroughs.  Resist the temptation to read too much about the choices and just go with your gut the first time through!  I love this game and I really hope it goes well.A+ to supermassive.  Please make more.Ps.  How about an inverted camera option though?  I know I'm a freak, but that'd be awesome!  Great, great game. One of the best horror games out there. This game is like a mix of heavy rain and saw and it looks AMAZING. the graphics are super good, the environment looks beautiful. And the fact that its a choose your own horror game makes it even more fun/scary to play because you dont know what will happen everytime you play. Almost every decision you make even a tiny one affects something later Excellent game A great entry into the interactive fiction genre on playstation. Like Heavy Rain before it, Until Dawn is a unique experience that I'd recommend anyone give a try. It's a healthy 10-12 hour length to complete, but it's filled with replayability as you can make new decisions that dramatically alter the narrative. Even if you aren't a huge horror fan, I say still give it a shot. From the atmospheric graphics and sound, to the multiple character driven narrative, I think the developer nailed what they set out to achieve. Fantastic Great game. Unlike The Walking Dead your choices actually matter. If you're a horror fan give it a shot. So I preordered this knowing it was going to be scary but was it what I expected? Not exactly. As the game begins the tension builds. 8 characters in a more like mansion then cabin but it's really cool and isolated. Yo u have the characters you can't stand with their cocky attitudes then the ones you really like. Sweet and pleasant. Once you are finally introduced to the next year's characters going to the cabin after the tragic accident the year before, in honor of them they return. The character are all introduced as who they really are, compassionate, smart or egotistical and cocky. Not it the males but females as well. Then you get on with the game and your in this freaky office that's with a psychiatrist , I think, that's if he's real. But he sort of guides you thru each chapter telling you what a shifty  job you've  done to date or good job. Then you get a recap before you move on. As you decide die the fate of each character , thinking your really are controlling it which is really not the case cause it's very unpredictable. It reminds me of the freaky dude from the SAW movie talking and giving you a choice, the psychiatrist is a actor I can't quite remember his mane but you'll no. So between. The saw movie and this guy it's kind cool. Your playing threw a movie that's all.not much action game play but very interesting. If I scared easily I'd have been honestly s a red but I don't so I wasn't. It is freaky and bloody. It's a cool game and I'm glad I preordered. I.played it almost from the middle Ute I put it in about 8 pm til 2 am then find pushed up in the am after about 2  more hrs. So you get about 8 to 9 hrs depending on you . The decisions aren't always easy and like I said not what they seem. The storyline is freaky and scary but good it's like playing threw a movie that you semi control.I see me playing this game multiple times trying to see what different outcomes I get.Yes it like watching a killer movie like Halloween and saying to the character 'hoe dumb are you ,he's going to find you' this time your making the the decisions and kicking yourself for making the wrong move.Basically the totems and the butterfly effect and you  are what controls the fate of all of them. So yes ill be 're listing this again and playing I t all in one sitting on those cold winter days when you don't wAnt to go outside.I'm one of those ppl who love action games so for me to like this is a biggie. I actually hated the walking dead games and this is sort of like knob e them control wise but way way better. So I think you'd love this game even if your like me and into the more action games.I'd wait for the price to lower cause I real k y don't think it's worth the cost right now but I don't regret buying it and . I also think. That depends on what kind of gamer you are.I was updating my system when this came and having upgrade problems so it sat there just n my face for 3 days while I finally got my system up and running again.

The overall game is a blast to play and the story makes you keep wanting more! The decisions you make DO affect the storyline! It's a must for any horror fan. This game is slow paced and just boring. If you like walking around with a flashlight for the majority of the time then you might find this game entertaining but I didn't. The graphics are good but that's about it. The choices you make are mostly quick-time events and are not very interesting. I am a huge fan of story based games like The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones and even the classic Heavy Rain but I just expected more from this one, disappointed. Nerve racking good fun! One of the prettiest games ever made, doesn't run as smooth as it could but they will patch that and fix It I'm sure.  Very interesting story ad almost interactive movie quality gameplay.  Must have for horror movie fans! This is a great game. I can't remember the last time that I played a game from start to finish in the same day until this game came along. Play time for me was roughly 9 hours, but I can see replaying this at least another play through. If you liked Heavy Rain, and survival horror games, this is a great combination of the two. This is a very good game, the twist towards the end was just brilliant. What is this crap? I did not buy a PS4 just to play interactive movies. I immediately sold this game and my PS4. I am done with Sony and am joining the Xbox master race. Dont look at some of the 1 star reviews, they contain spoilers and rate it badly for reasons like &#34; its too scary&#34; , its a horror movie. The gameplay in this is a lot like Heavy Rain. The story is decent, and it borrows a lot of from contemporary horror. I do wish some of the gameplay elements weren't QuickTime events, so I can only give this four stars. Still, the graphics are fantastic and its a fun ride once it gets going. I loved this game, it is very cinematic.  I played in on night until dawn because I could'nt stop! Amazing graphics, immersive story, scary moments, anxiety and decision making about how you want to progress. This game is on  the tradition Heavy Rain created. I hope more games like this will come out in the future!Highly recommended for all horror and mystery lovers. simply amazing.horror at its finest.BUY IT First off this is a REALLY good game. The first time you play through it everything is very tense and it's a great story based game which it very much worth playing. That being said there isn't as much replayability to the game as I had hoped. I've been through it 3 times just to make different choices and I'm not going to go into spoilers, but trust me, with the exception of a few key choices that you make the outcome of the game as much as everyone thought it would. However this is still a very good game but to go through it once without knowing anything about it will take you about 7 hours. It's a great game to play but I recommend renting instead of paying the full $60. This game is so great. So well developed, designed, and thought out. The butterfly affect is amazing, may not have the longest play through, but replayability is like no other. Super scary and tense. If you like being scared this is your game. If you love games like Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, Indigo Prophecy, The Walking Dead games then this is an instant buy for you!  Very good game. Just finished one full night of this game. Missed a ton of stuff (apparently) and got a couple people killed due to a toy from my son hitting the couch when I was to remain completely still and any SLIGHT movement meant death. This game is freaking amazingly done and completely nailbiting. I highly recommend this game as it is an edge of your seat thriller that has an amazing story line and even better plot development (that is solely based on how you handle different scenarios). Every action you take or words you decide to say have an everlasting effect on the remainder of the story. Lots of recognizable actors and it made me jump more than any movie I have ever watched.Watching the behind the scenes and R and D they put into this game made it even more enjoyable to play. I've been really enjoying the game. It has a great story, excellent voice acting, and some good jump-out-of-your-seat moments. I was skeptical, because of the reviews, but the game is a lot better than what it's getting credit for. I wouldn't say it's for everyone. But I feel you will be greatly rewarded if you go into this with an open-mind. It has a lot of replay value due to the varying outcomes that depend on your choices and actions. I would recommend this game to anyone that's a fan of the horror genre. This will be a quick, non-technical review. First off, I rented this from Redbox. It took me roughly 7 and a half hours on my first run, mainly because I was looking for every clue and totem in the game. Since the game is essentially like a playable movie, I would say even if you &#34;speed ran&#34; the game it would still take you 4-5 hours because you cannot skip scenes. This game is awesome! If you are a fan of horror movies, this is definitely a homage to them. The overall graphics, score and atmosphere is excellent. The characters are great cliche's of their horror movie counterparts and at first I was wanting pretty much all of them to die, but as the game developed I began routing for most of them.The plot is broken into a prologue, 10 story chapters and an epilogue. The plot itself is fairly predictable, but does have a few effective twists in the last quarter of the game.Pros:-Horror/Slasher genre is on point!-Visually this game is stunning, especially the lighting effects.-Hayden Panettiere, Peter Stomare, Rami Malek and Brett Dalton are superb. The rest of the cast is great, but not standouts.-The story was very unique (surprisingly) and had unforeseen twists.-A LOT to discover everywhere you go-Characters (other than Emily, Matt & Jessica) have growth over the entire story arc-The game truly has multiple endings-You can determine who from the group lives and dies by your actions-Controls are simplistic and work well with the game-type-Cinematography is eerily effective-Ability to revisit chapters to complete collection of clues & totemsCons:-Cannot skip cut scenes (mainly for re-playing chapters for trophy hunting)-Takes a few hours for the story to &#34;take off.&#34; Awesome game! I usually stay away from horror games, but I really loved this one. Went in not expecting much. Yeah it's more of a cinematic game, but they really pulled this off. Decent jump scares. Really loved how choices you made really affects everything. Got two people killed just because I barely moved my controller when I was supposed to keep it still. Amazing graphics. The second half became a bit weird, but it's good enough to like. Really a game to try out, even if you are too cheap to spend 60 dollars. There isn't one character in this whole game that is likeable. The characters are vapid idiots. The plot is mind numbing and boring - a page badly copied from 90s era horror movies. There is a lot of graphic animal murder which sucks - you can avoid some of it through choices. The graphics in the cut scenes are nice but the gameplay when walking is a clunky mess with jumpy camera angles. I feel like I overpaid to red box it one night. Boring, boring. Did I say boring? Amazing, just amazing. I have been looking forward to game from awhile ago when gameplay was released for this game. It has totally metmy expectations. They are some games such as Heavy Rain which is similar but after playing this game. I am saddened that there aren't many games like this.This is very fun to play with a couple of people. My friend and I just played through the whole game in one setting because it is that immersive andentertaining. You start to care about some of these characters because of the social interactions with other characters and it hurts when you havemade a bad decision that leads to a horrible fate for the character. Replayability in it to get it rightYou won't regret playing this game. Very fun especially with others. Probably the most fun I've had in a &#34;David Cage&#34; like game (e.g., Indigo Prophecy, Beyond Two Souls and Heavy Rain) and it wasn't even made by David Cage.  A very cool game where choices do matter.  Game elements, dialog, even character deaths can change by a simple choice or the finding of a clue.  There are jump scares aplenty, however, the real horror comes from a general sense of dread and anxiety that makes you on edge the entire time you're playing.  While I did rent it from Gamefly, I do recommend purchasing it (which I will).  Sony and game developers need to know video game enthusiasts want quality games like Until Dawn.  Play it.  You'll thank me! This is my game of the year so far by the fact that i actually had to force myself to put it down. The graphics, story, gameplay, sound, and the scares are all top notch. I've always been a fan of the &#34;interactive movie&#34; types of games and i have to say this is setting a new standard for what upcoming games of the genre have to live up to. No spoilers! No dumb downed ports, no on multiple platforms, this game was made for ps4 and it shows!  Until Dawn is a virtual movie. If you've played games like Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, Until Dark takes a bit from those games and utilizes the controls from those. Gameplay isn't the focus here, it comes down to the amazing story and your decision making.  The characters are lively, interesting, and the story is awesome.  You take control of multiple characters and you gain clues to solve things along the way. You make split second decisions that will affect the outcome of every situation and can also affect how the game ends. Starting out I thought the game itself was a little slow. But the introduction of the characters was required for you to really get attached to them and know each of their motives and stories. But the story really picks up and I was glued within no time!  The graphics are stunning in this game. Some of the best I've seen on ps4 so far.  Really struts out some nice visuals. My wife and I played it together and she was like &#34;man that looks so real&#34;  It really does look like a virtual movie.On a whole, this is one of my favorite ps4 games right now. Unique, great story, interseting characters and you won't want to put the controller down. I beat the game in about  8 hours. I find it to be quite worth your time and money. I hope maybe to see some added DLC in the future? Maybe some new episodes? Have fun! And God bless to all who read this. I have been gaming since 1981 when my parents bought me an Atari 2600 for Christmas.  And in all that time, Until Dawn is easily the biggest surprise I have ever had in a game.  And what a wonderful surprise it is.The game gets it all right.  I am not usually a fan of these type of &#34;adventure&#34; games.  I usually prefer to truly &#34;play&#34; the game.  But the whole adventure game thing is perfect for Until Dawn.  I never feel like the game is playing itself and I am just a spectator.  The controls are simple enough for the most part, that even someone new to games or the PS4 controller will be able to play with the minimum of frustration.  And even though the story is full of horror movie cliches (which I believe is the point), the story and characters are keeping me glued to my seat.  A chapter ends and I am worried...is so-and-so still alive?  I can't wait for the next chapter to start.  I am also a horror movie geek.  I love horror movies, but I am a snob.  I think 90% of horror movies are garbage and I tend to stay far away from horror movies that show up at the local cineplex.  And that was one of my main issues before I bought the game.  It is basically a playable horror movie...as the game makers will say in the bonus features, a playable &#34;teen&#34; horror movie.  Well I loved teen horror when I was a teen, but that was long ago.  I had no reason to worry.  The whole teen horror aspect works perfectly here and playing the game actually has me thinking I should check out some of these horror flicks I wrote off without giving them a chance.I have also played many games lately that are full of very annoying design choices or super frustrating mechanics.  Often it feels like game designers hate me.  Not here.  Nothing but love here.The voice acting is uniformly excellent.  The graphics are quite nice.  And the atmosphere is killer.  Thick and heavy and perfect.I always get annoyed when I hear a game is made to be played multiple times.  I think that is a cop out.  If you can't give me everything in one play, that is a failure.  But this game begs for a second, third, and beyond play through.  I actually can't wait to play more.  Can I save that character I lost the first time?  Can I get that idiot who I hate killed this time?  My only problem is Metal Gear Solid V comes out in 4 days....gonna cram this weekend full of Until Dark.I guess if I had to give a quick &#34;review&#34; of this game I would say that everything comes together perfectly in it.  If you love adventure games, but it.  If you horror movies, buy it.  If you are looking for a rip roaring fun time, buy it.  if you want to play a game that makes you scream and then makes me smile like you haven't smiled since you were a kid, buy it.  Just buy it...there is a lot of love in this game.  And even more fun. Wow! Until Dawn has to be one of the best horror games I've ever played. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen, and adds to the realism of the game. Until Dawn actually tailors the game to you, and what you fear most. Every single choice you make can change that characters relationship with someone else, change that characters characteristics, or lead that character or another character to danger/death.Ignore all the haters. Either they are Xbone fans who are jealous they can't get this game, or childish kids who only like games like COD, and don't care for the story. I purchased this from GameStop. Until Dawn is a delightfully cheesy horror themed suspense game that's full of tough decisions and intense moments. The story & plot are fantastic and the outcome depends on the choices you make. Its like watching an interactive movie, if you don't like QTE (Quick Time Events) then this game may not appeal to you. This game startled the HECK outta me many times, and despite its slower paced nature, it was a complete thrill. I enjoyed the moderate horror level, it was not extreme like P.T. (P.T. is the most terrifying game I've ever played, I literally couldn't finish it). I beat it multiple times to find all the collectibles, make different choices, get all trophies and change fate for a different ending. Below is my opinion on the Pros and Cons.  Pros: -Best graphics for any PS4 game to date -Breathtaking atmosphere & beautiful scenery -Great story and interesting plot -Brutal outcomes based on your decisions -Great sound effects & setting music, play this game with headphones! -Character relationship status changes depending on actions -Surprisingly NOT predicable ending/plot -Moderate replay value with alternate endings -Get your friends together and grab the popcorn, make a whole night of playing this. Much like in horror movies, the characters here will do something stupid that'll make you yell at your TV. The only difference is you'll also be screaming at yourself for the things YOU did!  Cons: -Game is rather short -Very slow movement speed... You can hold &#34;L1&#34; to walk like 10% faster but its still slow. From a &#34;glass is half-full&#34; perspective, the result of this causes you to appreciate the unique camera angles and beautiful scenery much more because you're not quickly running past everything. -Some decisions result in the same outcome regardless of what you choice... kind of pointless. That being said, there are plenty of difficult choices in the game that DO actually matter and ARE important. -Unskippable cut-scenes on second playthroughs. For this game I can understand why, because you may get a QTE prompt at ANY moment, so you have to stay tuned in. However this could get annoying during multiple playthroughs, which seems to be ideal for this type of game. I suspect that between this and the slow movement speed, the intention was to add X hours on a play-through so it seems longer.  I don't usually buy DLC, but I hope they make some for Until Dawn. Despite my elaboration on the cons, the PROS far outweigh the Cons, no contest. I give this a solid 8/10. I look forward to a squeal. Don't usually give reviews I'm an average gamer and I loved this game great graphics great replay value great story good set of characters some you'll love and want to save  some you will hate and want to die off at first I wasn't sure it was worth the 60 but after beating it 3 times its totally worth it This is the first game I play with my wife and we're having a blast. The production quality is just amazing. The story is horror cliche but the performances are really good and really sell the whole thing. Highly recommended if you want to experience the beginning of a new genre. Until Dawn is the very first game from developer Supermassive Games and you wouldn't know it given how good the game is. What first started life as a Playstation Move game on the PS3, Until Dawn never released in that form and was instead scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up for the PS4 to emulate the style of game that developer Quantic Dream has been making for years now, namely Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. However, unlike those titles, Until Dawn is a horror game. It's hard to find a direct comparison in video games when it comes to this style of horror. Many people might not have played it, but the closest thing I'd compare it to in terms of a horror game is Obscure from the 6th console generation. That was a teen horror game with all of the tropes that come with the genre. So if you've played Obscure, think of a better version of that married with Heavy Rain.In terms of gameplay, again, the closest comparison is Heavy Rain. You are exploring environments, finding clues, doing quick-time events during action scenes -- and these are done extremely well in this game and far more varied than in other games that offer them, etc. The gameplay is tied directly to the narrative to make it a cinematic and seamless experience. This isn't a game where you're just doing meaningless actions to pad a game's length, but each action services the storytelling.Graphically, Until Dawn is one of the best looking games out there. As someone who has all 3 current generation consoles, I haven't played many games on par with Until Dawn. Running on the Killzone: Shadow Fall engine, an engine capable of producing beautiful visuals, Until Dawn is a looker. However, that doesn't mean it's perfect as the framerate can chunk up in some areas, but these small issues are few & far between and it doesn't really tarnish the game's brilliance. Character model wise, these are some of the most detailed character models in any game, and these characters feel like real people, warts & all.In terms of being a horror game, Until Dawn isn't the scariest game you'll play -- it's a fun, campy, teen slasher -- but it still offers plenty of scares. So if you're a bit of a wimp when it comes to horror, don't worry. It's scary but not overly gross or terrifying.Please, please, please, if you have any interest in this game, pick it up. Remember, if you buy something and support it, it's more likely that we'll see more titles like this. If we don't support them, however, we won't, and that would be a shame. This is Supermassive Games debut, it's an interesting new IP, and it needs our support.To any employees of Supermassive Games: If you read this, thank you for the wonderful game that has been a treat for my spouse and I to experience together.ers feel like real people, warts & all.In terms of being a horror game, Until Dawn isn't the scariest game you'll play -- it's a fun, campy, teen slasher -- but it still offers plenty of scares.

Best game ever Is it worth buying the game ? Amazing game! Best story and graphics ever seen in a thriller game. Highly recommended. received the game yesterday since i pre-ordered it last minute.. i haven't finished it yet but so far i like it. its like a mixture of the movie, saw and cabin in the woods.. even though both movies are complete trash (my opinion) but the game is totally different since YOU get to make the decisions. some decisions are difficult to make and others are just whatever.. you get into depth with each character with their personality and so forth. I'm pretty much almost done with the game and i'm excited to play the bonus content that is only for those who pre-ordered it like me :D If I were to compare the scariness with this and Outlast. I'd have to say outlast is a bit more scarier. Until Dawn is that type of game where you panic because you never know if your decisions will end a character dead.. (some decisions have a timer) + the things you have to do especially the blue motion center.. it can pop up anytime when you're trying to hide from an enemy or just staying still.. there are some pop ups as well. anyone playing this in the future, i think you'll enjoy it because i'm having a blast playing this game. (also want to mention that, hayden panettiere is lovely) If you like cheesy 80's horror/slasher flicks, and 'choose your own adventure' stories/games, this is for you.I am a huge horror fan, especially 80's. My favorite aspect of this game is the sound and cinematography. When you're walking down a snowy path, hearing footsteps in the snow, wind, trees, animals, and the camera changes to a view where someone on the hillside is watching your movements, and reacting by hiding, and heavily breathing, it really is an 80's horror film. Plenty of homage is paid to some classics as well. It's a &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; cinematic masterpiece. Some people may be upset that it isn't a &#34;game&#34; per se, but there's plenty of mechanics and exploration that are not QTE related. Really the fun lies in deciding who you want your characters to be, and playing them out as such.As I mentioned the sound earlier, that's where the real jump scares come from, and there's plenty. I really enjoyed the twists and scares, and if you have an open mind, you will too.I give it a 9 instead of a 10 because the movement can be slow sometimes (but not like Rapture), and you couldn't always make decisions that you feel your character would. There's usually only 2 choices, and some events could really benefit from more. Having been crushingly disappointed by &#34;choose&#34;-your-own-adventrues in the past, I was genuinely shocked by the level of thought and development in this. While its so chock full of horror cliches you'd think it was a parody, they're handled so well and delivered creepily enough to make it worthwhile.The division of plot lines is really well handled, and while a decision at the very beginning doesn't have ripples all the way up to closing credits, it does have ripples past the canned scene. And while the overall feel is as an interactive movie, thats not a bad thing in this case, as the characters are actually characters. While they are all sex-fueled teenagers, past that point they do develop and have impressions beyond Blonde Murder Victim #4 and Brunette Murder Victim #2.Gameplay does have some down moments. Certain qte's don't have any warning, and the still sensor (where you don't move) is so sensitive that putting on a flat surface is too much. Certain moments shouldn't be qte's, but overall, the system works well. The Butterfly effect system is great, as it shows you you did x so y and z.THe game development is great, especially with the psychotropic therapist, which serves to cater and modify the story. Terrified of Clowns? The murderer is suddenly sporting a mask. Scared of rats? They'll start to appear in the worst possible places. Amazing game! Best game on PS4, I. My opinion and game of the year 2015. The first hour starts off slow and the graphics look weird at first - I think this prologue part of the game may have been added in in a rush and they didn't optimize it correctly? After the prologue, you'll see the graphics are literally photo realistic and the sound is also amazing. The story is top notch and took me about 10 hours to complete.  I cannot believe how convincing the characters are. Again, do not judge the game based on the first hour or two. Once the action starts the game is a ten out of ten. Do not spoil the game by reading tons of info or watching streams! I bought a PS4 for this game and do not regret it one bit. Like I said, starts off slow but once the action starts you won't want to stop playing. Lots of replay value because all your characters can live or die depending in your choices. absolutely worth $60. I loved Heavy Rain on PS3 which played similar to this but honestly, Until Dawn completely destroys Heavy Rain on every level.Must. Own. Game. This is the killer (pun intended) PS4 exclusive we've all been waiting for and certainly my game of the year and generation thus far. This game is freaky scary and the characters you either love or hate, which both in their own mean that they did a good job. I LOVE IT! I HATE Jess, but I like that I hate her. I want Sam and Ashley to live, so I will do everything in my power to help them. That is good narrative if you care enough about someone to love them or hate them. Cheesy dialogue is intermixed with real personality and humor. The plot is intriguing and suspenseful. It is fun playing with a group and everyone helping make the decisions together. Definitely worth the money. Absolute masterpiece!If you are a fan of horror, Heavy Rain, or having your choices be the deciding factor on characters living or dying, a long or short story, and the overall outcome of the game. Then get this game! It is hard to stop playing this game. It is an interesting story that keeps you wanting to find out more while you feel like an integral part of the story. I would highly recommend this game. I love this game!! I recommend this game to anyone who likes interactive/horror games! Great game it is worth buying your choices depend on what happens next you won't regret buying it if you love horror games you'll like this Definitely the best survival horror game of the year! Beat it in about 9 hours, let my system rest for two hours and booted it up again. An unexpected and stunning narrative with intense gameplay and impactful choices all along the way. Best Horror Experience Ever!!! Loved it! Scares the craps out of my little 13 Year old cousin. Witch I love even more mwahaha lol. Great level design, amazing animations, great cast, and fantastic  performances. The story is well written and gets yu guessing til the end. I have been looking forward to this game for months and it does not disappoint.I was a big fan of choose your own adventure books as a kid and this reminds me of those books except in a videogame. Like watching a movie where you can influence the outcome.The graphics look great to me and the voice acting is spot on. Some of the facial expressions are awkward but I feel like it worked for this type of campy horror game.Definitely different than a lot of other games out there and worth a try! An early tragedy in the game causes the death of some characters who we are introduced to at the very beginning of the game.  After 1 year, friends decide to reunite up in a lonely ski lodge cabin, although many have clear reservations about the inappropriateness of the venue and the circumstances that befell them 1 year prior.  And that's about all the story spoiling that you'll get from me and the 8 characters who meet their fate at the hands of your own decision-making.  This game is a definite love letter to the 90's horror flick. It has a definite Scream meets Final Destination vibe to it with Butterfly Effect concepts shamelessly sprinkled into it. What makes it all the more intriguing is the &#34;butterfly effect&#34; story system. Seemingly innocuous choices--including an early choice to see who is calling your friend's cell phone when it's none of your business--affect the story further down the line. As a result, there is HUGE replay potential here. What would have happened if I left the cell phone alone? What happens if I decide to throw a snowball at a bird instead of my friend instead? A flutter of butterflies in the upper left-hand corner of the screen will briefly signal that you've made a choice that affects the story further down the line...you never know if the choice that you're making on the first playthrough is going to matter or not, but as soon as you make it, you'll know that you've chosen a fate, no matter &#34;how the hell does that affect anything&#34; may seem at the time. Add to that unusual 4th wall-breaking sessions with a doctor between &#34;scenes&#34; who asks questions about what makes you uneasy/anxious/scared and you have created an exotic mixture of &#34;what the hell is going to happen to me now?!?&#34; And there are bigger questions - the doctor is talking to you...but who are YOU??  It's somewhat surreal and even has you questioning why he's talking to you and why it even matters.  What's even MORE fun is the discovery of totems that are color-coded based on the type of event that they foretell and offer you a very brief glimpse of the future. All of these diverse elements do a great job in adding dread to the game. That, and there are clues scattered throughout the area that may/may not help you unravel the mystery of what's going on and may/may not help you save more lives literally UNTIL DAWN.  Maybe it matters...maybe it doesn't.  Maybe harming a small animal affects something.  You'll never know...until you try...and see the consequences of your various actions unfold.  Decisions also affect how people interact with you...and whether or not they'll be willing to help you later.  While the system feels obvious on the surface, how it ultimately unfolds is not unlike a Walking Dead experience as executed by TT Games.  It's fantastic fun and I can't wait to try alternative roads in the future.  If you liked Heavy Rain, you'll be in good company here....except that the game mechanics are not nearly as clunky and they feel like they make more sense. QTE moments help to ratchet up the tension and they don't feel cheap...when you're on the run, having good reflexes make sense and they don't cheapen the experience like Resident Evil 6 did, for example. So far, I'm giving it a 4.75/5. It's not perfect, but I'm dying to play it some more already...I've only scratched the surface; that alone warrants a full 5 stars for me. A game like this has been a loooong time in the making and I'm glad that it's here.  One additional note:  the score is exceptional on this film.  The song &#34;O Death&#34; will give you chills as the opening credits roll and sets the tone for the game early.  Voice acting is great and the game is very self-aware of its roots, and rolls around in its genre's playground willingly and with a great amount of fun I might add.  Enjoy the ride...it's going to be a long night. Game revolves around a group of friends who go back to an old mountain lodge owned by one of the characters a year after a tragedy happensIf you've played Heavy Rain or Beyond Two Souls, and liked them, then you'll like this game. It has basically the same style game play. I'm probably about half-way through the game and I still am not sure exactly what is going on. I like that the story changes depending on what decisions you make (the butterfly effect). And also each character you play (you end up at one point or another playing each character the game revolves around, which is 8 characters, 6 of which I've played so far) has stats that change depending on what decisions you make in the game. Bravery, romantic, honest, funny, etc...and also for each character, that character has relationship stats for all the other characters that change. So your relationship with the other characters you interact with changes depending on your decisions, as well as your personality.It's a mystery/horror game. Some of the atmosphere reminds me of The Evil Within and the Saw movies as well as the heavy, disturbing atmosphere of Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls.If you don't like the action-button-timing type play, you'll hate the game probably. If you love horror flicks and games, and don't mind the lack of beating the crap out of stuff, you'll love it and it's worth a play or two.I'm looking forward to replaying and trying to find out how the story line changes. What another waste of time thanks Sony just keep bringing the garbage. Just and another cinematic game . This game has everything from screams to regrets. Every move you make affects the next outcome. Extremely well done, not to be missed by any gamer, not just fans of the genre. Scares are great, the attack on your psyche is a nice touch, and the level of polish seals the deal. Sex starved teens in a choose your own adventure style = win. By far one of the greatest games I have ever played. I love horror games. I have played and own every resident evil known to date. I just love survival horror games. Outlast was great as well. This is somewhat, like the walking dead style gameplay except you have way more choices which may or may not have a greater affect. BTW this game WILL make you say what the actual F@#$ just happened. People who say it's just like a interactive movie are wrong. This has more game play then the walking dead series. Your constantly walking around picking up objects, passing objects that may be key to survival. Not only is this game scary, but innovative in how the story unfolds. Decisions you make throughout the game customize the experience. Scared of clowns? The game finds out and serves a bad guy with a clown mask. It's very fun and even has an option to record your reaction during scary parts without you knowing so you can watch your face and laugh later. The story is cheesy, but that's the point - it's a horror game. This is such a good game. I wont spoil anything but you have to say what your fears are then the game uses your fears to scare you then the story has a huge plot twist at the very end. Worth $60. Until Dawn is a really cool adrenaline rush of a game when one wrong move can get one of the 8 characters killed. I have literally been dying for game like this since probably Friday the 13th for NES. But one with graphics and gameplay like Heavy Rain and Until Dawn definitely delivers what I was hoping for.Spoiler: Except for the fact that I was hoping for a slasher game like Heavy Rain with Friday the 13th gameplay. Until Dawn turning into another game where you fight off monsters is a slight disappointment. There's enough games like that already. However, Until Dawn is one of the best of those games.While if you don't like the ending and you got your favorite characters killed. You can replay the whole game or just a couple of chapters to try and get a better ending.  Here's to hoping the company makes an actual slasher game with similar game play in the future. I'd pre-order that in a second. This game was still amazing either way. While playing homage to slasher flicks, this game plays like a combination of a Telltale game and classic Resident Evil.  Like the Telltale games, narrative and player choice are front and center, but this time around the production level is very high and the term &#34;interactive movie&#34; has never been more appropriate.  I mean that in a very positive way.  It is a true blend of video game and cinema experience, and in fact the player is given more control of the character actions and movements then I had initially expected. I expect/hope this genre will continue to grow and become much more popular.  Although there are a few weird character movement animations, for the most part the motion capture animation is quite amazing, which in turn serves to highlight the strength of the cast (true, the acting and script can be over-the-top, but that comes with the territory in this genre).I have played through the game completely once.  I plan to play again, and it will be interesting to see the different ways your choices can alter the outcome, though I suspect that there will be diminishing returns in repeat playthroughs as it becomes more apparent which portions of the story are set in stone and how much of the choice is illusory.  Still, just the knowledge that any of the 8 main characters can either die or survive depending on how you play the game really serves to up the ante as you creep around the &#34;cabin in the woods&#34; environment.Combat itself isn't a large portion of the game, but when it happens it is done through quicktime events.  One twist on that concept is that sometimes it is actually best to NOT perform the prompted action (for example, there may be quicktime event prompt to perform an attack, but it may be better to do nothing and stay hidden).While there are things that could be improved, this game represents a big step in the genre, and I hope developers continue and expand on the experience delivered here. One of the best games ever made , first 30 minutes starts slow but then it gets much better . Game is very addicted good job sony This. This is the game that you need to own if you enjoy anything horror. I hadn't even heard of this game until I was browsing new PS4 games and realized that this one didn't even sound familiar to me. Honestly, I'm glad that I didn't know about this because if I had, I would be itching to play it and waiting for the launch.After reading many reviews about how awesome this game is, I pulled the trigger, drove to the store, bought it, and was instantly hooked. When I look for horror genre related books/movies/games, I am looking for something that will hold my attention and that is suspenseful, engaging, and realistic. This game is the perfect mix of all three of those. To top it all off, it is truly chilling.Just reading the description, I was instantly engaged: &#34;When eight friends become trapped on a remote mountain getaway gone wrong, things quickly turn sinister and they start to suspect they aren\u2019t alone. Every choice the player makes while playing as each of the eight friends \u2013 even the seemingly trivial ones \u2013 will carve out a unique story. The player's actions alone determine who survives until dawn.&#34; I mean, come on, that's just amazing.Until Dawn is a game where player choice determines the outcomes in each chapter as well as the ending. With this being the case, you can literally play the game multiple times and have a different outcome each and every time. All I can say is give this game a shot. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are even better.The gameplay of Until Dawn focuses on quick time events, and discovering clues. A system is added to keep progress of all the secrets you find, which can help you piece things together. It's been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain. The player can take control of each of the eight characters, and can make simple choices which will effect the way the game plays out, resulting in deaths or other mayhem. There are over thousands of different endings possible in the game.I'd love to hear from anyone on how they feel the game is the further they get into the story, and I will plan on doing the same.sible in the game.I'd love to hear from anyone on how they feel the game is the further they get into the story, and I will plan on doing the same. A beautifully created atmosphere of horror is the best way to describe this game.  It reminded me a lot of Heavy Rain but with a different plot and setting.  I highly recommend it for gamers who love the horror genre.  It's 6-hours or so long, which is on par with similar games of this structure... but, of course, it has great replay value if you love the game because almost every action creates a different plot turn/ending.  I really enjoyed this game! The best game ever period acting super and rich story line and gorgeous graphics it deserves game of the year Before I begin this review I must clarify I am not a fan of adventure, point and click, interactive sort of games. A good example on how these sorts of games can be considered mediocre and boring, just play one of David Cage's games and you will know what I mean. With the exception of Tell Tale Walking Dead Series. Usually games like the Beyond Two Souls and Indigo Prophecy in my eyes are mediocre.Now I will not bore you will a long review, and state the many accomplishment Until Dawn has in it's game. But instead I will explain my reasoning on why you should purchase this game and enjoy the many wounder for yourself.1. It's not a corny and goofy wanna be game; as I first thought when i saw the trailer for it. To its core the game provides moments of great suspense and interesting view point on how the game will develop throughout your session.  Moreover for the most part (except for 2 characters) the cast of Until Dawn are a likable bunch with their unique features to like and dislike.2. I am going to be honest with you if you are a fast paste, FPS, MMO, MOBO, or RTS type of gamer (like me), this game will not quite satisfy you because its an exploring game as well. Therefore you must set your mind in a way an RPG player might have who enjoys exploring and immersing yourself in. If you get that mind set you will start to enjoy the game, if you are stuck with a fast paste mind set you might hate the game or struggle through it.3. Simple to the point, it has many choices and they do weigh a great deal through the game. The choices in Until Dawn are not like some other games I played in which you might think it will impact the game progression but in reality it does nothing.  (I'm looking at you Dragon Age Inquisition)4. Finally I would say you will get your moneys worth, I beat the game in about 18 hours in a relax paste, and I have no regret spending 60 dollars on it.  So I would say you should buy the gameand enjoy the game charm. Thank you for reading and sorry for my poor English I am not a native speaker. I don't normally write reviews, but I felt like I needed to counteract some of the troll reviews which are not about the game, and are really dumb,(look at the one star reviews you'll see what I'm saying,) but I digress. So Until Dawn is a cinematic story driven adventure horror game with multiple endings and a dynamic story and very well done (motion captured)characters. The graphics are amazing and due to the choices the player makes, you will not be able to see nearly everything in one time playing it. If you like Heavy Rain, The wolf among us, etc. you will most likely enjoy this fantastic game very much. Thank you for reading my review. If you're into the horror genre and love all the clich\u00e9's you'll love this.The story is really good and the choices really do matter.The graphics are amazing probably the best part about this game.This game only takes 7 hours to beat and is totally replayable if you don't like the ending you get. Great game, very compelling and the story is phenomenal. Get the Bose surround sound out and turn it up! If you loved the game Heavy Rain and you like slasher movies with a little drama then you'll love Until Dawn. I sat down with my girlfriend to try the game and I didn't put the controller down til the end. If your looking for fast paced shoot em up id look elsewhere. The graphics are probably the best I've seen so far. Ill be playing this a few more times to try to get all the different paths and endings and the trophies. I giveActing 5/5Fun Though slow at times a 4/5Graphics 5/5 Great game! Well acted, great motion capture and face/body models and extremely polished AAA graphics. Also, does not suffer from darkness, unlike most games similar to Until Dawn, the vey dark scenes(which is almost the entire game) things are actually quite visible when they are supposed to be. No muddy quality or ghosting due to poor post processing and lack of lighting.The acting is top notch and almost all the actors are either well-known or recognizable. It mashes all the great things from some stellar games into one. The Great modeling of faces and motion capture (do you can clearly tell who the actor is and even if you don't know their name it's oh hey that's the chick from... And that's the guy who's in all that other $@&t) pf L.A. noire, not to mention the gameplay and &#34;choose you own adventure&#34; results of heavy rain 3.0 on roids and Beyond:Two Souls 2.5 on aderall. Voice acting is top tier as well.What isn't outright scary and &#34;OMFG moment of shocked and aweness&#34; is just super creepy. Reminiscent of deadly premonition in parts, with a less twin peaks vibe than DP( but definitely a modern homage to classic Lynchian works especially the Frost and Lynch TP) in its own right. Just much darker and gore ridden. It's more like twin peaks, was in the pitch dark, reading an H.P. Lovecraft collection re written by Stephen King and Joe Hill whilst on a father and son fishing trip on ketamine in Alaska during dark days, watching Saw in the background while playing all the quantic dreams and telltale games rolled into a single hybrid.All this praise and I will say, that like almost everything, it's not perfect. Because of the gameplay design, and the scope of the ever changing action and reactions and the cost your decisions do have, I've noticed some inconsistencies (especially when doubling back and replaying certain instances over and making different choices). But it's not sloppy or overalls distracting. The immersion is rarely ever lifted. Even during the (SPOILERZ) analysis scenes were the fourth wall is clearly broken , but in very interesting and creative ways. The pacing is almost always fluid, it's just there's certain parts where your on a frantic fast paced chase or flee, and all of a sudden you get full control of your character again and while the music is straight outta a car chase from a horror movie, and your hearts still pounding from what just happened, what's in the middle of happening, and what's gonna happen, and you are literally slowly walking or walking at a brisk pace to save someone or yourself until the next cattle shoot interactive cutscene/button mashing timing sequence begins again. It's rare, but pacing flaws like this do exist but they are short enough to forgive as your right back into the action or on to the next story.Also it's extremely hard to manipulate the system to get the results you want. For a number of reasons. Those who play will get the sense that when answering certain questions might be good,bad or a trick, I can tell you from replaying that it's never what you think. If you think it's a trick, it's not. If you think it isn't a trick, it kinda is. If you think your being given questions solely for the purpose that those people will die depending on your answers, it's not that simple at all. The system is much more complex then it lets you believe and the recycled scenes for multiple choices is almost non-existent.This game is a rare Gem, as it not only lives up to the hype, it far exceeds it. And while it is a bit on the short side (8-10!hours depending on your play style and choices) there's a ridiculous amount of replayability.  I will say this, after the first few minutes the next half hour or soay seem forced, just go with it as it's not only worth but makes sense later on as it sets up tons of things and is more interactive and consequncial than it lets on to be, as most things in the game are. 9.7/10 I was 100% psyched to get this. I did not have a PS3 (had a 360) so missed out on Heavy Rain. Then when I heard they were making a game with the same formula but with a horror twist. I knew I had to get the game. After playing it through the first time. I had good intuition. I was hooked in the moment I started playing. Now the game is short. Ive heard of people beating it in one day. Which was expected considering how when a character dies they stay dead until you restart the game from scratch.Every choice matters no matter how small. Something trivial early in the game can determine someone's fate. Heck sometimes doing the right thing can end in a death even if you did it to possibly save one. Twice I made a choice that anyone of us would make whether make sure someone is being protected or helping someone calling for help. But it caused a person's death.A nice feature is in the menu is when you make a choice that leads to a butterfly affect you can view it and when something happens later in game you can see what choice led to that moment. One problem I had with the game is people compared it to a interactive movie but to me it was either a short season of a tv show or a mini series. Not because the game is divided into chapters (10 in all) but there wasn't really a central story. It jumps to a whole another story eventually and the game didn't need to have one and the other. A full game with one of the stories would have been great.Despite the faults after the credits rolled with the survivors reeling in (3 of the 8 survived) I was wanting more. I will of course play it again and try to have more...or dare I say...less survivors. Not that many games can say people want to play more long after the game ends. With the game being advertised as having hundreds of endings, many scenarios based on choices. The replay value is high.If you want a great scary game, with a good cast. Get this...but as some reviews show. Itsnot for everyone. But if you liked Telltale's walking dead, wolf among us, etc where choices matter get this. This is an amped version of them. As you can die and then start the level again in those. Like in real life death is final...or until you start from scratch. If you don't want this now, get it for Halloween.and remember. Anyone can live, anyone can die, everyone can live...and everyone can diePros:-Almost every choice matters-High replay value-Good actors-good scares-a lot of twists and turns-reviewing past butterfly affects and what they causedCons:-short game-game never really has a center plot-not for everyone This game reminded me of playing through the original Resident Evil for the Playstation. I LOVE IT!! This game was INCREDIBLE. I've been excited for it for a very long time, and I finally got it yesterday.First of all, let me just tell you that I got scared. This is an intense, terrifying game!! I screamed a few times!! It was so crazy!! Choices you make really make a difference. They can hurt you, your friends, and can change your entire experience. One wrong move, and the lives of every character can be twisted around. They're scary, they're intense, and they are powerful.Second, I don't want to say it's perfect. There are parts where the characters don't seem realistic. Their reactions are too over-the-top or too &#34;meh&#34; sometimes. Like, someone got mutilated. You shouldn't just go back to your stuff. Other times, it's something small making a character cry. Calm down, please!!!! Also, the walking mechanics are a bit boring and clumsy at times. The environments are too dark at times, too. I have gotten completely lost, too. One time I walked alllllll the way down a tunnel before noticing that it was the wrong way because they looked the same.The bad parts are very minor, but I wanted to tell you them. This review was very quick, but I need to get back to the game. I've almost beat it!!!! And you bet your last dollar that I'll do it again!!!! In today's world, a lot of people like to look at review sites to influence their purchasing decisions. When researching Until Dawn, you'll read about how no one playthrough will be the same as another because of the deep butterfly system that can alter the plot based on the most minor of choices. In fact, one professional review mentions hundreds of different endings and thousands of branching points. Sadly, this is not the case.  The interesting part is that first time players will be captivated by Until Dawn. The story draws you in at the beginning and it makes you feel like your choices actually DO matter. However, once you reach the end, it becomes clear that much more of the plot is set in stone regardless of your decisions than was previously advertised. It's hard to go into detail without mentioning spoilers, but the ending with a playthrough where everyone survives versus one where everyone dies are actually incredibly similar. As a result, this game has stunted replayability. Furthermore, the playthroughs that were originally said to take around ten hours or so clock out closer to six or seven hours.  Is Until Dawn a bad game? No, not at all. If you enjoy the Telltale series, you'll definitely get a kick out of it. However, the devs and a lot of reviewers seem to have blown a lot of aspects of this game out of proportion, thus creating expectations based on a work of fiction. This game is absolutely amazing, beautiful graphics, very good actors, the story is so very well done and the jump scares are perfect. I will be playing this game over again with different choices. I have been playing video games since I was little and I have to say this is truly an experience to play this game, it's the best game I have ever played! If you haven't played this game yet or you're unsure about it, get it! You will not be disappointed I promise. They need to make more games like this in the future, this deserves game of the year! &#60;3 Very fun game!  I cant believe someone hasnt come up with the idea to do this with a horror game yet.  I hear people saying they think the acting is bad when actually its great and is suppose to be cheesy.  Thats what makes this fun is that we are playing something like a classic horror game but we get to make the choices to see if we can survive! Overall:About 30% complete with the game and so far I'm loving it! If you enjoy interactive movie type games such as Heavy Rain (PS3) and Indigo Prophecy (PS2), you'll love this game. This game is primarily about telling you a story where you make decisions that could impact how the story unfolds. So don't expect a first person shooter or action type game. You will walk around the map finding clues and watching cutscenes with minimal action buttons in between.Bugs:For a day one release, I am pretty impressed. It seems the last several games I have gotten day one have been packed with bugs. Not the case with Until Dawn. I haven't encountered a single hiccup, restart, or freeze. And I don't really recall even downloading a patch when I put the disc in.Controls:Again, for a day one release, I have not encountered any control issues. Pretty basic stuff as far as walking around with the left analog stick. The right analog stick moves the camera ever so slightly. A triangle here, a circle here, and a few Xs. They even incorporated the use of the pad in certain scenes. Nothing really advanced or hard to get used to. There's even a little tutorial as you're moving around to tell you what controls to use.Story:The story is what this game is all about. The story is pretty similar to a typical horror flick. A group of teens, a few cabins in the woods, and a killer on the loose! Several scenes are designed to make you jump and the really good ones will record you if you have a Playstation Camera attached. Don't worry, by default this setting is turned off, so you will need to turn it on in the options if you want to see a playback of the scene and your reaction.You do get a chance to play as each of the characters with no option of switching between them. Each character has their own sort of story as they split off from the main group. So far, I haven't been too attached to any of the characters. I feel like that's onepart that could have been improved on. That said, the overall story is keeping me interested and wanting to find out more. Awesome game! Graphics are on point, story is great and you can't beat the interaction that controls the outcome of the game. I have not put this game down. I have spent around 14 hours playing the game across two complete play through's. The story is a mashup scenes from classic horror movies. They also throw in some Chaos Theory ideas. There are unique endings dependent on choices and anyone can die. The way the game analyses your own fears and uses them against you is a good concept as well. I do not believe I was ever scared but I was on edge the whole time.If you enjoy Horror Movies, The Butterfly Effect, Heavy Rain, or just being able to make the dumb blonde girl run instead of being killed like a idiot, then support this Developer and buy this game. If they get the support they need I believe we will see even better things from them in the future. This game was just as good as i expected it to be. There were some let downs but every movie/game has their let downs. It was so good that i spent the whole entire day finishing it only to want to save the people that had died just so that i could have them come back to life. It was an amazing game!

If u like heavy rain u will love it, if u didn't then u won't.  It is like a movie, there are a lot of parts that make u jump, and make u laugh. the graphics are amazing, and the butterfly effect is awsome. I just started playing it over for the second time now, also has to be played in the dark and quiet as can be in your house, enjoyThanks hope this review will help The state of modern slasher movies is pretty saddening. In the 80's, 90's, and even early 2000's, these dominated the horror film market, giving viewers increasingly absurd and implausible situations to watch teenagers get hacked to bits over. That's an oversimplification, of course. There were dozens of genuinely good movies that took the formula and twisted it around in fun ways. &#34;April Fool's Day,&#34; for example, or &#34;Sleepaway Camp,&#34; &#34;Scream,&#34; and maybe even every &#34;Friday The 13th&#34; after the sixth one. The point I'm making is, this is a genre in need of some love. All we get now are the same ghost stories, the same &#34;found footage&#34; flicks, ad nauseum. The only thing in recent years that's truly impressed me was the gleefully chaotic &#34;Unfriended,&#34; and that wasn't even a &#34;proper&#34; slasher flick. So, with Supermassive Game's much-hyped &#34;Until Dawn&#34; presenting itself as a sort of interactive slasher movie, I got pretty giddy with excitement. But is it another &#34;Night Trap,&#34; the deservedly ill-fated Sega CD &#34;game&#34;? Or is this finally the resurgence I've been waiting for?The answer is &#34;sort of kind of,&#34; but don't let that sound like a knock against the quality of this riveting little thrill ride of a game. Because, up through the very last moment, &#34;Until Dawn&#34; delivers not only more scares, more twists, and more ridiculous gore than most modern horror films, but manages to hearken back to the PS2 glory days of survival horror while it's at it. It's the best of modern and classic horror films, while still managing to be a surprisingly proficient game in its own right. Oh, and did I mention that it's horrifying? Because it really is.Truthfully, the set-up is perhaps the most benign and predictable out there, at least as far as these sorts of affairs go. Some teenagers go to a remote ski lodge one year after two of their friends bit the dust, trying to rekindle the flames of their friendship. Of course, most of them are also trying to get laid, because this is a horror joint and of course they are. Sadly, not one, but two masked maniacs are there to try and put a damper on their fun, to the tune of flamethrowers, &#34;Saw&#34;-style death chambers, and trained wolves. Also, ghosts, Also, ambiguously cannibalistic monsters. Also, ancient Native American spirits. Yep.The thing about &#34;Until Dawn&#34; is that none of it makes any sense until about 3/4 of the way through the game, and believe it or not, that actually works to its advantage. Instead of being content to scare players with one consistent threat, there are numerous forces to contend with, and none of them feel like they have any connection with each other. What does a ghost have to do with a perverted man in a clown mask, or a flamethrowing maniac with malevolent mountain creatures? More than you might think, actually, and that's where the true strength of &#34;Until Dawn&#34;'s narrative comes to the forefront.In 2012, &#34;Cabin in the Woods&#34; took every horror movie trope imaginable and mashed them together, then gave the most cop-out and ludicrous reason why they were all there. Of course, that's a great movie, but it went really far with the absurd comedy. &#34;Until Dawn&#34; does the polar opposite. It takes every horror trope imaginable, then gives a completely plausible and compelling reason why, exactly, all of them decided to converge on this particular night and assail this particular set of teens. The late-game twists aren't actually funny... at least, not intentionally. Everything feels very sincere and authentic in its attempts to weave a yarn, and that's something I admire. It's not cheap. It's not a satire. It's horror, through and through, until the very end.That counts double for the gameplay as well, which is a glorious and satisfying return to older survival horror games. Cantered camera angles, slow controls, selective lighting... it's all here, recreated in loving detail by a developer who obviously cares about the genre. Even the best new horror titles either take a first-person view (&#34;Alien: Isolation,&#34; &#34;P.T.,&#34; ) or an over-the-shoulder view (&#34;Dead Space,&#34; &#34;The Evil Within,&#34;) when it comes to guiding the player. Not &#34;Until Dawn.&#34; The camera is perpetually at a fixed angle, bringing to mind the vintage &#34;Silent Hill&#34; or &#34;Resident Evil&#34; titles. However, because this is 2015, the controls are more responsive, more smooth, when it comes to directing characters to their potential demise. It takes an aspect about older horror games that I positively adore, them modernizes it in a way that I had previously thought to be impossible.But where the gameplay diverges a bit is in the combat. Namely, there isn't really any, outside of some context-sensitive events, which play out very much like a game helmed by David Cage. However, this is Cage gameplay in the hands of a developer who actually knows what they're doing, so the result is a game that doesn't feel like an interactive movie. In PS2-era survival horror games, confronting the threats at hand would lead into bouts of janky combat that sometimes worked, sometimes didn't. I have a soft spot for that gameplay, but it just doesn't hold up in this day and age. &#34;Until Dawn&#34; takes the survival horror mold, rips out the combat, and replaces it with quick-time event segments. Now, I really hate modern gaming's reliance on QTEs, as I usually feel like it's just an excuse for lazy game design, but in the case of this game, it actually works. They're not abused, and when they're used, it feels urgent and tense. And, most importantly, you usually see immediate consequences for failing them. Characters will lose items, get hurt, and sometimes straight-up die if you miss prompts. In most games, players will just see a slight riff on the same basic flow of events. In &#34;Until Dawn,&#34; the central gimmick of &#34;you control who lives and dies&#34; ends up feeling like a fulfilled (and tense) promise as opposed to marketing hype-speak.That could be said of this whole package. Everything about the way &#34;Until Dawn&#34; has been marketed made me think I'd despise it. &#34;It's an interactive slasher movie,&#34; they said. &#34;It has cutting edge visuals and well-known actors,&#34; they said. &#34;It'll make you scream out loud,&#34; they said. I scoffed at all of this, but I was proven wrong. This game is a subversive and truly disturbing take on slasher films, and takes some totally out-of-left-field twists near the end that made me cackle at their absurdity. It has some truly gorgeous visuals, perhaps the best on the PS4, aided by a haunting and masterful art direction and some stellar performances from Panettiere, Rami Malek, and, most importantly, the inimitable Peter Stormare. And, all tied together with tense gameplay that blends old-school progression and new-school action, the result is a tense, terrifying experience that made me actually cover my eyes and scream out loud more times than I'd like to admit.&#34;Until Dawn&#34; was something that I went in expecting to hate every hour it dragged on, but instead, I found myself hanging on every second, even through the ending credits. The scares feel very real and palpable. The threat of permanent death is around every corner. The plot keeps you guessing even after the game wraps up. Simply put, Supermassive has taken my favorite type of interactive horror experience and modernized it, crafting something that genuinely scares and feels like it has a lot of love put into it. Aided by a great deal of replay value, the whole package feels like the rare AAA, &#34;cinematic&#34; game that never loses sight of being a game, and the result of that is the scariest game that will probably come out this year, maybe even within a few years.Slasher movies may be past their heyday, but if &#34;Until Dawn&#34; is any indication, enough people still care to keep doing novel, clever, and, most importantly, scary takes on them. Only, this time, we got a stellar horror game instead of another movie. And truth be told? I'll take it.Pros:- A twisty and absurd story that shocks through the ending.- Loads of replay value that's organized in a steamlined way.- Tense gameplay that feels interactive and not passive.- A great throwback to older titles with some fresh twists.- Beautiful visuals that render an excellent art direction.Cons:- The early hours are deceptively simple.- Absurd late-game twists might not impress everyone.Score: 9.25 (out of 10)of events.

Following horror clich\u00e9s, everyone is horny for each other and the melodrama is laid on thick until eventually the lights go out and bodies hit the floor.Until Dawn is the interactive movie style genre taken to its most extreme. Gameplay is limited to exploring small areas, examining clues, and making binary dialog choices at key moments. Each character has different attributes that dictate their honesty or bravery as well as their relationship with the other characters. Some action scenes call for quick time events including aiming a weapon or holding the controller still.What makes this game truly unique is that your choices --actually-- matter. Addressing a criticism with Telltale or Quantic Dreams games, Until Dawn features an element called &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34; where your choices have an impact on following events. Practically drawing from games like The Witcher or Alpha Protocol, your actions (or even inaction) won't have a noticeable effect until make later. This is all tracked in-game with a handy menu that shows what choice you made and how it effects the flow of events that follow. You can't replay sections until you beat the game: once you choose that's it.Until Dawn revels in its genre. Aesthetically it pays homage to modern horror like Saw with the tongue-in-cheek self awareness of Scream, the cinematography and pacing of Halloween, and the sex charged melodramatic characterization of Friday the 13th. Horror movie fans will find something to like and it makes a great game to play with non-gamer friends who scream out suggestions for choices. Visually it's above average with realistic yet creepy facial capture (Peter Stormare's character being a standout) and suitably detailed locations although the occasional framerate hitch can pull you out. The acting and writing swings from excellent to laughably terrible. It's hard to tell how self aware everyone was as the subject matter is treated seriously even though a scene could be two girls literally shouting &#34;SLUT! WHORE&#34; for five minutes. Again, standard teenage horror movie fare.I hesitated to pull the trigger at $60 but Until Dawn is a surprisingly content rich game. If you're going for 100% you've got 16+ hours ahead of you. People put off by titles like Telltale's The Walking Dead or Life is Strange won't find much to but both horror fans and adventure game fans will be right at home. dad said 59.96 too overprice movie so we went to walmart to get some actually GOOD MOVIElike World War Z now that good horror movie with actually PLOT... I only had $27 or mayb #23 for aloowance so I got some actually good movie and some pizza instaid.  Once price drop I might get Until Don it probably not an undeprice movie at about $  20 or maybe 15.  Thanks for review but wait until themovie drops and is underprice THEN it might get more stars thanks this is a really fun game even with two people in the room the graphics are amazing and has multiple endings something you can play over and over and even want someone else play a must own for ps4 players This game totally reminds me of those books I read as a kid. You get to choose how the story unfolds...  I picked it up yesterday and played all night! This game sticks you in a horror movie. You have the ability to control the different friends in the group, as well as really put your personality into the game by choosing what happens next. I think you will really love this if you enjoyed games like Heavy Rain or Beyond: Two Souls.The graphics are awesome, the story is so much fun, and you are in full control.  I can honestly say this is now my favorite PS4 game. The Last of Us Remastered has been bumped...  SURVIVORS: Sam, Emily, and Jessica  UPDATE: 8/28/15 I'm a woman, played this game by myself, and I live alone. BAD IDEA, lol! I was so scared to fall asleep last night after I beat the game. I would say it gave me a good 10 hours of gameplay. I started again this morning and I'm trying to make some different decisions to really test out whether or not if your choices change the outcome. I have stumbled across a few new scenes, as well as found a bunch of things I missed the first time playing. I'll write another update after I finish.  SURVIVORS: Chris, Ashley, and Emily.  FINAL CONCLUSION:  I think this is a solid game that gives a good scare. I think people misunderstood when they pitched the game as having total replay value because the story changes. The plot of the story doesn't change. However, the way the story unfolds does change. For example, Mike died early on in my game during the first time I played. The second time I made a decision that kept him alive a little longer. He ended up dying a little bit after that, but it was a totally new death. I'm assuming if he survived past that he would have another chance to die again later in the game. I understand what they meant now. Another thing I realized is that Emily is like a cockroach. You just can't kill the girl, lol    WOULD I RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND: Hell yes! I already have a friend that is borrowing it, and another 2 waiting for him to finish. This is basically &#34;Choose Your Own Adventure&#34; - like the old adventure paperbacks that would give you a choice and then you'd turn to the directed page.  Classy graphics, but this is more of an interactive movie rather than any form of adventure game.  You will go long stretches without using the controller at all.. just watching the movie.  Think cheesy horror movie with kids in the woods and that's the premise. Camera angles can't be changed and the angles given are &#34;cinematic&#34; not the best angles. This is not an open sandbox and is fairly linear in play.  This is a movie where you make decisions that affect the characters. This game reminds me of an old horror film. Bad acting and terrible cheesy plot. The only thing this game has goin for it, basically its graphics, but still can't keep a soild frame rate. Which is inexcusable. There nothing going on to begin with. Sony plez stop making a movie with button prompts. Its getting old already. Fun unique game. Solid flow to the game even with quick time events. Graphics are amazing as well. I have been keeping an eye on the progress of this game for years and am so excited to finally play it. It has lived up to and beat my expectations and while similar games have been here before, none have come close to the creepy atmosphere and scare factor.At first, I was a little worried there would be far too much dialog and basically \\\\\"watching\\\\\" a game. However once the story is set and you are introduced to the characters, the game takes off and doesn't stop. This is an edge of your seat game that doesn't quit and you must force yourself to take a break. It is literately like watching a horror or sci-fi movie which you cannot wait to see what happens.Like similar games, the camera angles can be bothersome or annoying if you are trying to look in a different direction yet the camera forces you to look at what the game director wants you to look at.Over-all, it is a very smooth-running, great looking game. My wife and I stayed up all night playing it and tried to make the best choices in the game, however every choice has a different outcome. Some decisions we initially thought was incorrect, however it had a negative outcome.Great game, I see playing this at least 5-8 times as there are 8 main characters and there are so many options and outcomes. Very highly recommended!!! Game is pretty good, you pretty much watch a live movie with choices that need to be made either slow or quickly depending on the situation and you watch the out come.  This game isn't for people who love controlling his or her character like Resident Evil.  The graphics are pretty good along with the voice acting.  You can really tell who the real life actors are through there characters faces.  If you honest with the shrink, which you visit in between chapters, the game is that much more better.  I feel like I'm getting ready for a trip in Total Recall, they said the same thing be honest you will enjoy your trip better. If you like older horror movies then this is your game. There is a lot more to this game than what I initially thought. All the great horror elements are here. Seriously, I don't want to say exactly what is encountered in this game, but it's a very satisfying survival horror experience with much more than just a killer running around slaughtering people. It is a very &#34;interactive&#34; game. I see other reviews comparing to telltale type games and Heavy Rain. This is absolutely true,  but in my opinion this is better on almost every level. Great graphics, great story, great characters, fantastic acting,  great horror, great game.  For the diehard survival horror fans, this game is not all that scary. If your looking for the scariest game ever, this is nowhere close.  But that is fine because it is still a great game that is both unique and cliche at the same time with respect to the &#34;horror&#34; genre.  Note: if you don't like interactive games that are very story driven then this might not be for you. This game is amazing. At certain points, it literally had me jumping (and I'm not one to usually fall for jump scares). The story of riveting, and the acting is phenomenal. The choices you make really do determine how the story will play out. There was no &#34;wrong decision,&#34; but instead, decisions that you would make for yourself if you were in the characters' shoes. I've gone through and played it twice already (and will probably play it numerous more times). If you're a lover of everything slasher/horror like I am, then this game is a must buy. This game has been great so far (2 hours in). I find my self thinking hard about each choice I make (even though I know I'll play threw a couple of times). Graphics are amazing, love that they used proven actors for the characters, especially the Dr. Butterfly effect has been awesome but I don't want to give away to much information. Would have gave this game 5 stars if it wasn't $60 as it's still mostly just a QT game but if it was $40 I would easily give it 5 stars. A must have game but if you're tight on cash wait for a price drop you won't regret it. Fun to play, easy to play, great teen slasher story. its not just a game! It's a psychological evaluation!It's a cool game so far. I recommend motion control option with game play.I could see myself playing this again and again, just to see how different the story changes.Of course my first play through, everyone must DIE! I just completed the game, and I thought I would post a review for all. It took me a total of 6 hours and 23 minutes to beat the game. You can go back and replay the game for different out comes. The game has the best graphics I've seen on PS4. I thought I was playing a movie and I thought it was amazing to view. I think the game was great, but the current price is too much. I rarely replay games once I beat them. I have so many games that I need to play. I would suggest getting this from RedBox and try it out. I paid 3.00 to rent it, and beat it in one day. If you don't have a RedBox wait for the price to drop to 29.99-39.99. It was a fun game. I jumped many times in a game and I never do that. Like I said it could have been a 5 part series like Life is strange or the walking dead. However you don't have to wait months and months for the next part. Hope this review helped you all and enjoy the game. :) Love it great game but need more gameplay first horror game on next gen good job Sony Pretentious crap. Do not buy for more than $10-$20.Pros:The facial animationsEnvironmental detailsSoundsThe beginning - Chapter 5, good pacingThe mystery/the build upCons:Josh is the guy in the maskWendigos are real and ruined the game for meJosh being the guy in the mask, and pulling pranks ruined the game for meInteractive movie goes on for way too long, and I had to force myself to complete itA lot of padding to justify $60 price tagHannah being a wendigoJosh's insanity is annoying, it gets on your nerves after a whileThe characters movements, they are very weird. Especially in the beginning of the game, very jerky and spasticMy biggest complaint is Emily, her character is absolutely disgustingly detestable to me. From the moment she lied to matt to go hug up on Mike and got jealous at Jessica she ticked me off bad. She is an absolute Witch, and you know what I really mean. I can not stand her. Her voice grates on my nerves. No one character in history has made me want to track down and punch the actor in the face like Emily. She is nagging, annoying, bossy, and witchy. Matt could have done way better than Emily.The events of the past were annoying too, they were just static and the same few seconds over and over minus nearing the end.The totem aspect should have been left out of the game.They were too easy to find, and you would have to constantly check them so often to remember what to look out for. The game was too huge for the totems to be used properly.For me the replayability is not there. The story is not good enough to make me want to sit through it again to see the different outcomes. Maybe see the different outcomes on youtube.The wendigos look like Jack Skeletons from the nightmare before christmas mixed with Gollum from Lord of the RingsJosh becomes a wendigoThe last hour of the game becomes the last of us esque while retaining it's weird interactive movie mechanics. I honestly did not like itThe cheerleader from heroes does not get nakedI would really recommend this game for $10-$20. This game would have been better as a slasher version of Heavy Rain. But there is no real slasher killer and the goofy wendigo creatures are off putting. You know what? Just watch youtube walkthroughs, don't waste your money unless you are super rich and can do that. Save your money. Gamestop/Craigslist here I come to sell this crappy interactive movie game.le retaining it's weird interactive movie mechanics.

Save your money. Gamestop/Craigslist here I come to sell this crappy interactive movie game. The graphic alone make this game stand out, but what I particularly loved about this a was the story. If you loved heavy rain or even the telltale games, you will LOVE this! My only con was the incorporation of the shrink, but I am only knit picking. Overall, one of my top as of 2015 so far. I love it! Most Fascinating if you dont like it because you dont play this type of game heavy rain game i could think thats kinda like this and a few others sorry xbox  only on ps4 So far, the only complaint I have on this game would be the horrible camera angles, which I guess are supposed to be &#34;part&#34; of the cinematic experience. In short, a lot of camera angles will make your character walk like a drunk man.Aside from that, I'm enjoying how little things can make an impact on the game. Without putting in any spoilers, the choices you make as each person effect how others see them. Mike's girlfriend will see him as a brave hero or a cowardly child depending on a couple of choices. Each aspect of a character has several levels, as well as several levels of their relationship with each person.I believe I'm in Chapter 4 right now, and aside from having to stop to charge the controller, I'm loving going back into the 80's horror genre, and can't wait to see how the opposite choices will effect my next run. Completely love the game, well worth the wait! Until Dawn is what Telltale should strive for. Its got a great presentation, great characters and in parts can be actually scary. Until Dawn is a fun experience that had me smiling, laughing and jumping the whole time. Great game! If you are a horror fan this is definitely worth picking up. No need of a game being thi immatre.  be careful if your kids are playing this.  I heard it's just an interactive movie and I think that it should be out on other platforms as well not just ps4 Basically, this game relies HEAVILY on story.  (obviously)  There really isn't much &#34;gameplay&#34; in the sense of the traditional style, that is.  Regardless, if you have ever played, and enjoyed, &#34;Heavy Rain&#34; you'll know that story is the ultimate factor in a game.  That being said, this game is just that.  It's one giant, interactive, Horror movie.  This is the game that &#34;Night Trap&#34; was to become.  You follow eight friends back to the location of a terrible accident that happened a year prior.  You must survivor &#34;until dawn&#34;.  Clever?  I think so.Anyways, nearly every decision you make has some sort of impact on your playing experience.  This leads to countless replays, in my opinion.  I'm such a horror fan that I want to know EVERYTHING that is possible.  Of course, I was the same way playing Heavy Rain, so.  I absolutely love these types of games, as they put you into the atmosphere perfectly and you really feel as if you're one of the characters.  The characters, are portrayed perfectly by their respective real life counterpart.I can't give this game enough praise.  I just wish I could start all over again without ANY knowledge of what's going to happen.Final Verdict:  I you're into this type of game, you can't go wrong.  If you are a sucker for &#34;action&#34;, this might not be for you. Wow! Until Dawn has to be one of the best horror games I've ever played. The graphics are some of the best I've ever seen, and adds to the realism of the game. Until Dawn actually tailors the game to you, and what you fear most. Every single choice you make can change that characters relationship with someone else, change that characters characteristics, or lead that character or another character to danger/death.Ignore all the haters. Either they are Xbone fans who are jealous they can't get this game, or childish kids who only like games like COD, and don't care for the story. WHEN I SAY THISYOU SAY SUCKSTHISSUCKSTHISSUCKSWith that out of the way, Until Dawn is yet another Interactive Movie that Sony tried to pass off as a game. While the graphics are decent looking, it does not make up for terrible atmosphere and and sub par characters.  These characters are not memorable, did not feel any connection, prob only to the killer. I do not need to say more about the game play. Push this, get this scene. Push that, get a different scene. Yawn. Just wait until it comes to netflix. 256 ends??? If you loved Heavy Rain and really enjoy horror, I'd recommend this. Until Dawn is a solid experience Chilling, well acted and with a lot of jump scares. It's just like watching a scary '80s-'90s horror movie (very much an homage to classics such as Scream, The Descent, Saw, or The Cabin In The Woods), but you control the action, and this &quot;movie&quot; is over 8 hours long. Although the game mechanics are very different, in terms of theme, quality, and how each playthrough can result in different characters surviving, it's similar to the classic Xbox 360 game &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;.The first few minutes really gets you emotionally involved in the plot, and while the plot setup is a bit forced, it works in terms of the scary movie genre that the game is paying homage to. The introduction is slow-paced (not for those with a short attention span), but for the rest of us, the tension starts right away, and it does not let up for a moment. The game really gets the atmosphere right. Also, you care for each character, and while it's true that some of them are not wholly likeable (in horror movie tradition, some are immature and they can be unkind, self-centered or unthinking), you really feel as if you want to get them all through the horror that is about to overtake them.The game controls are simple, intuitive and effective, and movement is smooth. The graphics are amazing, from the facial textures to the snowfall, lighting and shadows, this game really takes advantage of this latest generation of consoles to bring out detail and atmosphere. Music is very atmospheric and extremely well integrated into the action. The clues and collectibles in the game are very effective, and the in-game menus work well to help the player assess how well he is doing. During the action sequences, the player needs to make split-second decisions and controller inputs, and in my opinion (speaking as an older but experienced gamer) these are perfectly balanced to appeal to players of most abilities.Replay value is wholly focused on survival, not on a branching plot. This is not a bad thing: while the overarching plot remains fixed, the fate of each character is very much decided by your actions and choices: any character or all of them can die. Conversely, any or all can be saved, but saving everyone is very hard: I only saved two of the eight characters the first time around (Sam and Emily). I'm looking forward to restarting in the hope that I can somehow get at least a few more people through &quot;until dawn&quot;.The most innovative aspect of the game is &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;: a build-up of small, seemingly insignificant changes that may have devastating consequences down the line. This feature shows itself even in the first play through, as an in-game menu screen tells you which decisions you've made and gives subtle hints as to how you're doing. It's not just the illusion of choice - if you mess up too often, friends may become enemies, making it harder for characters to survive. Sometimes, a small mistake will be recoverable, but the mistakes do mount up, and sometimes the choices made leave no way out. At the game's end the sun rises, but who will be there to see it is up to you.My only criticisms so far (all but the first one are very minor nitpicks):1: It's a PS4 exclusive. I know, it's just business, but I think everyone should be able to play it on whatever platform they happen to own. Sony's sales of their console should be based on how good their hardware is, not on how many games they can offer as exclusives.2: The camera sometimes doesn't feel as if it's showing enough of the scenes, and it can make movement tricky in darker areas, but then again, that may be a conscious decision because of the need for a survival horror game to be claustrophobic.3: The voices are sometimes out of sync with the characters' mouth movements (happens a lot when replaying chapters).4: The characters' heads seem kinda wobbly at some points (it's obvious during the map scene in the basement). It's very subtle, but it is noticeable.5. There is no way to adjust the screen size in the game - on my TV it's still playable, but some items on the screen edges are clipped.6. The pre-order DLC is just a small inconsequential scene tacked on to the end of chapter 2. It's almost like a deleted scene in a movie and it kinda messes with the pacing. I was kind of expecting a little more.7. Each character's menu screen shows how that character is getting along with the others, but while this is nice, it isn't really clear how this is factored into game play or how (or if) you can rebuild a faltering relationship. On the other hand, maybe making it too clear would make the game too easy.Common criticisms I've seen:1. It's &quot;just&quot; an interactive movie. Okay, even if that were the case, so what? It's a great experience and a lot of fun. But the criticism has no merit - unlike most interactive movies, this one keeps the player fully engaged. At no time did I feel like I could sit back, uninvolved, and just watch the drama play out.2. Two of the characters are predestined to get to the final scene. The developers sometimes mask this with quick time events that focus on saving other characters. Is this a flaw? I'm not sure. However, I think it's a better solution than the alternative, which is a game that would end very quickly for less skilled players.Pre-release hype for this game was unaccountably low. At a guess, Sony's marketing team just didn't know how to sell the game, so it received the minimum pre-release advertising. I'm guessing some marketing executives are being slowly tortured to death in Sony's secret underground lair.Altogether, I had a blast with this game, and I think a lot of other players will too, even if this type of game is not their usual fare. For me, this is not just one of the best survival horror games I've ever played, but if it were a movie, I'd say it would be the best horror movie since The Cabin in the Woods. Yeah, it's that good. I will be very surprised if this game doesn't gather a few of the most prestigious Game of the Year awards.e map scene in the basement). It's very subtle, but it is noticeable.5.

My brother purchased the game. And the story is great A horror film material.  I recommend purchasing from amazon. I always do because I have prime and its free shipping and receive same day release. So much fun, the cliche horror film with tremendous butterfly effect storyline. I'm not sure why people would complain about the gameplay, it's exactly what it was marketed as. Overall, great! Very good game Great game with multiple endings. Another classic from Sony. Better than any Xbone game to date. Awesome game best graphics I ever seen and so realistic I got pre-order this at Gamestop then got it but I am reviewing it here. Its really not what I expected, its more of a Telltale Game because there is no real game experience its an Interactive story, doesn't mean its a bad gaming experience because it's not I pulled an All Nighter and finished it. Do I wish I played something else? Yes. Was the story good? Decent. Would I recommend it? Not unless your in to these types of games. I'm not sure that I am going to hear people talking about this game at the quad or my dorm. Overall it wasn't what I expected but if you are in too the Interactive type games this is for you. If you liked Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, or any of the TellTale games, this will be right up your alley.  Plus this is also one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen! Until Dawn is an interactive, story based horror adventure game.  The narrative is well written and is inspired by the 80's and 90's &#34;slasher&#34; horror films (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Saw) as well as supernatural horror.  From the beginning, the characters and the setting are intentionally stereotypical: A group of upper/middle class teenagers in an isolated region of the country side.  Even the character archetypes are all reminiscent of the typical horror flicks that are released around October: The jock, the clown, the arrogant cheerleader, the attractive 'nerdy' girl, the token minority, etc..  The setting for the story is designed in such a way to induce a constant feeling of isolation in the player. Add to this the excellent ambient sound quality plus the top-notch graphics (even by the standards of a PC gamer), and you have for yourself one atmospheric and engaging adventure game.  UD is simply much more than &#34;just another interactive movie.&#34; This is because the optional element of exploration not only fleshes out the details of the main story, but can potentially change its course with regards to death/survival of each character.  Simply put, the more one explores the various dark and eerie areas, the more he/she will feel rewarded.  Another aspect of the game is the knowledge that even the smallest decisions can have drastic consequences.  I will not go into too much detail regarding this &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34; for the sake of keeping the review as spoiler-free as possible.  Suffice to say, it is intended to make the player ponder his/her every move and adds replayability to the game.  What UD isn't:  The horror elements in this game are based on the aforementioned movie genre.  Hence, you will witness elements of gore, jump scares, eerie music, mystery, etc...  Do not expect the same type of horror as in games such as Amnesia or Condemned.  The game is also heavily story-driven with simple control mechanics.  The gameplay is not meantto be complex or challenging.  Pros: -Well-written, engaging story -Multiple characters with distinct personalities -Atmospheric and immersive environments -Exploration is rewarding and helps to flesh out the story -Multiple playthroughs yield different outcomes  Cons: -occasional frame rate drops. -Simple gameplay mechanics could possibly turn off the more hardcore gamer -Some might initially find the story/characters too cliche. Great game! Very realistic as if you're really in it! Just throw on some 7.1 surround sound headphones and you're in! I pre ordered the digital copy which was playable by 11pm. I recommend this game! If i could give more than 5 stars. I would! Until Dawn is brilliant! The story is really interesting, the graphics are wonderful, and so many different choices can lead to multiple playthroughs. Was very excited to play this game. I have heard nothing but great reviews, and I enjoy it when games decide to try and rip off the walking dead.Sadly, this game is very scary, and midway through the game I saw a pair of speakers and instantly I got reminded of when I was in battle in 1845 with general cornhog with nothing but a crowbar.The great battle of speakers was in full view; everywhere I looked the speakers were trying to take over the world and it was up to us, and the pigs of Africa, to take back the land. In the end 230,948 speakers died in the process.It was not until 1990 when radio shack game along and made peace with the speakers.Anyway the game is terrible 0/6 stars I hope you enjoyed my review. Great game got it today amazon is always good with shipments I really wish I pre-ordered this game because it was a hard time to find the actual game at a store. I went through a Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and then finally ended at another GameStop where they had only three copies left in stock (I had to call ahead to reserve one).Anyways, when I finally got home and popped the disc into my PS4, I was already getting anxious whenever I stumbled upon the main menu. The music of the game was already immersing me into the eerie state of the story, I had goosebumps of an incoming fear.I haven't completed the game yet but after playing through about an hour of it, I'm already amazed. I think the last time I jumped so much was when I played P.T. for the first (Silent Hills Playable Teaser). There was one scene where my wireless headset almost broke because I literally flew out of my chair in fear and my headset went flying off my head (thankfully my soft carpet broke its fall), but make sure you bring extra pairs of underwear before hitting &#34;New Game&#34; on the main menu.A feature I really like about the game is how you can see how a character's relationship with another character changes as you make decisions along the story that effect that character.In the final verdict, I recommend this game to anyone who loves the horror genre in general. Someone who loves getting scared by endless jump-scares, following along the personalities of a variety of characters, and being immersed into a story that makes you think and sit at the edge of your chair. P.S. Seriously, at least consider my underwear advise. This is a story mode game. Similar to Heavy Rain in that regard. It's fun, it's creepy, and has great replay capabilities. Great graphics, very good story. Let the choices begin... Until dawn is its own kind of game sure at first glace it my seem like a typical horror game but that is far from the case until dawn is amazing with a beautiful style of gameplay gorgeous graphics, amazing characters (Ashley being my favorite) it brings amazing life to the horror genre that has gone stale and old over the years that being Teen slasher flims it plays great homage to that genre and with so many many choices to choose from in the game this game has great replay value. Until dawn is a game that should definitely not be missed for Amy horror fans or ps4 owners", "Amazing game with amazing story It froze on me and stopped working had to get a refund This was the 1st game I played on the xbox one.  I was blown away by the graphics and I like this Far Cry even better than FC3.  Spectacular scenery and outdoor sounds that I just wanted to immerse in.  It does follow a formula seen in other Far Cry games, but that is ok with me.  This is some of gaming's best AI for making you feel like you are really being hunted down by pursuers.  This is Ubisoft, so there are lots of drug trips to Shangrila if you choose to do the side missions.  Those scenes are spectacularly beautiful, but the gameplay there is so frantic you can hardly take it in.  The only thing I did not love was the ending with the procedural boss battle.  Voice acting is Hollywood quality.  Watch out for the freakin rhinos--they don't give up once riled.  :) This game is very fun.  I am usually more of a multiplayer gamer but this game has it all: gameplay, story, good coop, map editing.  The PVP multiplayer isn't that fun but you won't care.  I would highly recommend this game to anyone who like fun shooter games and open world games.  I would absolutely buy again. Great game. Loved it from the begining to the end!!! Great game, a little repetitive, but none the less lots of fun.", "A kickass special edition package for a great game. An excellent adventure in the Persona universe, and the additional merchandise is wonderful for any Persona fan (soundtracks especially are a MUST for any Atlus game; Persona being no exception).", "i've bought 2 units of this product. first one came fine and i am still using it, so i ordered another for my laptop. it came in like a week ago but i opened it today. it is not working and it looks used to. i know they will refund it, but it is another painful work. I like it! The price is good! Works well! Great mouse love it! Mouse is awesome but there were no instructions or anything for that matter in the box and we had to search online to figure out how to use it.  No warranty I guess? Works as advertised.  Easy to set up and use--hope it continues to perform....if it dies before the warranty period, I'll be unhappy! Good value....in a word, I'd say pleased.  Packaging and delivery was perfect. Works fine for our needs. Been using this mouse for over month and haven't had any problems with it yet. The only complaint I have is this mouse replaced the small logitech mouse that came with the keyboard. It's really not a full size mouse and only marginally bigger than the mouse it's replacing. However, it conforms with the hand better and generally feels better to use so that makes up for it. Feels a little on the cheap side. Dpi button works well. Love the automatic shutoff and sleep Works well! Several buttons to do different tasks - and they all work well. I haven't figured them all out yet (and hint to manufacturer: the instructions don't tell us what they do!) Love it! Good mouse, cheap price, great condition when I got it. Nothing to complain about!! better than expected Love this mouse, am using it as of right now. Fast response time and prompt shipping! Great mouse for the money. Works great & feels good in your hand. No complaints at all! Plan to buy more. Mouse works great BUT IT DID NOT COME WITH DIRECTIONS. Which is fine...but to get it to work I had to spend 30 minutes googling an instruction manual...which DOES NOT EXIST. I found review on amazon that finally showed me how to work it:After plugging in USB and installing drivers, hold down scroll button and right click at the same time for 10 seconds. Viola!Why would they not add instructions? Who would've ever guessed that setup? Works fine though. Add instructions to package and I will upgrade to 5 stars. Great. Feels good in my hand, is responsive, has a long battery life. I love the idea of the automatic shut off I was expecting a ON/OFF switch in mouse to save battery. convenient So far so good. Loved the mouse, works perfectly for me. Perfect size for my hand, a little on the bigger side compared to the vast majortiy of mouses I've seen (tiny in general). Also like how i can change the settings for the sensitivity. For only $8? This was a bargain. An absolute bargain, I love it and if anything was to happen to it, I'd definitively be buying another one.Note: Almost gave it one stars out of the box because I couldn't get it to work, just plug-n-play like it says. However, I read in another review that you needed to press the scroll and right buttons for ten seconds. I tried it out, and lo and behold! Started working like a charm. Would wish the company put that in some sort of instructions somewhere instead of having us fumble around. Apart from that tiny inconvenience at the start? Perfect. Works very well. I am not sure what the extra buttons do. I had hoped it would be a little smaller. Easy to change battery. Turns off when not in use", "Though I would like it but seemed cheap when I got it in the mail. Good product Couldn't get any easier i just plug it in my computer my computer automatic downloaded the drivers after that download my controller just connected with no problem. if your game supports controllers its going to work just remember some games don't support controllers Very convenient one battery pack was broken, its not charging but after that its a very great item Works great! Product is my second unit.  They work well for charging Xbox controllers quality built In theory this is a good product for a reasonable price. However when we first got the product it was having issues charging... You'd put the controller on the station and it wouldn't be recognized unless you messed with it. I called Nyko's customer service countless times and there was only an answering machine. No answer, and no matter how many messages I left I never received a callback.Eventually the batteries started charging as soon as you put the controller on the station. The charge never lasted for long, but it was serviceable. Within a couple of months the batteries stopped holding a charge for more than an hour of use. Now, within a few minutes of begging the charging, the station says the batteries are charged. But, within a half hour they're both dead.Because if this experience I'd never buy another Nyko product. Saves us sooooo many batteries! Works great!", "I played the 360 version and enjoy the heck out of thr series but this just brought the game up to the level we always wanted it to be. Great game for those of you who like third person adventure. This game is satisfying and challenging, Give it a try This game was amazing! I've played the first one, and I must say that this game is a vast improvement in so many ways! The controls and gameplay feel a lot more fluid, the sheer amount of weapons and items is impressive, and there's so much variety to be had that replay value is phenomenal! As vague as all this is, if you've played the first and enjoyed it, I highly recommend this. If you've played Dark Souls II and are curious is this enhancement is worth it, I have friends who have played it and will agree that it is a vast improvement and, with the addition of all DLC, say that this is well worth the price. If you're new to Dark Souls and wish to jump in here, I say this is as good a spot as any if you don't have any interesting in playing the first. The lore remains the same, but the story isn't connected (contradiction? you bet!) so you won't be missing much if you're just heading in.TL;DR -- Great game that's worth the price for new and returning players (DS1 & DS2).", "Don't like at all not happy happy just sad sad Worked great for the first 2 weeks. Suddenly, one day of playing Zelda, the joystick breaks. It works ok, but the analog stick isn't as loose as I generally like it to be.", "I enjoyed th game, But it was easy to beat. Everything was great", "Did not work could not return It plays good", "a lot more comfortable and responsive than any other controllers out there, even the original Nintendo GC controller I destroy kids with this controller, 5/5. Nice product This controller was used.the thumb pad was already worn away. And it didn't take long for it to be, just slightly, unresponsive. Still works well though, but not for fighting games where timing is everything Works for Wii, Gamecube and WiiU. Very satisfied :) Great cheap controller from nintendo Works as intended. Longer cord than original which is very appreciated Great product. I have been playing with this controller for around a month and it is fantatstic.", "My husband and I played this when we were younger on the Nintendo Cube. It's the same wonderful amazing game!! The interface is actually even easier to do then the original which is always a perk. So glad Nintendo renewed this game :) Thanks I loved this game as a child and I still love it today!!! Great! Excellent game and the graphics are better than the original. This is the must have game for the 3DS. It is still the best game of all time in my heart.  Very impressed with the Sunday shipping! Great game Love the game The game that redefined history. I could write about it forever. But keeping it short:-- Amazing remastering of graphics- Impeccable 3D- Beautiful soundtrack (it made me take up the ocarina as an instrument)- The best storyline of any video game everThe game has no flaws! BUY IT! (It might be cheaper on the Nintendo Store though, like $33) Amazing game one of the best I've ever played!", "Works Great! Only thing I don't like about these is that the comparable model for the PS4 is $30 bucks less.  But there is no fully wireless competition at this price point, so can't blame TB.  Solid product. Sound: Great, Crystal clear audio. I play Evolve, and hearing the monster rustling around now is way easier, I'm hearing sounds and environments I had no idea they were there.Mic: Quality is great, everybody can hear me with perfect clarity.Weight: these are light, not super light, but they can be on your head for 3-4 hours comfortably.Battery:  No problems with battery yet, but I haven't run out yet. You charge it via micro Usb.Design: They look cool!Suggestions:They should come with a mic stand After two lousy experiences with Turtle Beach, I bit the bullet and bought these. I'm shocked by how much better this unit is than the others.I had a Turtle Beach 800X on my original Xbox and it was a love/hate relationship. Much of the hate was that it was tied to a massive base station for charging and that it completely failed me (even with purchased converters) when I tried to move it to the Xbox One.For my birthday this year, my wife bought me the 500X. The offering seemed great, but it was issue after issue. After feedback through the mic, I updated it per support instructions. It then lost complete mic ability. Support then lead me through a factory reset and re-update. It worked for a week, then just plain wouldn't turn on. I returned it for a refund and cursed Turtle Beach thoroughly.After much research, I couldn't find a decent option, so I decided to give the 420X, which had just released, a chance. Wow, am I happy I did.Pros:- Good sound and clarity- It charges from any outlet with a USB adapter, so I can keep it near my sofa instead of at my console 15 feet away.- There is no massive base station. It's a simple USB thumb drive sized adapter.- Literally plug and play. Plug the USB adapter into the Xbox, wait a few seconds and you're on. No changing settings, no updates, nothing.- The buttons are laid out well, and simple to use.- All of the things the box says. It's fully wireless, has a good battery, mic monitoring, etc.Cons:- I really haven't found any. I guess the sound could be a bit better, but that's really it. I wasn't expecting Sennheiser quality, so it met my expectations. Bought this due to the reputation of Turtle Beach combined with the freedom of a wireless headset. Product arrived and works as advertised.Head size is 7 5/8's and so this is slightly snug. I'd say my cranium size is the limit for this item, so those who possess bigger noggins beware! The volume dials are finicky - as I dial, it will have dead spots where I only hear silence before getting bum rushed by tons of volume. Or no volume. Either way.I can hear others in the room with me when I game, but it's not annoying - rather it's good if you need to have some awareness of pets or children getting into trouble. The mic pics up sound well, and the voice monitoring function works but it's hard to tell if it's picking up other noises which are the bane of gamers, such as breathing, smacking of lips, chewing...if you're a squeaker, it will not fix that.I'd buy again, especially if you're not willing to make the jump to surround - which honestly, I'm not missing since this stereo sound is good enough. Great gaming headset. One of my lights on the headset doesn't work but sound does so I'm not complaining. It's completely wireless and the sound is on point. I would definitely recommend to a friend The sound quality is amazing.  I felt like the game I was playing was a brand new game.  I wasn't too fond of the name at first because I don't smoke and I'm not into the whole 420 thing, but it is the best looking wireless headset so that's what made me buy it.  I contacted Turtle Beach to see if this has the super human hearing feature and it doesn't.  It still sounds really clear.  I posted that it wasn't good for music at first, but then I looked at my computer's sound preferences and the slider was moved to the right.  When I centered it, the music quality is great.  Made me change from 4 stars to 5.  Now I love this headset even more.  For the price, design, and it being wireless. This is a good buy.  I bought the Turtle Beach stand to go along with it too.  Some things I would change up.  1.  Change the model name (420x).  Not all of us are potheads. 2.  Add the superhuman hearing feature  That's about it.  I'm happy with my headset.", "I have ALWAYS adored the AC franchise and will continue to support Ubisoft for a long time to come. Let's face it, there are A LOT of Assassin's Creed games! My game shelf was over flowing so I decided to clean things up a bit, therfore, I sold my &#34;AC3 - AC4&#34; games to purchase this set. ( I had never owned AC Liberation before) It's cheaper and more convenient than buying each game separate for the new buyers! I guess the only thing I'm surprised were not included were the Expansion Packs/DLC for each game. These are NOT new games (AC 4 might be an acception) so I am somewhat surprised that Ubisoft continue to make players pay for these old expansion packs. Very fast delivery! The game is great! Love the fact you can download and not have a disk to worry about.", "Does what it supposed to do. So far no problems. Good price. If it worked, it'd be great. I plugged it in and neither port works for either controller.  It glows brightly and the controllers don't charge at all. Just like this design... The added color changing along with the ability to charge 2 controlers... Low profile design... Aesthetic value I give 5 stars Great Shipped fast works well, lights aren't too bright so it doesn't interfere, happy purchase Got this for about $8 with a discount code and I'm completely satisfied with this product. If you're looking for a cheap but effective charging station, look no further. The controllers slide into place effortlessly, which is nice, and the gradually changing colors of the light bar are easy on the eyes. That said, the light can be fairly bright in a dark room, which might be distracting for some people, but you can always unplug it if that's a problem. Upon purchase, I assumed that the light bar would change from red to green to blue, which is does for a short time, but it eventually changes its pattern altogether providing an almost flowing or rolling spectrum of color. Product did not charge from one of the ports. Out of the other port it overcharged and ruined my Playstation 4 controller. Controller was extremely hot after I checked to see if it was charged. Lights no longer work on controller. Controller will stay on for about 1-2 seconds. Previously no issues with controller.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM. Works great, looks cool, keeps the remotes from getting strewn around the room. Would buy it again. Works well with the standard PS4 controllers, but not with the newer ones.  Couldn't get the newer model controller to stay on.  Would definitely suggest for those with the standard black controllers as the colorful base is a great addition to the room. gets the job done, looks really nice at night", "my friend love it for his ps4 pad Works as advertised.Keeps me from leaving controllers lying all over the place, keeps them charged, and looks good doing it! This is a great charging system for our controllers.  I have a couple cats that love chewing on USB / charging cables.  We did not want the clutter or the risk of chewed cables by charging our controllers with USB cables.  This dock works great.  The design is self-centering.  The key is to place the controller in the cradle and let it rest which perfectly centers the controller in the cradle.  Then press down on top of the controller to activate the spring loaded charging cradle.  When it is time to remove the controller, press down on top of the controller to deactivate the spring loaded charging cradle and then remove the controller.It would be easy to try and insert and later remove the controller as a single motion but you might not get the flawless action that way -and may risk damage to your controller or the charger.  I think some of the bad reviews are from people attempting this instead of the two-step method of first letting the controller rest in the cradle and then pressing down to activate the charger.One of the best features of this unit is it does not use the front USB ports of the PS4.  This is a deal breaker of other charger designs when you need to use the PS4 USB ports for other things like the wireless headset dongles. Arrived promptly. The product is nice and compact and my boyfriend loves it. This thing is SWEET!  I was very impressed by the way this product &#34;connects&#34; the control to begin charging.  Back with my PS3, I had purchased a charging deck ([[ASIN:B00HGSLCTW New USB Charge Double Deck for PS3 Dual Shock Controller Charger]]) that required you to perfectly position the controllers into the slots so they would plug into the mini usb inputs.  While not being difficult to do, this sometimes took more time than it should because there was NO margin for error.  THIS charger uses the &#34;headphone&#34; input and simply requires you to rest the controller on the deck and &#34;click&#34; in down into place.  Simple as can be and I believe this will add to the life of controllers!  Couldn't be happier! Works great! Broke nine months later. The spring mechanism that holds the controller in the charging position broke so I had to put a heavy object on top of the controller so it would charge. Worked fine before that. Now I purchased the Nyko Modular charger. Works great These have saved me from using a short cord! This sucker plugs into the wall or any outlet and will keep your controllers charged. A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE. This product is very nice and the service too. Great item! Lights up when charging and keeps me organized! Works great! Very clumsy and flimsy.. i don't use it anymore. A bit flimsy, and the locking mechanism weakens very quickly. Definitely worth the cheap price, but know it's very light weight material. I love this thing. I wish I bought this way sooner. I was living with my controller constantly needing to be charged. Now with this my controller is never dead. I just put it on and next time I want to play I have a full charge. No need to leave my ps4 in rest mode. It's really easy to put the controller on. You just set in on top, let it slide into place and press down. The light on the controller flashes until it has a full charge. To release you just push down and the controller pops up. Highly recommended Works great. Uses the lights on the controller to tell you when it's done. It feel a little flimsy because of the plastic stand. But it works well and fully charges the controller relatively fast. And it acts as a safe storage space. one side doesn't work. piece of junk It feels a little cheap and clunky, but gets the job done. It does not use the normal power charging port that the cable uses, but still magically works. While it lacks a charging indicator, the controller's light glows yellow while charging. Stop using the charging cable! This charging station is a must have for your PS4. I bought this and had never used a charging station. I have been missing out. Product works great and charges both controllers fast. It does take a few tries the first time to connect the controller to the charging port. Great product, highly recommend. Had this thing for 3 months and both sides died and won't even charge anymore. Ill have my controllers in for 2 - 3 days, and the orange charging light never turns off. taking my controller off the stand, turning it on finding that theres only 1 bar of battery left...what a joke. its not an uncommon problem apparently, if you look at all the one star reviews, it's people with this problem of at least one side dying early. When I bought this I only had one controller and it seemed to work perfectly....3 months later I finally found a good deal on a second controller and found out that only one side actually charges. Return policy says that my time to return has expired.... Picked this up on a whim and it's easily become the most used accessory I own. Charge two controllers, no USB cords sticking out of the Ps4. Works great, looks great, get one. Works great so far. Way better than having wires hanging out of the front of the PS4. Nice, clean look. I really loved how the controllers plug into the top of the stand with an audible click sound. It makes it very easy to just pop your controller in and walk away after a gaming session. But after only a few weeks I discovered that the left side dock would not charge my controllers. That really bummed me out since I otherwise love this charger stand. It could have been busted right out of the box since I don't tend to use the second controller much, but I think it's too late to swap anyway. 1 star off for the non-standard connector used to power the device.  1 more star off for the flimsy design and lack of weight on the unit.  Will need to secure the base down using some additional method so that placing a controller on the base doesn't lead to tipping over and/or ruining the connectors of the unit or game pad.", "Ordered this for my cousin it works but not very well Sensor wouldn't do a full scan of the room with the zoom attachment, despite having more room than it said was the required minimum.  Tried several times with no luck. good", "If you are having issues you need to either update the mic or update your xboxone controller. I use this on my PS4,XB1,360 and ps3 for two years and have not had a single issue they are amazing. As someone who has had turtle beaches these are much more well designed. It seems undisputed that the sound quality in the ASTRO A50 is top-knotch for wireless gaming headsets.  They are the most comfortable headphones I've ever worn and often forget I even have them on sometimes.  They block out noise well and keep the sound of my games in.The primary issue I see people talking about is the microphone, and I haven't had any problems with my A50 (Gen1) OR the A50 Xbox One Edition with no echo.  I'm wondering if people have upgraded their firmware on their headphones or mixamp as that was a major problem with the Gen1 headsets.  (Even though it says the firmware is for A50, and doesn't specify XBox One, it's still the same firmware.)Once upgraded, my headphones have worked flawlessly.  Only problem that I have with them is that for PC it requires Optical Audio for the best sound, but fortunately my laptop has an SPDiF port.  Not everyone will, so make sure yours does. excellent headset. excellent quality, the battery life could be longer but I am very happy with this purchase.", "Delivered as pictured and on time I enjoyed the game but it was too easy to beat. Great product Good product. Fast delivery service. This game is garbage. If I wanted Halo, I would've bought Halo! ZERO game play improvement and it seems to me they just tried to create Halo.... Not a fan. The last Call of Duty somewhat rooted in reality. Received Sucks dont qaste ur money by MW 1,2 or 3 hell even black ops cuz only the campaign an extinction makes the game worth getting I wanted a cheap game and I wanted to get my first call of duty game. I like the story mode and the game is action packed. Would recommend to anyone who loves realistic first person shooters. Review from an 11 year old boy: I could not stop playing this, it's one of the funnest games I have ever had. I beat all the Lego, Skylander, and similar type games in a short time so my parents bought me this as a challenge. Even after beating it, it's still fun to play in Multi-Player online with my friends. Excellent Pretty good game. Bought it awhile after it came out though so the online is a little less open and can take some time to find a game but there are still plenty of players. Can hardly go wrong with a Call of Duty game and this one is no different. Would recommend!", "great Awesome game!", "Love it! Love it! Came in good condition with box undamaged.  The actual quality of the figure is what to expect from a 13 dollar toy, nothing too groundbreaking.  Honestly Palutena is one of the figures Nintendo should fix up later if reprints come around, specifically around the hand areas and just overall facial structure.  Nevertheless this is still a nice figure to have if you're a fan of Kid Icarus or Palutena herself as she does not have much merchandise out for her. came on time, no issues, looks great! Very satisfied, came in great condition. Gift, just want my son wanted. Nice quality and was packed very securely. Amazingly detailed Great but box had a slight crease in it.  Looking to re-sell it, but crease lowers the value. Perfect. Just what I ordered and expected. We love amiibo's! the item came in perfectly and quickly Perfect condition! Need to sell more for regular price Is nice A great Amiibo figure for any Kid Icarus fan and Smash Bros Fan. Good details, the only bad thing of this amiibo is its eyes, but in general terms it is pretty good looking. It came faster than I expected but there were cracks on the card box which I wasn't pleased with. It looked like somebody got the box and threw it at the wall. Everything else was okay, also I really liked how my Amiibo came out it looks great. Was actual able to get one. More detailed than expected. This made a good gift.  Website was surprisingly stable during release. Wonderful amiibo! Very nice looking amiibo She is super beautiful except for the man hands. Bought off amazon, came packaged with a lot of bubble wrap so came out perfect Was an adventura get the order of this article, but it worth. Perfect My favorite amiibo so far! Much more detailed than some of my other amiibos. For being an exclusive I thought it was going to be hard to get, but I got it and I love this amiibo so far . Love the item but package was damaged and the price was as much as an imported one Looks great, feels solid and arrived quickly. Looks grate Great!! I love it!! Party! Yes it was beautiful Nintendo figure.  My daughter love it and I love it too.  Amazon chose a good one to exclusive. Looks great Awesome Was pretty good the box was kind of dinged up a little that required some restoration on my behalf Great item It's a good looking amiibo. Greatly detailed and arrived in mint condition. A nice car\u00e1cter and very detailed, the painting is not the best but make it looks cool. thanks amazon very happy I love this item so very much. I treasure it as a trophy. The figure is so detailed and very beautiful. It was the first amiibo that I put in a special protective case and I plan to keep it safe and preserved for as long as I own it. I wish Amazon managed all of the exclusive Amiibos, painless experience.Palutena is a great figure, lots of details. You can tell there has been an improvement regarding the quality since wave 2. Really one of the prettier looking amiibos simply Amazing! Perfect condition. Great! Perfect. Shipped fast, backboard wasn't bent, packaged great. My expectations for amiibos are not high anymore but I was still disappointed with a couple things about this one. The mouth was off to the left, which makes her look kinda funny but it's still annoying, and the fingers on her left hand are fat. Palutena is beautiful much more better than expected. Came in perfect Cool Item came damaged Yup I received it damaged and was so down about this... only amiibo I don't have in mint condition! Very fast delivery, item has exceptional detail! This item was purchased for my daughter and she is very happy with her new amiibo Satisfaction 100% Was just what I wanted I love it came in with perfect package.! The amiibo is great but my box didn't come perfect, shipping didn't come so great I would of used it to just to display in the box. Beautifully detailed Amiibo! Probably my favorite so far! It is a amiibo I'd go on and say that I am enjoying my amiibo figures and Palutena's no exception...well, if you'll except the fact that she has all Custom Specials available to her from the get-go.  Nintendo's manufacturer managed to get her right in terms of design and figure.  Even her shield reflects like a mirror (I kind of used it to look at my teeth).The one thing I am not fond of is her face as I feel it could've been a lot better, but then again, this is amiibo.  So... vvvery goodvery good A+ Very detailed. Great figure to have in the collection. With so much details put into this amiibo it has become my favorite. Unlike other amiibo where there is not much detail put into them the Palutena amiibo has to be my best looking amiibo. She is simply magnificent. You guys did not place it correctly in the box and lost its value to me , disappointed  , all you had to do was turn the item around so it wouldn't get ruined in the box Arrived undamaged Great Retailer exclusivity is a crime against customers, but Palutena is an awesome figure.  Trainer tip: Heavenly Light is a bad move. Beautiful design, great care in delivery. Very Happy Love this Beautiful love it fast delivery A must have for the collection, solely for the collection. One of the most detailed amiibo I own. She is really nice. As with all mass made toys it's hard to get one without to many flaws. . But she was painted beautifully. Thank you Don't treat your employees like s***! Awesome amiibo! Very detailed and works as it should! Great! Better than that marth amiibo. Her left arm is a little  flappie and she has a derpy smile but be sides that, she probably one of the best looking amiibo yet. Good condition Good This is a nicely detailed Amiibo.  It was also much easier to get then many of the other exclusive Amiibo so far. The amiibo box was delivered damaged. Great figure though. Very detailed! It came in perfect condition. There is nothing for me to complain about Perfect One of my favorite Amiibo's. Great item. Nice Job Amazon and great packaging!!! awesome and beautiful Good This amiibo has completely changed my life. If you have ever considered buying an amiibo you should because it may hopefully change your's as well. When i first bought this i was skeptic that i may have to go and train it a lot and spend to much time on it but little did i know the full potential of the amiibo. When i woke up one morning i hear sounds of someone playing smash bros which i thought was weird until i realized that nobody was playing but yet my amiibo was fighting another cpu. Now i had not done this and neither had anyone else the amiibo had done this itself. Now i know what you must be thinking but its true the amiibo had turned on my WiiU at night and was training itself until morning so that it would be able to prove itself to me. After i played against it and sadly lost i knew that this amiibo was worthy. After beating my other amiibos i would normally set them on fire but not this one this was the chosen one. Ever since i woke up that morning my life has been different and i have kept my amiibo by my side. Once when i was walking down the street i was being mugged but luckily my amiibo came to my rescue and 1v1'd the scrub and may have even saved my life. Believe me if you have ever considered buying an amiibo you should because yours may one day save your life. AWESOME! She is adorable product came to my house damaged Another amiibo to add to the collection Bend corner and dented box Box came damaged and opened. Perfect! Excellent condition upon arrival. Great product! Great purchase She came in great condition, very happy with my amiibo =D. ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! Amazon had enough for more than what I expected. THANK YOU Product was in good condition. One of my best Amiibo collecting achievements. Came within 2 days of ordering without prime, and great quality! The left arm with the shield seems to wobble unwillingly when lightly touch and I'm afraid it's a default with everyone else who seems to have one. Next Time you put it in stock, make sure her left arm is fixed. Shipped fast, no damage, would order again 100% happy with this item. Everything I hoped it'd be! The palutena amiibo was amazing the item came undamaged which is good since I'm trying to collect all the amiibos overall I enjoyed the service Arrived on time and the fact that I could track it made me be there upon arrival of the package. Very satisfied, love Palutena Great product. Item arrived in great condition and functions flawlessly. I'm waiting on Nintendo to actually do something useful with it though as I'm not a collector of these. I loved this product!! Came on time and in great condition! No scratches. No dents. Perfection. Such a wonderful and priceless amiibo. Nintendo has put a lot of heart into making these action figures! 5 STARS Very satisfied with my order, the package was undamaged and the Palutena was in VERY high quality. Way better that i was told It got here really fast and I love it. One thing I didn't like was her staff was curved hardcore. After opening her had to make the staff straight. Other then that it's super awesome. Arrived in perfect conditions. Very good quality highly recommend. Beautiful amiibo, tnaks Amazon!! Great amiibo. Fast Shipping. overall, she's a fantastic amiibo. She's well designed and has very good detail. The one thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is her left arm, it's extremely flimsy and it's kinda nerve wracking to think of the possibility of her arm falling off, otherwise it's a great figure. Nice condition perfectly wrapped for safekeeping in my collection Is rly good It arrived perfectly well and on time. Amazing While I was very happy to get one, the arm of the figure was out of the socket and the design on her head was bent. Awesome This amiibo is by far the best looking one so far. If you are able to order one don't hesitate you won't be disappointed. Probably the most detailed of all the amiibos, with every wave there seems to be more quality put into the accuracy of the figures.  This figure is really detailed and shows they put effort into this one Fast, item perfect For trying to capture the beauty and radiant elegance of a goddess in the form of a small, plastic figurine, it falls short. However, this is one of the most detailed figures to date and it looks absolutely great. The fingers and face are not as cleanly cut as the rest, but that can be expected for places with such small details. The end of her staff is also rather bendable and weak, so I'd make sure to straighten it out right away to form it correctly. Great! It was great Love how they handled this.  Hopefully next releases are treated the same the figure is high quality, and the amiibo works perfectly. can't ask for much more than that. Exactly what I wanted Managed to snag one before scalpers became active. Great delivery, great price, great service. Amiibo arrived with extra packaging. No damage. Works great Excellent Most detailed and beautiful Amiibo yet. Amazon handled the release very well and she arrived in perfect condition. Thanks for offering this rare exclusive. Hope there will be more in the future. One of the few Amiibos I cared about.  BRAVO Amazon for making it easy to obtain her. Great detail Love it. It's too pretty to take out of the box. Excelent product and service Good product, very well packed.. The easiest pre order on a website for amiibos I've seen in a long time.  *cheers* Perfect! Love it! Hard to come by due to stock but wonderful looking figure. Very happy with how this amiibo release was handled and the product in general. Item was in bad shape and I can't get it replaced because you know... amiibo. GOT ONE! A really good looking amiibo! It came a little bit damaged due to handling and shipping but besides that, she is perfect. Really cool, great detail Damage Box Beautiful design Excellent thanks Awesome Wasn't damaged during shipping :D I LOVE IT! Everything good but potato face tho She's beautiful! The quality in most amiibo is mediocre but she by far surpassed my expectations. just what he wanted Perfect condition The amiibo works like any other amiibo and it is awesome to have it in my collection. Beautiful figure, there are some details like the face which I didn't like and part of her &#34;belt&#34; which looks like it was literally painted but overall I love it. I was afraid the package would suffer since it was shipped from the US and later came to Mexico but it looks like there weren't any problems since the package arrived in perfect condition. Good The detail is amazing. Probably one of my favorite amiibos so far. Everything good... pure beauty! It came fine and dandy little ware. Awesome! Was what I expected! In perfect shape !

It does amiibo things well but it's not a great lightsaber Came in perfect condition! No damage to the Amiibo or its packaging One of the most beautiful amiibos yet! She's nice and meaty. Solid amiibo, and was delivered fast. Awesome No damage when it came! Great detail figure amino! Most detailed amiibo yet. I'm glad I got a Marth Amiibo.

Especially with my pit and dark pit amiibos A great figure with alot of great detail. Good quality item This is the right way to sell em..1 per customers It's an amiibo. It came in a box. It was not damaged.Pit is a little jealous right now though. Awesome amiibo. Her right arm (with shield) seems flimsy though. A great addition to my collection! Looks good. Great I could but this on release date :) \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb This amiibo is gorgeous! One of the most lovely and detailed amiibo to come out, definitely.And the parcel it came in was perfect for it's size and it didn't come with any imperfections. No dents or bends. Fantastic! Glad to see more of these are becoming easily available and the scalpers are taking a hike, so those of us who are actual collectors can get our hands on them. Amazing product!! Exclusive yet easy to get The Palutena amiibo was perfect and arrived on time. Couldn't be happier. I have to say that this is one of the best amiibo's out there.  Very detailed. solid figure glad they were able to fullfill supply demands Well worth the stress of refresh refresh refresh...!!! Everything was awesome Arrived safe and in good condition. No ones fault but Nintendo, but they gave her man hands. Perfect It was everything I hoped and more...... long live Palutena!!!  Viva La Palutena!!!!!!!!! Best looking Amiibo I have in my collection! Good Box was ripped and bad condition. Bad idea buying this This item is great.  But not because of the figure is why I gave it 5 stars. The real reason was that I was able to get this item with no hassle and there was still a lot in stock once I bought mine. Good yes... and well packateged Came in great condition and is a beautiful figure. Arrived fast and with no damage!! Great timing, wonderful The Palutena amiibo came in very bad condition. Bent and nearly open from the terrible condition it came in. Great figurine, you should get a restock of it! It arrived in a timely manner. I enjoy having it displayed with my other amiibo. It was handled properly..no bent corners, no scratches. I'm glad I managed to snag this Amazon Exclusive amiibo. Love it! Amazing Looks great.Thanks Came quickly and without flaws! Came in good condition. She's the best amiibo packaging arrived undamaged. Very Happy! A lot better in person Awesome product, exeeded my expectations I was able to ask the mine and was delighted with it Perfect, as shown and quick shipping...great transaction The release for Palutena has to be the smoothest for an exclusive besides Gamestop's retro 3 pack! I wish they were all this easy! Great job Amazon! Very good deal, the amiibo arrived in excellent conditions. Im so happy Good condition Great quality. Good shipment timeGreat conditionExcellent Amiibo gameplay So far I have 5 Amiibos (yes, amiibos with an &#34;s&#34;, I don't care if the plural is amiibo), Palutena, Pit (J), Dark Pit (J), Yoshi and Link.Palutena is my favorite by far, she's heavy so it give the impresion of being sturdy and the details in her ornaments and clothes are amazing.My only complaing is that her eyes are the wrong color, blue and were suppose to be green, which is weird considering how detailed everything else is, but I'm not to take away a star for something so small.Totally worth the $13 I paid. I'm glad Amazon and Nintendo have decided to finally play nice together. Amazon's amazing handling of such a hot product was wonderful and very appreciated. My only complaint is that I'd still prefer to buy my miib's in store so I can pick the highest quality one. Awesome amiibo figure! No damage to the package and no defects. Good purchase! Some of the detailed painted are ok, but compared to the quality of other US sold amiibos, (like Shulk for example) this amiibo could've had more work done. Her left leg is really out of proportion. (It's super thick when seen on the side.) came in pristine condition Great Great and fast Great exclusive amiibo! It arrived on timed Amazing best experience I had smooth and quick Great quality Amiibo Both came in perfect condtion Exactly as advertised. Love my palutena It was a good buy I loved it. Fast and easy! Nice product Came in good shape The item came in almost perfect condition and I was super happy with the figure itself! Just Beautiful  And fun to look at Excellent condition! The packaging was a little damaged but other then that can't complain. Thank You Great product. Looks amazing, very detailed. One problem many people had was with the way her face looks, but I personally loved it. 10/1 would buy again XD Packaging wasn't perfect, item arrived with a couple of dents in the plastic. Nice item Palutena arrived 5 days after purchasing her, again earlier than expected as before with Fox and Captain Falcon, no complaints at all with the condition her box arrived in nor the figure itself. 10/10 would buy more Amiibo. Very pleased with the actual product, and it even showed up early! Fantastic! Best Amiibo transaction yet It worked!! Loved it! All perfect! Thanks! It came damaged :( Love this amiibo and got it really fast. Came perfect in perfect condition!! Came as expected. Flawless Figure is amazing and box came without a dent. So pretty and got to me really fast after I bought it Haven't used it. Keeping her as a collectors item.", "This game is awesome. Such a great adventure story. And buying the legendary edition with the add-ons was totally worth the extra quests and amount of gameplay. Recommend it highly. The ultimate RPG game.  If you are looking for a prewinter buy...this is it. Great Skyrim is beautiful and harsh, it is ambitious and buggy, but that is why it is the best RPG to date and one of the best video games to date. Bethesda is no newbie to the RPG world and Skyrim is the fifth installment of an already very well developed video game franchise and virtual world. Tamriel is a huge land full of rich history, lore, legends and adventures and Skyrim further developes Tamriel even more than it already is. Skyrim is easy to play, easy to learn and really tailors well to individual styles of play. Skyrim is a true Open World game and one of my favorites in the genre (only surpassed by Fallout: New Vegas because the amount of control you have over the events and outcomes of that game is astounding). Skyrim has a wonderful and rich storyline and gameplay. It can easily entertain for 200+ hours on just the base game. That being said it is worth the extra money to buy the legendary edition - you won't regret it. The legendary edition adds hundreds more hours of game play not to mention a separate land (Solstheim) and 2 separate worlds (Soul Cairn and the Forgotten Vale)  and the ability to build your own house (within limits). I own Skyrim on 2 platforms the base game on the Xbox 360 and the Legendary edition on the PC. I would strongly advise that you buy Skyrim for the PC. If PC has the ability to play Skyrim than mods can really rejuvenate and enhance a 4 year old game and make it feel new again not to mention add hundreds of hours to game play, improve game play, fix bugs, and allows you even more customization than you already had to begin with. So if you ever need a new game to play Skyrim is the way to go. Always.", "Good price great one i like it This goes for all Xbox One controllers:They work great and there is no strain to the hand. The reason for 3 stars is the physical charging capabilities on the controllers. The cable and the port are very sensitive that just putting a small amount of strain on the cable while it's charging can ruin it to its entirety. If you feel like this won't be an issue then go for it. You can save a lot of money on batteries due to everything that's put into the controller. If this happens to you, you can go to Xbox and ask for a replacement depending on if it's still under warranty. I got this May 15th and was still under warranty for replacement as of August 30th. Best price anywhere! Fast shipment works awsome battery life was bad Boyfriend loves it Worked fine, rattled with every vibration though Exactly what I needed. Was trying to hold off on buying a second controller because of the cost but eventually gave in so I could play Zombies with my BF. I would only ever buy Xbox brand controllers.", "great 3 months out of warranty aaaaand it crashed! Over $100 to fix", "This thing did NOT work. It's actually two pieces which - I assume - are supposed to fit together and then fit into your controller with the batteries inside. We got the pieces together, yay. Stuck them in the controller, woot. But the thing was loose and almost fell out of the controller no matter how many of us tried (hopefully ruling out user error). With this useless cover wiggling around in there, the batteries don't make a connection, making the cover totally useless. Don't make our mistake and waste money by being cheap :p  I'm on here now shopping for a different one.... Works fantastic! The controller was still dead. Worked for about five seconds and then never worked again. Great price, and had no issues with the item! Works just like any other", "must buy a monthly subscription to play this game. COMPLETE SCAM. Best game ever! It is so fun to play, and I love the Dr. Suess-like cartoony graphics. Basically kid friendly Call of Duty. NOTE: You need Xbox live and Origin account. It's very nice.", "If you have a PS4 you know that black box gets pretty hot during long gaming sessions. This stand with switchable dual fans helps keep your PS4 at optimal performance temps. Plus it adds dual charging stations for controllers and adds two extra USB ports. While this item comes with no instructions on setup it's still very easy to connect. Just know that this stand doesn't &#34;Lock In&#34; your PS4 and while it firmly supports it vertically it will not prevent an accidental overturn if you do not have it on a firm shelf.The dual fans make some noise but not enough to distract you over background noises. As for the USB ports, you connect a USB lead from the stand to one of the open ports on your PS4, this gives you one open port on the PS4 and 3 USB ports on the stand itself. Also if you have the PS4 settings in Rest Mode it will automatically shut down the fans when it turns off power to the USB ports. I found this stand to everything advertised and a well made 3rd party accessory for your PS4 for the price. Excellent product. 100% satisfied. I can't speak for how well the fan works, to be honest it's not really the reason I bought this. But as far as saving space goes this thing is great. The system doesn't really lock into place, but so long as you don't fall into your tv stand (or wherever you keep your PS4) you should be okay. The fan is a little bit noisy if you're sitting in a quiet room, but if you're mid game or watching something on your Playstation it's not really that noticeable. However, they kindly help you with any issues you might have with that by adding a stop button that basically toggles the fans on and off. For the price, as just a stand and charger it's a no-brainer, while the fans seem to be just wishful thinking, it's something I'll let myself believe really works for everything else I am getting in this stand. Very weak fan. System feels hotter than before just running netflix. Only use aside from a stand is to charge two controllers and the extra hubs. If you want that I recommend one that isn't a vertical stand and doesn't restrict airflow in to the system.*UPDATEOk, so I decided to use it for about 3 months...It was fine, a little noisy at first but tolerable. I would say after a month and 3/4 in the noise got louder, which scared me because I thought it was the system. The sound when I disconnected it was golden silence, that's how annoying it was. I use Netflix a lot and believe me when I say it was annoying hearing a mini vacuum while watching Netflix or just on standby/rest mode. After that I only used it while gaming, hoping it would go back to the way it used to sound when I first got it. It didn't workout as planned.So now its laying on top of my flat system being used as a charging/hub station. I recommend that.....yeah just that....unless you like the sound of hand held vaccuums and restricting outwards airflow while keeping the fan off. -gasp for air- Awesome space saving device What a complete knock-off.  The box has the S in PS4 backwards (lolz).  But it does the job, the fans don't do much as the intake is pretty obscured, but otherwise works as designed. Just as shown and keeps unit cool Came in in perfect condition and works great Great stand", "excellent Very good console, I like it so much, The big cons is that the machines thoesn't came with his charger If you have the old versions you'll appreciate this system so much. It's so much faster than the previous model. Graphics are great. 3D is great when I use it. C stick is pretty great for games like Smash Bros or Monster Hunter.Only con is the game cartridge spot is kind of in an odd spot. My fingers rest there when I hold the device so I get a little worried I'll pop the game out by mistake. They have just what they say they have. Thanks a million. My son loves it One of the best purchases I've made. Great product, but shipping with I-Parcel was a nightmare. It's a cool gaming device!", "I love it! terrific sale, fast delivery Its in amazing condition :) but I was hoping for the American version but its ok I didn't read the info of the amiibo good", "Yesterday i received my package, however, the disc is bent, i took some pictures before opening the disc, please indicate you are responsible for changing the disc? The game is so good and it follows the story closely and there are so many new features. its definitely better than pirates warriors 2 Big one piece  fan love the dynasty  warriors  play style Great game but I didn't get the dlc which is why I preordered it otherwise I'd give it 5 stars Like that game! I and my husband have a lot of fun! Great hack and slash with nice and polished graphics.It's cool being able to take that trip down memory lane and remembering how One Piece started and now how much it's evolved. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for some simple and fun gameplay on the ps4. Greetings,Reference to the pre order of &#34;One Piece Pirate Warriors 3&#34; on PlayStation 4 which comes with 2 promotional codes.I only received one code for the digital manga copy. However, I did not receive the second code of &#34;4 exclusive DLCs including 2 missions and 2 costumes consisting of Luffy as a Giant Fish and Sabo dressed as Lucy&#34;.Waiting your kind reply regarding this issue.Regards, Preordered game. Got only the manga code but no dlc code for the costumes or the extra missions. Game plays awesomely, though. Please respond about the dlc codes. As awesome as it can be! Dynasty Warriors fighting style + Unique One Piece characters' abilities and skills! This game is just amazing!Story's not given really detailed as it is in manga/anime. Better look through all the original manga/anime if you want to feel the real awesomeness of One Piece. Other than that, everything is excellent. everything good except my case was broken when i received and no dlc code Everything is good but there is no doc code included. I preorder this game for these codes so please reply and solve it. Perfect for a dedicated One Piece fan. Might be some spoilers if you're not 150+ (even more actually. There are some deep spoilers right off the bat. Even with some of the trailers. So tread LIGHTLY if you are a new comer to the series.) episodes in, if you look in the terms glossary and character gallery. Some later information is revealed right off the bat. So proceed with caution.  If you're not a fan of One Piece though, this wouldn't be the way to catch up in the series. Yes it covers most of the main Arks, but there are handfuls of memorable scenes that are just written over. Like they didn't even introduce Axe Morgan's Son. The Sub isn't hard to read, the map is very well detailed. You can also change the map.  You can get used to what the &#34;Something is getting attacked!&#34; or &#34;You gotta go there!&#34; alerts that go on.   The online system is great. It's easy to find a match, haven't had a lot of lag issues. Only once. Probably on my end.  The online system feels rewarding. It keeps up to progress with your story mode just like free-mode progress does.   It'd be best to catch up on the show, then play the game for fun.", "Awesome! I would enjoy this game a lot more if they didn't force me to watch every single LONG a** cut-scene.", "It was not gold! great", "Goodd.... excelent productos Great product!  No more sore thumbs from regular controllers! After using the Kai for a number of months i would have to say it has proved itself a powerful tool for the fighting game player looking to get in on the next gen train.The stock stick feels great and with the lower distance it takes to activate a direction makes executing moves feel even faster. The stock kuro buttons on the other hand felt a bit weird but I replaced them with Sanwa part's no problem.The stock art looks good, but for those who want to customize a little bit, Arts Hobbies does offer a template and replacement plexi glass for people who want a bit of personal flair. Product is amazing! Not too heavy and not too light. The buttons aren't sticky as some people have said and the joystick feels like it could last a life time. I package came 3 days early as well! Over all 5 star product and would recommend to anyone on the fence of what fight stick to buy. Overall a great stick. The lack of a palm rest is not the best compared to other manufacturers sticks. Buttons feel a little unrefined but does not impact operation and works very well. Sensitive stick and buttons. The space between the bottom 4 buttons and where your wrist would rest is practically non existent. I normally am all about choosing the cheaper option but after seeing my friends TE2, the extra 50 dollars is incredibly worth it.The stock hori buttons and the hayabusa stick are pretty meh in my opinion. The buttons are too shallow and the hayabusa doesnt even allow for you to change the gate.", "My son loved it! Awesome stuff glad to add it to the collection. Great! I love it!!! Awesome Great Great amiibo to have. Super happy about this. This Japanese one work perfectly on my U.S. region system. Came with 2-day shipping even though I bought it from a seller in Japan, and it hasn't even come out yet in the U.S.", "Such an amazing game..... The game is awesome! Graphics are excellent. Huge improvement from the ps3 version and love the extra content; it saved me some money. Game of the year......hands down Ive been a Nintendo fan forever until Wii u .... Switched to PS4 and the last of us remastered was my first experience .... Was like being Married for 20 years with a fat so ....and then after the switch going to bed with jennifer lawrence..... Great game play, very engaging. Story was well thought out, the ending was good as well.My favorite game ever was the Tomb Raider series (PS1) and after playing Tomb Raider Definitive edition, The Last of Us blew it away.The graphics are insanely real. Great product, Thanks. it been almost a year since last time I play it, still can find a replacement", "This game is so amazing. The remastered cut scenes and engine are terrific and the nostalgia that I feel is too much for words. Get this game NOW or you'll lose your availability to play the other three games via BC FOR FREE!!! Great great game. Makes me remember the good ol' days playing this for the 360!! Mastered and perfected. Graphics are amazing and crisp. Bloody and loud. Loved it. Brother and I beat it in 2 days!! This game is great fun!  So far my favorite Xbox One game.  Great long single player campaign and fun multiplayer.  If you consider yourself a Gears fan, you don't want to miss this! A++++ Been playing Gears since day one and the did a great job with the remaster Dear Coalition, where is the best part about this game? The private multiplayer mode with bots.I am disappointed. I am hopeful you will bring it back in Gears 4. An amazing remake of the original game which is a blast. Graphics are crisp and upgraded using the Unreal 3 engine, this is an amazing competitive 3rd person shooter that I highly recommend. This is a very nice remastered version of GoW. No crab walking online, no more getting stuck on the wall. Team Death Match added as well, and for only 40 bucks! Online I haven't lagged at all yet and I'm impressed so far... If your a veteran Gear player I suggest you get this ASAP, finding matches very quickly no matter what hour of the day  ***UPDATE 1/2/16***  I was able to download Gears 1-3 and Gears Judgement which was nice (if you got the chance to play this any day in 2015, you'll be able to download all for free, Xbox will send you the codes) The nice part is that all the maps are for free (DO MOT BUY THEM WHEN SAYS NEEDS TO BE DOWNLOADED TO PLAY RANKED OR UNRANKED) Go to manage game on each one, and it'll show the maps that are ready to install and for free! =)  Even if you wasn't able to play in 2015, it's still a good deal to play GoW 1 remastered, GameStop brand new 40 dollars, but right now Amazon has new copies for 25 bucks wich is an amazing deal! It's GoW finally on Xbox One, so I couldn't be any happier, so much fun. I've noticed a few glitches, but it really doesn't bother me that much, although I know there's a bunch of other gamers out there that get annoyed by the smallest things. The only thing I will say is the graphics aren't what I expected! In my honest opinion, I think Gears of War 3 looked better. Other than that, I'm so stoked to be playing this again! One of my favorites. Memories came back with this game !!! Just hoping Marcus comes back in Gears 4 This game is a remake, meaning the defining characteristic of Gears of war 1 had to show and stick around; literally Fps , clunky, and simply slow in comparison to Gears 2/3. This was due to time restrain and the port simply not working as well to Xbox one but the way I see it it was not only an opportunity for Black tusk to experiment as well as measure sales but it simply gave them the opportunity to get used to the essence of what makes a Gears game a Gears game; this is where it all started after all.  The graphics and story are revamped give both newcomers a beautiful first time experience and the veterans, like me, the nostalgia we hoped for. The game is absolutely amazing in comparison and for those who don't agree.... They've gotta be blind or relying on memory (try gears 1 for Xbox 360 its like $5) I cant make it past the 1st chapter even if you paid me. I simply don't have enough patience for the outdated mechanics. However I found myself walking though gears UE analyzing the graphics in ever chapter, amazed instead of running through and even attempting to wallbouce since the speed was now fast enough to consider it.  Inn every chapter I noticed the scene was always kept true to gow1 but updated to have more of an effect in rage of emotions due to a now noticeable blood shed, light coming in on a garden, or the characters reacting to someone's death who was before disregarded and unimportant and It hurts ... Haha however the big con I noticed was the AI...they're broken and seem to have been doing drugs since they run into walls, take cover on the wrong walls keeping themselves exposed, and occasionally having a dance off which could cause single players a major issue and I find it unforgivable to have such a massive issue left un-addressed.  Multiplayer wise.... It's a brutal as it's ever been and not for everyone. You won't be able to pick it up as easily as a call out duty game or halo. People playing this game are unforgiving and its best to play alongside someone else or a team if youre new lol.  People will constantly complain about the gnasher accuracy (as always) , speed, and power weapon rages and I doubt this will ever change but I have to say this is an enjoyable multiplayer in comparison to GOWJ and I would regard it almost as highly as GOW3. There are kinks that need to be worked out but nothing I noticed that couldn't be patched in later and it shouldn't take 1000 patched like with destiny or the, still broken halo mcc; this works. Lol my personal issue with the game is not having surround sound but, correct me if I'm wrong, this seems to be a feature mostly unsupported by Xbox one and not just the game in general.   If you buy this and you're new, please, please, please, play the campaign first and get used to the mechanics since multiplayer may turn you off from the game. It's a shark tank but it's the rush you get once you've gotten used to it that will keep some of us up until 7am playing -it may  take some brutal beatings before you begin to enjoy it. XD Bought this as a pre order, got here the day it released. Nice game, brings me back to the good ol' days of Gears! As a fan of the Gears series I was not dissapointed by remastered efforts here. The game play is the same with a little bit of touch up using the Xbox One controller. The cutscenes have all been redone and are fantastic. A must play for any Gears fan. One of the best remasters, nuff said I remember buying an xbox 360 and gears of war almost a decade ago. I remember it being the reason sony lost the console war. Gears of war trashed resistance fall of man. Back then, the graphics, gameplay, physics, and even the AI, story, and characters, were all strikingly new and fresh. Of course, you can't praise gears' story and characters without getting mocked, but I remember being interested in the main character, imprisoned for desertion/treason by the coalition of organized governments, who is then freed out of desperation as humanity runs out of soldiers.The city you explore is one that fell during Marcus' incarceration.  The court that convicted him has been abandoned to the locust, and the people who convicted him are either dead or evacuated.  Awesome.What's special about it, is that he never turns his back on humanity. &#34;i'm not doing this for you&#34;.I still love hearing Marcus Fenix voice.  It's got that movie magic to it, and it's an strong now as it was then.  The haunting song &#34;14 years after E day&#34; still perfectly helps set the dark tone of the game.  The sound design is still king.Everything about it felt next gen, aside from the laggy, host advantage peer to peer online gameplay. One shotgun roller was in a class of his own, and you just had to hope it was you, or at least that he was on your team.Much of it has aged.  Most of it poorly.  You basically move from cover to cover, shooting enemies, for hours on end with very little else happening to break up the monotony.The time and effort they put into reskinning this game could have been invested in a brand new game entirely, a new story, new characters, Hell, maybe even a brand new franchise.It feels like the only reason this game exists is to make money. Fans of the franchise, like me, already played gears of war multiple times back when it was new.I just fail to grasp the concept here. What were they thinking?It's ironic because the problems with gears of war were obviously never it's graphics. So they tried to fix the graphics. wtf?Why remake a decade old game without changing anything but the graphics? Who was like 'gears of war will sell copies once we fix the graphics'  lol...  who greenlit this project?It's painful how repetitive the game feels today. The whole production feels small now. It lacks the spectacle and scope of gears 2, the jaw dropping set pieces... I remember how satisfied I was to roll, roadie run, slide into and mantle over cover, stop and pop, back when I'd never done it before. But now we've all been doing this for 4 games. 4 Gears of War games, and now they try to get people to pay 40$ to replay the original? How many cover shooters have we played since then? Over and over and over and over, and now go back to the very first that got it right. And they want 40 dollars to do that?  And Microsoft wonders why they're losing this generation.  The asking price is an insult to fans of the franchise.  Gears 3 cost less at launch.Videogames, and even the gears of war franchise, have come a long way in the last 10 years. This remake hasn't.Gears, Grand Theft Auto, and  Uncharted, three of the highest reviewed franchises in existence, have been cranking out cover shooters for 9 years, and things have changed.Is Microsoft even going to try to beat Sony?  This isn't the way.  I also fail to see how this fits into Microsoft's arsenal of exclusive games.  What PS4 owner is going to say to themselves &#34;Gears of War one for 40 bucks?  I'm buying and Xbox One!&#34;  Nobody is going to say that.  When you look back at the megahits that shaped the Xbox brand, they were halo, Halo 2, and Gears of War.  Where does Gears of War Ultimate at this price point fit into the picture.  No where.  It's a huge misstep that fans of the franchise are never going to forget, and PS4gamers aren't going to care about.  You're either being insulted, or you just don't care.What we should have gotten, was a compilation of gears 1, 2, and 3 in 1080p and 60fps for 10$ or so.Also, the reskin doesn't look that much different than the original. If your'e going to reskin an entire game, shouldn't you be aiming for a completely different look? I mean, if you're trying to maintain the look, feel, and tone of the original, why the hell reskin it? Gears Ultimate wouldn't even look like the original if I had my way. You wouldn't even be able to recognize it. But not so, you always know exactly where you are, because you can always recognize the geometry and the colors and textures that look very similar. I never ever felt lost in a new game world. It's a testament to how iconic the original is/was, and yet another reason this game should never have been made.I'm not even sure if the remaster looks better than the original.  I know it doesn't look as good as Gears 4.Everytime I play Gears Ultimate, I wish I was playing Gears 4 instead.I should be able to easily see the graphical improvements given it's on a next gen console, but the only thing I'm sure of is that it's running at a higher resolution.  Big deal.  Higher res graphics do not always translate into better graphics.Gears of War's graphics were a masterpiece then, and in my eyes they still are.  It's a classic.  No need for a reskin.  It's the rest of the game that's the problem.Ultimate's graphics style is like  &#34;imagine if we made gears of war look more like every other game on the market&#34;.  It just feels bland and uninspired, like no one had a clear vision of what the game should be, and that's something gears of war never lacked, vision.  I think that's why this remake is such a failure.  It lacks the vision and sense of purpose of the original.I do not personally feel that the new textures look better all the time.  They usually have higher resolution, yes, but there are many times when I wonder if the original's graphics are superior.It does not look worse than the original, but I feel that most times it just looks a little different.  The plastic sheen on characters faces is lessened, and I agree that this might be somewhat of an improvement. I honestly feel like there should be no contest between this next gen remake and the original.  Gears Ultimate should be flat out wasting Gears one, and it doesn't.  It should be blatantly obvious which game looks better.  I don't really blame the artists for this.  There wasn't much room for improvement to begin with.Another irony. Microsoft needed gears of war last generation, needed a way to beat Sony. Yet again, Microsoft needs another gears of war, another way to beat sony. And here it is. haha. It's just like microsoft to crank out a game like this, especially for this price.They've finally stopped reselling us windows over and over, and started reselling us gears.What if instead of making this, they had made a prequel to Gears of War, where you start as Fenix fighting in the pendulum wars, then Emergence Day happens, and you attempt to repel the locust invasion.  Fight at asypho fields and see what happened there.  That would have been awesome.Or what if they retold Gears of War one in an alternate reality?  What if they decided to break Fenix out of prison against the cog's wishes?  What if you fought through the city as it was falling, rather than after it had fallen?Or what if everything had been redesigned, so it's the same exact story, but the shape and look of everything is different.  The prison and everthing else is designed differently, and all the boss fights redone with a different strategy to beat each?  So the plot is exactly the same but everything else is new?So many possibilities.  So many wasted opportunities.Gears of War 1 is simply a poor candidate for this kind of remaster. It was more about doing things 'new' than doing things well. More about revolution than evolution. It's a game that demanded sequels, demanded a franchise, demanded the creation of a new genre, and that genre has been in constant flux, constant evolution since then. Virtually almost everything about the original no longer holds up,  and now visually, it looks more like every other videogame than gears of war.  I shake my head at all this. Have the games graphics aged? Yes, a bit, and it's noticeable, but as I said before, so has everything else in the game, and they didn't see the need to fix any of that.Gears of war wasn't just a next gen game. it was a next gen franchise. An IP born at the start of the next generation. It took advantage of all the capabilities of the xbox 360. The entire game streamed right off the disc. There were no loading times unless you died. Each soldier in your squad had their own uniquely designed and textured in high definition armor. Weapons like the sub machine gun assault rifle chainsaw combo lancer, the hammer of dawn firing burning lasers from the sky, all the different locust enemies you'd never seen before, the 'destroyed beauty' art style. Getting downed from taking damage and hoping a teamate would revive you before you got curb stomped. It was a rush of new, burning passion. And that deserves another new game, with the same drive to take us new places and show us new things. Not a reskin.I am glad that they have finally fixed the multiplayer with dedicated servers, but its 10 years too late.  I remember how disappointed I was trying to play the original online.  Emptying entire clips into enemies and not killing them, instantly dying from a shotgun running host.  It was miserable.  The online was really the only thing about the game that didn't work.  I remember how stoked I was to get into multplayer, and damn, was it a massive let down.  Gear one was basically unplayable.You know, thinking back to Gears one reminds me of the achievement &#34;always remember your first&#34; that you earn after your first chainsaw kill. &#34;always remember your first&#34;.... can any gamer forget the first time they played gears of war? What a rush. What I want, is the next gears of war. The next shocking new experience that I'll never forget.*update -  I've now completely finished the campaign, and I have very little to add except that I was exhausted and grateful when the train ride was over.  Memorable moments like blowing up chaps gas station are ruined by some of the fakest looking explosions I have ever seen.  I also noticed that many character models look worse than they did in the original.  I played most of the game coop as the host, and it was, at least on my end, a lag free experience.  AI Dom kept getting cornered and killed by the bezerker over and over again.I still feel that the game makes a mistake by not letting you rescue civilians.  there's a sense that there's nothing left to fight for or protect because the game is lacking in interesting and likeable characters aside from dom and the main protagonist, but it's realistic that there's nobody left to defend in a city that fell to the locust long ago.The added brumak fight is anticlimactic and boring, just like I remember it from the pc version.  The brumak is supposed to be scary, but the dialogue and actions of your squad diminish that fear completely.On the multiplayer side of things, the lack of lag online has made super weapons incredibly dangerous, and all of them are easy to use.  I don't like weilding them.  It feels like cheating.  Epic should have rebalanced these weapons but they didn't.

Epic :  I am not going to tape crosshairs to my TV.  Fix your game. Great game for the time but an oldie and IMO its getting to be played out. If you're looking for split screen its a good choice but don't expect a huge difference from the original Gears of War - at the end of the day it's a standard remaster which means you get some bonus content and improved graphics. If you have the PC version there's no reason to play this one except split screen.  Not a system seller but its a decent game until we can enjoy Fallout 4 this fall I suppose! Worth it I am actually a pretty hardcore Gears of War fan. I have them all. At first I was not sure I was going to get this, since I have already played the game on Xbox 360 in 2007. If you are wondering if enough is different to justify the purchase, well yes there is. The game still has that gritty dark look that so many people liked about the series. I know a lot of the early videos made the game look a lot brighter than the original. This actually is not how GOW Ultimate is. I repeat it is very dark and gritty.One thing I do not like is the computer intelligence of your comrades is just as stupid if not more stupid then the original game. You basically just play the game by yourself. The computer controlled partners will run right out and get shot and are useless. Also I really would have liked if they would have thrown in a version of Horde in the game. I know Horde did not debut until the second game, but it has a huge following. I cannot wait until GOW 4. Beautiful graphics! Kinda bummed no horde but I can wait a little longer. Theron code was emailed after delivered just as Amazon said- Email subject is :Your Amazon.com Promotional Code. Masterpiece. The Coalition did an exceptional job, Gears looks better than ever and serves as a reminder of what a seminal piece of gaming history looks like. The re-mastered levels look incredible, absolutely incredible!!! This is Gears of War the Way I the way I thought I remembered it! I played the original first one recently and bou has it aged but this remaster is damn near perfect. The graphics are obviously uped and the frame rate is up there so it feels next gen. This is definitely the definitive multiplayer of Gears at its Best. They kept the balanced fair aspects and threw out the unecessary. Definitely get it if you are a competitive player and if your casual at least they have a good campaign plus the other games come free if you get it before December 31st. If you're bad prepared to face one of the most competitive and least forgiving communities in Gears. Seriously these few can rival those MOBA enthusiats. This game was awesome 10 years ago, but now after playing more refined versions (Gears 2 and 3) you realize how bad this one was.  Total waste of money.  Multiplayer destroyed my will to even playthrough campaign. Haven't played the campaign yet, so I'll update this later once I do. However I have played much of the multiplayer and can say it's definitely great. No preorder order code for the Savage Theron Guard multiplayer charater i was suppose to get with my preorder. The game itself is a 5/5 game. Loved it on the 360 back when it came out.The remaster though? Still fantastic, and they did a great job, but I have a few complaints. In some scenes in the campaign, there is a bit of stuttering, pop-in, and delayed loading for objects in the game. It hasn't happened too much to make me want to give this game a 2-3 star review, but I figured it was worth noting. Also noticed some screen-tearing in the campaign.The online holds up beautifully, running at a solid 60fps with no hiccups. I find that strange, and wonder why the single player isn't as fluid.Other than that though, a fantastic remaster. Looks great and plays well.  My only complaint is that Dom is CONSTANTLY getting killed.  I don't remember the bots being this easy to down in the original.  Still a boat load of fun though. I wish i could blame chemtrails or flouride for dulling the minds of console gamers, but that would mean that only xbox one users are breathing in or drinking the poison that is dulling their minds.  To encapsulate the history - this game is like 20 years old, originally released on the xbox.  Not xbox one, not xbox 360, but the original xbox.  So, you'd think this would be 60fps.  Well guess what?  This &#34;ultimate edition&#34; is an ultimate excrement, as you are even lucky to get 30fps in campaign.  Really?  And why people still cash up money for this just baffles me.  When you look at the ps3, it released an awesome game called &#34;the last of us.&#34;  Well, that game is much more new, and ps4 could remaster that game in 60fps no problem.  So xbox one is the michal jackson of the consoles.  That is, it's meant for kids, it's not good for them, yet they still like it.  Go figure.Ps4 is a cadillac,  Xbone is a Michal Jackson within Christopher Reeve. One of the best shooters of all time returns remastered on xbox one, it looks awesome and it also gives you all 4 original titles when backwards compatibility releases, so you are getting 5 games for 39$ it's a steal, multiplayer runs like never before it's amazing. Did not get the digital content code promised for pre-orders. Really should have been all three games, one game remaster, access to beta, and all the games when backwards combaitblity is out for 360.  Not worth $40, i think maybe 25 i would feel fine paying it but just cost to much for what you get.The remaster it self is really good, yes some of the problems that is in the original was not fix (should have been fix) but still i expected this.THE WORST THING IS ONLY MULTIPLAYER IS 60FPS single player is 30FPS if i knew this i would have waited and got it on pc so i could play at 60 fps Great game Its gears of war, it's such an awesome game. The game looks and plays amazing and the sound is really great as well. I would have paid $100 for this game. Gears of war ROCKS!!!!! it's a good game but to keep it concise--this game really should be anchoring and setting the standard for current-gen multiplayer...but it's not.leave it to microsoft to muckup one of the best games (tried & proven).the game engine seems jittery and at times, when strafing, you will get negative feedback which causes your character's movement to stutter.context sensitivity for environment interaction (i.e. doing S.W.A.T. turns--peeling off of cover) are not there when they should be.  Devs missed a lot--when they shouldn't.  trying to aim from cover often results in peeling you off the wall instead.  The blind fire itself, if you're trying to pull compound actions is pretty unpredictable.  It's really watered down the complexity of what a player can do.  For example, wanna pull off a headshot around the corner from cover and then horizontally jump away?  Good luck executing, maybe 2 of the 3 will happen, jumping--not aiming, maybe jumping and pulling of the shot in some random order.  I don't know if it's my connection but at a solid 55mb down and 5 up--I should be good.Everything multiplayer is sad.  Matchmaking is atrocious and takes terribly-long.  King of the Hill (annex) only lasts 1 round.  Expect about 5 minutes between multiplayer matches (finish-to-next-start).  Oh and if you make it to the finish screen after a match--the screen is locked.  You cannot exit until the next screen loads (maybe 45-60 seconds later).grenade physics respond as though you're shotputting a 16-lb bowling ball.  Unless you deliberately hold L-trigger to actually bolo throw the grenade--good luck getting it farther than 2-feet from you.  (use at your own peril)The gnasher seems to be its old self (finally a praise) but hip firing is very deceptive because if you use the direction of the shotgun as an indicator--you will be horribly misled and it's intensely counterintertuitive to fire at the center of the screen--ignoring the direction the muzzle is pointing.This is my favorite series of all time and I was nothing less than ecstatic to play.  I have all but sworn off video games due to the gloomy and uninspired video game culture that seems to be trending and I was hopeful for this but sorely disappointed with the rerelease.It is what it is and it's still a lot of fun to play multiplayer sans the looming flaws aforementioned.the campaign is the same as the PC version so there are extra chapteres compared to the original 360 version.graphics look great but the feel is off...especially hipfiring the gnasher.favorite series of all time and I was nothing less than ecstatic to play.

Nice game, nice speed. Gears of War UE is in my opinion a must own for Xbox One owners and a must get the console for those who don't. Not a new skinned remaster but a total rebuilding from the ground up of a modern classic. It looks brand new, it feels brand new. It is a must play for anyone who wants an adrenaline fueled action third-person shooter, with a tight cover system, amazing & powerful weapons, killer AI and the beginnings of one of the most epic stories in video game history. Missing this game for any reason would be a mistake, especially giving the added value of not one, not two, not three, but all FOUR Gears games which will be made available from Xbox 360 by backwards compatibility AND the beta to the highly anticipated latest entry in the series, Gear of War 4. Dont even read the one star reviews there all butthurt haters who probably don't even have an Xbox One. The game is amazing I play all night every night add me CarpaltonnelGears for Life! Great game, decade veteran loving the immersion of nostalgic content remastered for 60 FPS.  After receiving my pre-order bonus I was more than excited to reconsider my prior marking for reviewing this title. I love this game. It is fun to play and you have to have skills to play this. Wall bouncing on this game is awesome and the graphics are perfect. I highly recommend buying this game! I purchased this game from the store, but I'm posting this review for people that are interested in buying it. Another reason is because there's a bunch of fanboys posting false reviews. Basically, I tried campaign for a few hours and some multiplayer. Both played really smooth. The graphics are really clean, it's one of the best looking games on Xbox one. For people that like the gears series, I'd say it's well worth the 40 dollar price tag. It's basically a brand new game for 20 dollars less than the usual price of a brand new game. For new comers to the series, if you like third person shooters with intense action, check it out. It's an excellent value for the price. Plus you'll get all of the other Xbox 360 versions of gears of war once those games become available for Xbox one, but I believe you need to play at least one online game within a certain time span to unlock them. I have a ps4 as well. I just like fun games. I enjoy both consoles. Don't believe the fanboys. So far so good. I have played every gears including Judgment which most people skipped. Personally I was hoping for a Gears 3 remaster since that would have all the improvements and modes people have demanded over the years, but they choose Gears 1. For the price I feel like if you still have interest in this game I would definitely buy again. If you have never played a gears game and you wanted to start this is a great place. Especially since in the next come months you will be able to play Gear 2 and 3 for free (Xbox 360 versions on Xbox one) this game gives you the opportunity to play the whole franchise for $40 or less depending on where you buy it. Definitely missing Horde mode right now.Multiplayer has felt fluid and of course you always have your pros who dominate, but that is every multiplayer game. Shooting characters in MP and having nothing happen is one of my favorite GOW memories (sarcasm). I would say the remaster and dedicated servers have improved greatly on that. Hopefully you enjoy Gears as much as I do. Great place to start before jumping into MP is the story for practice. This game has been out for years so there are some crazy good players. Great Game Wasn't good the first time around. Gears Of War the original was the reason I purchased an Xbox 360. I can still remember my first time seeing the Mad World commercial, turning off the tv and proceeding to the nearest Target. This remaster is a complete let down. As much as I have heard complaints about the Halo Master Chief Collection (Multiplayer, XBox Live, etc), the gameplay itself was solid. Which brings me to Gears. I could hardly play through the first 10 mins of this game. I looks like they just cobbled a bunch of higher resolution textures together and scripted it along with a few sound effects. This remaster is amateur at best.Sound.Horrible. Everything is level, the explosions, the voices and other effects have no depth. Its as if you are listening to the game through some tin cans. There is even  a slight echo in the character voices as if they are in a sound booth... smhEffects.Amateur. Here is an example of how poorly done the effects in the game are. I noticed that while shooting that the bullets seem to have the same travel and collision effect no matter how far the object I was shooting was. I shot a wall next to me and turned and shot a wall, a car, and even the ground distances ranging from near to far and it looks like the bullets go about 10ft and collide and disappear. The game also has poor depth perception between the characters. I would compare this to playing one of those poorly made javascript games online in your browser.Graphics.This is where the game stands out. While you are standing still the game looks beautiful. The visuals and imagery looks great, but moving around ruins this effect.Overall this game looks and feel last minute and rushed. As I type this, i cant help but have the feeling that the developers did not care to remake the actual campaign portion of the game and opted to dedicate all or their resources to the online multiplayer. This sucks because I can care less for the multiplayer aspect of the game. While people were picking up madden 16 at the midnight release on 8/25 at gamestop. I picked up gears of war ultimate edition... and I have to say this is well worth the $40. .. this game looks like a current gen game (not like some remastered games) this game runs at 1080p at 60fps on multiplayer and 1080p at 30fps in the campaign... and it's just completely gorgeous. It comes with full multiplayer (which you can spend hundreds of hours on) and the original campaign with fun/easy achievments.Oh and I forgot to mention if you buy this for $40 you get the gears ultimate edition, the gears of war saga (all 4 gears games digitally via backwards compatability) and  you get access to the gears of war 4 beta... this is a steal... buy now The Good:It's Gears of War, and it was fantastic when it came out. It's an extremely well done remake for the Xbox One, they did a great job with it.The Bad:It's -only- Gears of War. If you want the original game with no improvements aside from the graphics, that's what's included; but let's face it, the series came a long way in the sequels with massive improvements to everything from the controls to gameplay options. There's no Horde mode,  there's no bot matches, and so on.I love Gears, and it's a great nostalgia kick, but I don't think that's enough considering how good the old games still look on the 360 anyway.I feel bad giving this three stars, but after the rush of the reunion with an old friend it just made me miss Gears 3's gameplay instead. It's a well done remake, but it's just not a must-have without the improvements the sequels brought to the series. Awesome remaster!! The campaign is a bit dated but still enjoyable but where this game really shines is the multiplayer.  There is just something about the flow of the controls and the way it plays it is unmatched in my opinion. The maps are awesome and easy to learn. Best multiplayer in my opinion out of all 4 gears games. I was worried they were going to ruin the multiplayer by changing too much but they did not. I just starting playing this game. I pre-ordered after playing the 60 fps multiplayer beta. unfortunately THE GAME DOES NOT RUN AT 60 FPS. This is false advertising and a BOLD FACED LIE!!! I feel like everyone who bought this should sue microsoft for false advertising as there own store page says: &#34;Gears comes to Xbox One. Remastered, reimagined, and rebuilt for Xbox One, Gears of War returns in all its genre-defining glory. It comes packed with new content, including five campaign chapters never released on Xbox, and looks better than ever with everything running in 1080p at 60 FPS&#34;. &#34;EVERYTHING RUNNING AT 1080P 60FPS&#34;!!!!!!! Shame on you Microsoft. Your &#34;next gen&#34; hardware can barely run a 10 year old game at 30 fps. Pathetic! I cant believe how you are marketing the game as a 1080p 60 fps remake when it runs single player at 30 fps and multiplayer at a very inconsistent and juttery 45-60 fps. I want a full refund as this is not what you advertised to me when I bought It. This is a horrible remake of an amazing game. If you can do halo 4 at 60 fps why not gears?? it dosent even make sense. How could you release this trash.. Fans have been waiting for this remaster and this is what you give us?? I am furious right now... MICROSOFT.... PLEASE PLAY LAST OF US REMASTER FOR PS4.. that is how a remaster needs to be done. I frankly don't know why you even bothered or how you thought no one would notice how HORRIBLE this remaster is.. I AM SO UPSET RIGHT NOW.. HOW COULD YOU??????? Was boring the first time. The remaster is a joke. Seriously this series needs to die. Well it's gears. The graphics really stand out, especially in multiplayer. Yes the multiplayer does have some bugs that need to be fixed but at the end of the day, it's the gears that we would play on our 360. Love the game and can't wait for the rest of the games to be released. This game is pure fan service, thank you coalition for this phenomenal remaster. Sony u can learn alot from this, stop ripping people off with these so called remaster u feed ur ponies, god of war 3? Joke! Last of us remaster? Joke! Uncharted collection? Dont get me started.This collection they go all out, the graphics are amazing, reskined everything from the ground up. Including all the mp maps are redone from the ground up.The sound of the game is really great too. It now has 7.1  surround, the guns and the sound of the environment sound better than ever.The gameplay is the same classic Thur person cover based shooter u remember years ago.just more defined now.This is a great package to new and long time fana of the series. You get an extra chapter in the campaign that was on the PC, 19 maps and 7 game modes in the mp. Plus coop campaign. Unbelievable deal for 40 dollars. I highly recommend this game Great remaster and modernization of one of the 360's best titles. Wow gears is back better than ever with better graphics and smooth frame rate.visually it looks absolutely stunning.this set the standards again great job buy coalition and Microsoft. I thought Epic ruined Gears with Gears 3 and Judgement but this one really takes the cake. Why couldn't they just have upgraded the graphics and brought out the same game. The coalition and the entire gaming industry has been influenced and ruined by the Call of Duty series. Why make these games all like Call of Duty? For money yes. Dumb gamers love to just shoot and hold the trigger (lancers). Great gamers love a challenge like using a Gnasher shotgun but even that was ruined. In Judgement it was a marshmallow gun. In this current installment the hit detection is awful. I guess I'll just say goodbye to my dream of a Gears of War 2 without host because they would just ruin that to. I gave over 60 days of my life in game time to Gears 2 but after this awful showing I will not be buying a Gears gane again. They had an entire beta to realize the mistakes but what mistakes they did fix were small and irrelevant. Get back to understanding what your real Gears gamers want and have been asking for don't try to conform to the rest of the crowd. 60fps multiplayer is pretty sick, they've combined the better a couple elements of the later games and included them into the multiplayer (spotting, team death match, etc.). I think the game mechanics are that of the original but polished in all of the right places so you don't get stuck to walls and maintain very fluid gameplay. There are still some bugs that I'm sure we could do with out, but at this point it's only been out a day... Campaign is instant nostalgia, my only problem is that back when the game first came out the graphics were &#34;amaze-balls&#34; and today I play the remaster expecting more from the visuals, which in reality are a huge step above what they were and actually look pretty awesome. I suppose I'm just jaded... I have been playing The Witcher a lot. Still a bunch of blood, viscera, and chainsaws. Also if you play it before December you get download access to all 4 original Gears titles which you can play on Xbox One. Definite buy for Gears fans.The 4 out of 5 is due to the current buggy nature of multiplayer,  underpowered shotgun, and price. I think $30 would have been fair considering if you already have the other gears games you won't need the digital downloads offered later. First off my Amazon Pre Order didn't come with the Savage Theron Guard Multiplayer Skin, which is complete BS !  This is a multiplayer review (didn't play the campaign yet)  The game is feel is EXTREMELY CHOPPY ! From moving around the map, to picking up weapons, to fighting other players, complete chop.  Hit registration is really really really bad.  Players standing still (not playing), and it took me 3 gnasher shots for an instant kill.  I've fired boom shots directly at 2 player who both walked away unscathed.  In game chat was broken, had to go to a private chat, and you can't invite friends from within the game into lobbies.  It's 2015 fix the hit registration, no one wants a game where the out come is random.  The most disappointing thing about the game is the fact there's ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARY REPORT after rounds.  So when a match ends there's no game summary report card.  You have no idea how you, your team, or the opposing team did.  This is a must have in today's online multiplayer games.  Just like the MCC I get all hyped up for these re-masted games and I am left feeling disappointed. Gears of war is my favorite game of all time, i love playing this game, Coalition has done an outstanding job on remastering this game, they show more fan support than most game developers out there :) but for some strange reason i got Civilian Anya rather than Savage Theron since i preordered it from Amazon, so hopefully someone can help me or trade with me It's like playing a brand new game. The graphics overhaul and look are stunning. Probably the best looking game on the Xbox One so far. And, it plays wonderfully! This is the next best thing to getting a new 'Gears' game just with all the characters you love. Wow! While this remaster may not have the insane amount of content Halo:MCC has, it's still a very very well done remake. The graphics are solid and the framrate runs smoothly on both multiplayer and campaign. What makes this game stand out is the gameplay. In an era dominated by fist person shooters, Gears is a welcome alternative.Can't wait for Gears 4.Highly recommended to ANY Xbone owners. Back to where it all started either GOW 1. Still have host, but great game all around Gears of War 1 is the reason I started playing competitive online multiplayer. Sadly, the 'dedicated servers' aren't that dedicated in this game. My review is strictly the multiplayer because the story mode, if it's like the original Gears, is amazing. My friends and I are already level 24+ on the first day of release. That's how we game. With that said, the shotgun is all over the place with consistency. Some games, I'm popping heads off with a shotgun from far, almost like a sniper. This is both good and bad. Good for me obviously but bad for the balance of the game. I should not be able to do that. Now here's the flip side. Sometimes I'm on top of a guy, as he's picking up his teammate and nothing. No hit marks, no nothing and I get instant killed. Microsoft is probably releasing this game so they can get more people excited about Gears 4 because there's no reason to re-release a classic game besides money and momentum. Sadly this is slowly becoming a shell of Halo: The Masterchief Collection - full of problems. Microsoft needs to address this ASAP cause I'm slowly getting fed up with HMCC, this, the Xbox One party issues, etc. The Xbox 360 is more stable online than this. they call it Gears of War Ultimate Edition I thought all three games were going to be on the disc Gears of War first installment if that was the case I would never bought this Absolutely terrific remake.If you loved playing the original, you'll love this ultimate edition, which includes all the pc chapters, new visuals, and all-new mo-cap cutscenes.On top of that, you get all of the previous gears games as free backwards compatible games in addition to free access to the gears 4 beta!I sort of wish they had touched up some of the ai behaviors, but other than that, this game, so far, is an absolute must-buy! The graphics look great on the campaign mode---if you're just standing there. As soon as you begin to move, it's readily apparent that there hasn't been much of an improvement at all---it's just as clunky and jerky as the original, nearly unplayable. in fact, Gears Ultimate Edition (groan) gave me one HELL of a headache after the first two levels. 30 fps? More like .003. Ray Harryhausen would have laughed his rear end off.So they say the &#34;Versus&#34; Modes are at 60 fps. All right. I gave that a try, but by gosh and by darn, you can't play this game alone, in your house, by yourself, with bots as adversaries---not for love or money. You're now FORCED to wrangle a bunch of friends (none of mine were stupid enough to blow over 300 bucks on this lousy excuse for a console, so that leaves me out), or sadly and pathetically join a bunch of fifteen (or less) year old strangers on one of the Coalition's precious servers. No bots! No Horde Mode! None of the satisfaction that comes from beating the computer's brains out!  I realize not much of the last paragraph will mean anything to the average gamer, their only source of meaningful social contact being electronic gizmos and do-dads. I'm still of the old school---video games are things I do on my own when it's late, and I'm too lazy to do the things I ought to be doing. This ain't one of those types of games. I thought Gears 3 had some issues with the campaign, but at least you could see what was going on, the enemy died when you shot them, and Horde and Team Deathmatch could be played pretty much under any circumstances. I played in the Beta for GOWUE, and I had a feeling it would be like this. I sure wish I'd found a way to borrow one first. I'm ready to throw my Xbox One out with the morning rubbish. I've owned it since April of 2015, and there still aren't any good games for it.  Geez. Haven't played the campaign yet, so I'll update this later once I do. However I have played much of the multiplayer and can say it's definitely great. After owning my xbox one, and being extremely disappointed time and time again, from halo reach not being on MCC, to Goldeneye not being on Rare replay: I have been very bored.Finally, a brand new game that microsoft can finally get some money.Sadly, it is a complete rip off of The order 1886.Gameplay goes like this:DUCK...SHOOT...DUCK....SHOOT...DUCK....SHOOT...Sounds fun right? Repeat that for 40 hours and you have this awful game 0/6 stars worst game ever created in the history of man I hope enjoyed my review. Better than before Greatest game ever Game is awesome on the Xbox One. The only game on the disk is the original but if you read what it says you do get them all when the backward compatibility for GOW is released in the fall for free. EPIC! didn't get Preorder code. Supposed to be mailed. I suggest contacting Amazon.The game looks better than ever. It does feel the same as Gears of war 1 control wise. Which is good or bad depending on how much you like or dislike the controls compared to the later titles from Gears of war 1. This means you could shot someone with a boomshot or throw a grenade at their feet and they make it out alive. gears of war 1 was a great game but had audio issues and sometimes choppy moments but here its full 60 fps awesome glory. Its the same game with a other multiplayer modes you'd seen from Gears of war 3 for an example. If you like Gears of war(series) and tired of playing it on on the xbox 360 then try it here. It looks so much better.this is also my what I was told for contacting Amazon regarding my Pre-orderAdam, I'm forwarding your concern to our games specialized team. If you are eligible to get the code games support team will certainly look into this and get back to you with code via email in next 1-2 business days.I've forwarded your issue regarding pre-order bonus code for Savage Theron Guard Skin to the Games Specialized team to handle this issue. You should hear back from them in the next 1-2 business days. i wish i never bought this game. This game is the biggest disappointment i have ever felt with a game. You can't do meat shield, grenade tag a wall,or two piece. If anybody sniped you, is an automatic headshot. I feel tricked into thinking that i would get every gears of war collection, but all i get is the first Gears of war. Why would a company even make the first Gears of war when in reality Gears of war 2 was the best seller out of all the series. i wish i could get my money back but i bought the digital copy of this game, never again will i buy a digital copy of any game (unless is &#34;the last of us 2&#34;) . The best gears game so far I wasn't going to buy this game as I had already played it on the 360 and am not the nostalgia gaming type. Last minute I decided to buy the digital version as I had credit in my MS account and started playing it this morning. First of all the developers have done a labor of love in the restoration of this game, it feels fresh and the graphics and cut scenes are amazing. But most importantly the way it plays reminded me of why GOW was ground breaking at the time and why we all went so crazy about it: incredibly fun to play shooter that literally brought a smile to my face this morning, over and over. Haven't tried coop nor multiplayer yet but cannot wait to later on this week! In my opinion a must have for FPS fans, no matter whether you have played it before or not. Almost a decade ago the original gears came out revolutionizing the gaming industry and setting a new bar for next gen multiplayer gaming. It was the first game to allow you to do in multiplayer exactly what you could do in campaign. It had amazing graphics for its time and  revolutionizing gameplay. This is the version of the game the developers would've loved to release since Emergence Day 2006. Graphics are improved, amazing and so smooth. The gameplay is the same as the original gears (No crazy weapons or frag tagging walls like later gears). A must have for any fan of the series or noobs alike. I don't blame you if you run around chainsawing opponents the first few hours. The ultimate fan service thank you Microsoft and the coalition because of you gears and back and better than ever. I've played through the campaign once so far on normal my next go is insane cutscenes are gorgeous, graphics are upgraded but what we loved and remembered about gears hasn't changed and that's what is most important to us gear heads. This is how I know it is a great game... not only is the campaign a fun experience.. online is still fun even if you suck for the most part like I do.", "It's a yarn Yoshi, and it's pink. Pretty cute. Love the item and good price but package was damaged Perfect just as described.  Fast Shipping. Its Yoshi, and he is made out of yarn. You know you want it.", "Excellent device, really useful to store a harddrive and have front USB ports. After alot of trial and error finally got it to work. Fits perfectly and happy with my purchase. If you have an Xbox 1, you got to have one of these. Works as promised, just use the blue USB cable to format the hard drive (once you have it in the device) Then put the device on your Xbox. It should read your hard drive when you snap it on. I was excited to get this installed since it would replace my 2TB external drive I had just sitting on top of my Xbox One. I had planned to take apart the external 2TB drive and use the hard drive inside to put into this enclosure. What I did not know was that my WD My Passport  had a proprietary usb adapter built onto the hard drive controller so there was no sata controller board. Fortunately I had an extra hard drive from my laptop which is a WD black slim 1TB SSHD. This hard drive has been working great compared to the external I was using. When I had games installed to the external they would lag hard which I had blamed the hard drive speed for since when the games were installed to the internal drive they would not lag as much. The enclosure was a little difficult to attach to the side of the console but once I figured out how the clips work it was not that bad. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is the button on the side that is supposed to press the sync button on the console does not work at all. I liked it!", "works great It has become frayed as easily as the pack in cord. Not as strong as psp charger. FRIGGIN LOVELY! Great length and works perfectly.", "Super nice base. It shoulb be a little more wide to add a littler more balance when the ps4 is in it. But nothing bad. Good product. Awsome Our PS4 started to overheat and I ordered this sucker ASAP!! It is AWESOME!!", "My 7 year old daughter and I love this game. We are slowly working our way through it. So much to do, it doesn't get boring and can play for months. Best baby sitter ever! Warning, may increase your child's attention span by up to 30 seconds! Awesome game.  Our 7 year old son LOVES it.  The Lego games are high quality and I'm impressed with them.  :) My nephews and I love to play lego games. And this one is no exception.  It has a lot of superheroes and bad guys. Very nice to play. The only lego games that it did not like so far is indiana jones 2 (a little boring). The Indiana Jones 01 is awesome.  And the other one I found boring one was the lord of the rings. I have not played hobbit.... or jurassic or lego the movie.... Batman 3 is also very good, but it has some levels copied from batman 2. Do not feel astonished.  And it has a different structure... also very very fun for the ones who like this type of game. Awesome! Super fun for all ages. Totally fun and awesome game. No scratches on the disc. The case was wrapped in plastic. I bought this for my 8 year old brother but I try to play just as often and I'm an adult. Gift for nephew. He loves Lego and Marvel so he's extremely happy. Thx! Shipping was faster than expected and delivery was made on Sunday!", "Do you need a review for the PS4!!! great Excellent 100% recomendado great system, fast delivery Saved up for a long time to get one, ended up getting a pre-owned from Game Stop and I love it. My mom finds it stupid seeing as how I had just saved up and gotten a PS3 for my birthday just months ago. It runs so much faster than PS3. The price is crazy, but if you love games, and PS get it. It's worth it. For me it was really what games were on it or going to be on it. A lot of the games I like are PS only.It was funny though, game stop doesn't whip the hard drive, so the one I got had TONS of downloaded games I could play. And I'm not talking the free games you can get on the Nintendo e-store kind. Really good well known pricey games. Sadly most of them I didn't like and had to delete for more space for my own. :/ Great product Everything in order package arrived fast you should add more description  of the item next time perfect perfect perfect As I expected from Sony. If you want a real system stick with a last gen system or Xbox one or game PC unless you want a system with constant crashes and your personal information stolen Something is wrong with my system I need help. Hours of fun played. I hope my particular console life gets 10 or more years.", "this is a fun little game for the family the only issue I have was that upon ordering this game it did not say any where that it could only be played using the motions control paddle and a &#34;eye&#34;.  which I ended up buying for a total of three time the cost of the game, However I have a feeling other games I order in the future will need the motion control paddle, and I'm sure I can find many uses for the &#34;eye&#34;.  I have NOT yet played any of this but have read about it and I'm sure I will enjoy the games.", "Easiest, most sensible, hassle-free application of a screen protector I have ever seen. Wish more companies made screen protector application this simple. No air bubbles, screen protector is solid, fits gamepad perfectly, & touchpad fully functional. Super easy to apply!", "Don't buy if you're a collector like myself. The seller shows the black case but ships the red greatest hits version -__-. The game is great. EVeryone knows it. It's fantastic.The physical product is where I complain. The case came damaged, it was broken, the protection was not enough. It caused the booklet-manual to bent. Also I was expecting for the standard edition of the game instead of the &#34;greatest hits&#34; one, which is very ugly. Well, the important part is that I have the game disc and LET'S ENJOY THIS AWESOME GAME!", "There are some sports that are better live than on TV. Some of the intensity of hockey is lost on TV, the relaxation of watching a baseball game on a nice day surpasses sitting in the living room. But sometimes the commentary adds a lot to the game. A bit of context, some history, something you wouldn\u2019t get being at the game itself. I\u2019ve played, and enjoyed, each of the Batman Arkham games that have come out. Arkham Knight is no different. It has an open world to explore, the same melee style combat and stealth action as previous games. There are a few additions to the game. A heavy dose of Batmobile, an overhaul of the game world into utter chaos, a new hierarchy of villains and a more involved cast of supporting characters. It\u2019s the same style game revamped, and a little darker than previous installments. The game picks up with the death of the Joker from Arkham Origins. It\u2019s Halloween of the following year and after a threat to the city everyone but the police force evacuates as gangs and militia take over. The primary adversary through the game is the Arkham Knight, a militaristic, unknown villain who leads a mercenary army into Gotham under the direction of Scarecrow who is trying to release a massive dose of fear gas into the city. There are two big additions to the game. The well-advertised, and a bit controversial Batmobile which can be switched between a high powered sports car and a tank. While the tank combat is enjoyable, though fairly easy since enemies telegraph their attacks, the heavy reliance on the Batmobile can become cumbersome. Flying from rooftop to rooftop is both enjoyable and quicker than driving through Gotham\u2019s winding streets most of the time, but there are numerous sections of the game where the Batmobile is shoe-horned into the gameplay. Open up an area, go back for the Batmobile to open up the next section, rinse and repeat. While the car adds some nice variety to the game it can act like an anchor, slowing down gameplay by making you use it. The other big addition to the game is the Joker as a supporting character. This, to me, is the more enjoyable of the additions though it doesn\u2019t really add anything to the gameplay. Through events in the game the Joker becomes part of Batman\u2019s psyche, visible and audible to Batman, but no one else. He provides commentary on events and pokes at Batman\u2019s actions. While the games are fun of their own right, the color commentary really adds something special to the game. It provides greater context of the events and humor in an otherwise serious game. The world is very similar to the past two installments in the series, Arkham City and Arkham Origins, a sprawling cityscape of Gotham. The game takes place over the course of a single night so it\u2019s always dark and raining from beginning to end. The main difference in the world is that the city has erupted into utter chaos. In the previous games gangs roved the city, but Arkham Knight takes it to another level as a militarized force has moved into the city alongside the normal array of gangs filling the city streets and making it more likely to run into a fight going from point A to point B. The normal array of hand to hand combat and stealth carries over from the previous games. You swing from rafter to rafter or crawl through ducts taking out enemies one by one silently until you burst out, or the more likely scenario for me is being seen, for hand to hand combat. The same array of gadgets are available to you as previous games in the series, the bat claw, the disruptor for turning off weapons, smoke pellets, you get the idea, with a few new additions like a voice modulator, which really just put up more walls to progression that you unlock through the story. There is a new fear take down mechanism that allows you to do multiple takedowns in a short period, along with a series of new automated enemies such as drones you can hack and automatic turrets you must avoid. As mentioned before the Batmobile is now playable and there is a good amount of tank combat which is nimble and enjoyable. You steer the Batmobile which is able to move in all directions quickly, while you combat automated tanks which telegraph their attacks with light beams that change color when they have a lock. It makes the combat a bit simplistic, but it\u2019s a nice change of pace from the normal melee combat you usually encounter in the games. The graphics look great. The city is dark and ominous. The characters are well rendered and the voice acting is still superb. The main complaint I have with the presentation is there are times where Batman\u2019s mouth doesn\u2019t move while speaking. There is a ton of side content, but it can be a little annoying. While the content itself is well-done, it involves finding it. Sometimes radio banter will alert you to where the event is, but even with that it can be difficult to locate at times. It would be nice if once you get a clue as to where the content is it would mark it, but it doesn\u2019t. Sometimes I would hear some banter that would alert me. I would fly in the direction indicated but not see where the event was and there wouldn\u2019t be any more banter. Arkham Knight is a great game in its own right. It\u2019s another high-quality installment in a great series. But the addition of the Joker to provide commentary really puts things over the top. It may not actually add anything to the gameplay, but getting a glimpse at Batman\u2019s thoughts and insecurities is a great added bonus to the game. The commentary may not be a focal point, it may not be something any focused on, but it really adds something to the game. It can help fill in the gaps, it can help bring things alive, it can help give a glimpse at something I wouldn\u2019t have been able to see otherwise. It also makes up for some of the short comings that have arisen with the new mechanics. The additional barriers to progression you have to unlock, having to hunt down side content or the sometimes overzealous use of the Batmobile. Game is fun.. just didn't have time to enjoy it with all the missions. Great 16th Birthday present! My son loved it! This is simply the best game in the arkham franchise the graphics are great and the story is dark and heart clenching at times. the gameplay is great but the stealth sections with the batmobile suck but other than that the batmobile is great and you get cool skins on the ps4 version. Great game, awesome addition to the series. The included DLC works and won't expire till 2025 (I am not kidding) so even if you're buying this months from now you'll still get the free content. Best game ever Two ways to think about this game: 1. change the combat system as it is getting a little stale. or 2. keep the system as it is tried and true and still fun. Over the course of like 4 Batman games, I am leaning toward 1 away from 2. Now does that mean this game isn't good? No, it is awesome and the intro of the Batmobile makes it feel way cooler. But it is so predictable and I am getting way to good at taking down whole screens full of bad guys because the combat system is so predictable. Maybe I should just play less Batman games.... Brand new game...great price and works great! I have played this game for about 4 hours and absolutely hate it.  I'll take other reviewers word that the Batmobile is involved in 80% of the game.  I can't believe that the Batmobile is driven with a little bitty joystick on the game controller instead of the controller itself as in many actual driving games: Motor Storm to name just one.  Driving with the little bitty joystick totally ruined the game for me and I have no intention of wasting any more of my life becoming highly frustrated and aggravated over a stupid video game.  Also no instructions came with the game which is also frustrating.  Continually stopping the game to view the games 'controller' functions to see what set of buttons need to be used for any given function.  HORRIBLE!!!  DO NOT BUY. Excellent product and seller! Awesome. Forced batmobile encounters diminished the fun a little bit :( Absolutely wonderful game! I'm not a hard core gamer, but I am a 40 year old who loves a good batman game. Amazon prime, as usual, can be counted on. In two days after order I was screeching along streets in the coolest batmobile ever! Thanks Amazon. Very nice video game !! From the very opening cut of the game I was in love.  Batman could not look any better.  His cape, suit, and the overly dramatic way he lands on the ground look great.  I felt like I was actually gliding around Gotham City.  Gotham City never looked and felt better.  You end up using detective mode for the majority of the game, but with all of the batman games it's not a big deal.  There is nothing like using detective mode and do a silent takedown of a bad guy.  Throw in the fear multitude takedown you feel like you're batman and that's a very cool thing.  I did find myself comparing this to Assigns Creed, which isn't a bad thing either.  You spend most of the time upgrading your suit, batmobile/tank weapons, and gadgets.  I found that some gadgets were'nt a big deal to upgrade.  I loved using the disruptor gun and upgrading my fear takedowns to the highest level.  I ended up having a love/hate relationship with the batmobile.  Driving the batmobile through the streets, running through anything on the streets collecting no damage to the car is a lot of fun.  Even the out of place batmobile to tank mode seemed odd for a batman game.  They were fun but also very frustrating when you had a missile lock on you constantly in the middle of a battle.  I would accidently push in the L3 a little hard in combat and the tank will go to more of a first person mode and totally create confusion.  Then throw in the riddler challenges that used the batmobile, began to become more frustrating than fun.  Then the car chases just became annoying.  But I still love the game.  My only real complaint is too much batmobile.  The control mechanics for the batmobile are totally messed up.  I shouldn't have to change the controller configuration to make the batmobile feel more comfortable.  The fighting combat is very easy to get used to and stealth is what batman is all about.  Then adding the joker, penguin, scarecrow, two-face, and other notable villians make this one a batman game explosion.  Whether you like the batmobile or not, this is a great game that sucks you into Gotham City.  With the batmobile being what it is in the game, I give the game a 4.5 out of 5.sion.  Whether you like the batmobile or not, this is a great game that sucks you into Gotham City.  With the batmobile being what it is in the game, I give the game a 4.5 out of 5. Excellent Truly a good and compelling game. Lost of nice twists in the story make it very exciting to play. Seem to be plenty to do within the game so not as short as everyone made it sound. I missed out on the first two games of this series but still picked up whats going on just fine and am enjoying it very much. Highly recommend", "We can't live without our wireless controllers! Works like a charm Works perfectly! On time. Brand new. I had to buy another controller with the 3.5mm jack but still like this one so that my kids can enjoy their minecraft. NICE So far so good. Controller looks nearly brand-new. Tested it and everything works just fine. they work great, packaged well, no issues my son and partner are having fun playing together since getting this controller.  Works fine. hahha well let me tell you something this is garbage compared to PS4 controller it didn't even light up like the ps4 controller and it's worse that the 360 controller analog sticks too tight so goodnight luck on shooters that need scratch accuracy I mean on my god Excellent! A bit too many buttons for a girl. But still, excellent! Overall this is an excellent controller (even better now that they upgraded the description on the page).  This controller does not come with the 3.5mm headphone jack like the new controllers do.  So you will need to buy the adapter that goes into the bottom of the controller if you want to use your headset.  Otherwise, a very functional and reliable controller that I am pleased to have purchased. The controller works, but it was probably broken and &#34;fixed.&#34; The controller has obviously been opened, the thumb stick isn't as solid as normal, and there is a chip where it was pried open. There is also a broken piece rattling around inside. Grandson's happy I'm happy... The product arrived on time, as expected. It works. Can't ask for more. Good. Works great few days after using found out my microphone doesn't fit into this controller. like the mic jack is messed up Really great. So much fun playing game with my kids. Genuine product, real deal. Works awesome!", "this gave the same 6-10 hours of battery life for my PS4 controller as the default 1000mah battery, so i can only assume this is actually a 1000mah battery. Worked great and was very easy to install, I saved a lot of money by replacing the battery instead buying a whole new controller. UPDATE: The problem with this battery not holding a charge seems to have a lot to do with how you charge it. Simply charging it from the PS3 wasn't enough, it seems. Not sure if it was a voltage or amperage problem, but either way, here's how mine came back to life. I plugged into a battery pack [[ASIN:B00QOEVMPS Tzumi Pocket Juice 2200 Mah USB Recharge]] so I wouldn't be tied to the console. I noticed a few days later that the battery pack was off (does this automatically), but the controller was still on. It's been unplugged for several days now, and it's all good. Played several hours yesterday with vibe on and it's still on. If your battery has &#34;died&#34;, save your cash for later and hook up to something like a tablet charger or external battery pack.Original review:Almost lasted a year (bought it 9 Aug 14). Was great for a while, then needed to be charged constantly. A month or two ago it died completely. It is WAY cheaper than buying another controller, so as unthrilled as I am to be replacing it already, at least it was cheap. I will be trying another brand, but I honestly expect the same result. Again, still much cheaper than the whole shebang.", "They go to my 60 inch Samsung flat screen n my PS3 now that's a plus thanks for the amazing product bro Works fine works so far. will update if last less 5 months", "This review is based on the game, not the contents (Boba Fett, etc..)I've been a fan of this series since the original (1.0),  and if you go for the the 3.0 starter set on any platform, you will soon find out just how well your money was spent. With each release, Disney manages to stuff their game with so many things to do, and 3.0 takes this further with a mind-boggling amount of content to tackle.  Long after many AAA hardcore games are completed, Disney Infinity will keep chugging along with something new to find. Having Star Wars to bring in their latest series was a no-brainer for Disney - and everyone predicted it would happen.  I'm happy to say, Disney went into overdrive with this release as they have done the Star Wars license mighty justice.  The gameplay is spot on this time with fun quests and tons of side missions. Unlike the previous Marvel Super Heroes, Star Wars's missions vary from ground  to space, keeping the adventures fresh at all time. The combat is highly improved with spectacular moves that are more complex and satisfying. I mean, come on - lightsabers? That's all you need to know.  Both Twilight of the Republic and Rise against the Empire are equally enjoyable, and even after completion, you'll be back to revisit and will find much more to do.Back on Earth, without even firing up one of the Star Wars Playsets, you'll find an overwhelming amount to explore, thanks to the Toy Hub (not to be confused with the Toy Box). The Hub is the center for everything.  It's segmented like a pie, with one section for racing, another combat, platforming, etc.. Each section has an intro level and sub levels that you can play which introduce you to the game's mechanics. It's brilliantly put together. One particular area host a farming simulator for your sidekicks. Oh, sidekicks are mini-sized Disney characters that hang with you during your questing. They can be told to follow and fight along, or farm for vegetables and other surprises. As your crops grow, you can feed your sidekicks to increase their stats. Better stats equals more abilities like cooler weapons, and other interesting gear. It really adds an RPG feel to the infinity series, and those little folk are pretty kick butt in battle! When I first heard about farming being added to the series, I was scratching my head, but from what I heard, people are spending hours just in that section alone!The Disney Main Street area of the hub is a sight to behold, and it's here where you can stop at Flynn's Arcade (of Tron fame) to jump into some on-line multiplayer games, or hang out at the El Capitan theater and play community levels, or even watch videos based around the game. Trust me when I say, the Hub is going to keep you real busy.  And finally, there's the Toybox, the heart of the Disney Infinity empire.This time around, the ToyBox has received a lot of new gadgets and scenery, so expect an abundance of community levels that utilize the new features.Besides the two Star Wars PlaySets, there is currently a third which is based on Pixar's awesome animated movie,  Inside Out. This takes a different approach than the other sets, as it brings pure 2D/3D platforming bliss to the table, and dazzling it is!  Then there are the two expansion games. Unlike the playsets, which come with characters and an adventure crystal, these expansions are just a special single disc. When dropped on the portal, they add an all new game to the already massive mix; currently, there are two:  Toybox Takeover which is a dungeon crawler where any Disney/Marvel/Star Wars Character can quest , and the highly touted DI Speedway, which is a Mario Kart-like racing game. All these sets unlock even more toys to add to the already massive selection in the Toybox.  Oh, and if that wasn't enough, there's more DI goodness coming down the pike later later this year,  including a new playset based on the upcoming, highly anticipated movie in the Star Wars saga,  The Force Awakens, and an all out brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.With all the excellence that is 3.0, there are a few things that I feel need attention:- Saving a game on the Disney Cloud using the PS4 is still super slow. I'm not sure how is is on other formats.- Some of the tools in the Toybox I thought would have made the jump to light speed like the rest of the game, instead, they remain the same, like the yellow trigger cube which is cumbersome to resize.- The Toybox still restricts certain actions to a certain type of toy. For example, if you want a particular object to be &#34;collectible&#34; in a quest, you can only use what the developers chose as a collectible item. At least there's a better selection than last year.- This year's amazing new path creator is great for making objects follow an assigned path. It will surely take community games to a whole new level. The first thing that came to my mind when I read about the Path Tool's capabilities was ROLLERCOASTERS! Well, turns out - there's no coaster track,  train track, or even a coaster car. There are coaster sounds effects, though? Odd, right?In closing, there are so many features with Disney Infinity 3,0, it would be painful to have to write a review and list them all.

In closing, there are so many features with Disney Infinity 3,0, it would be painful to have to write a review and list them all. Whether you're 6 or 65, you're in for one of the big gaming treats of 2015. We have been playing Disney infinity since the very beginning 1.0. We have all of the consoles but our 1.0 and 2.0 are both Xbox 360. The Playstation saga bundle we decided to change to because of the benefits in this bundle. All of our characters and play sets from previous games that we used exclusively on 360 work well on this game so no worries there. It just pops up that you have registered the figure on a previous game and asks if you want to add it. The picture is upgraded and looks crisp on 1080 p. My husband and daughter have been playing for 2 hours in the new toy box going through different good guys, bad guys, and vehicles. We bought the toy box expansion and they have not even started it yet. Having so much fun in the toy box. You can play Disney radio music (may use Internet?) streaming music. The toy box comes with a dispenser that gives you multiple cars, scenes from places like gravity falls wreck it Ralph, and good guys and bad guys. Minnie Mouse is a huge hit because she skips around and uses her purse(disclaimer we bought Minnie, Mickey, Olaf, and the inside out characters they do not come with this bundle). We did not preorder so the toy box takeover expansion was an extra 20.99.This set comes with 3.0 softwarecharacters:Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Boba FettTwilight of the Republic play set pieceRise against the Empire play set piece3 web codes-starter pack, rise against the empire, and Boba Fett1 Disney infinity base (we now have 3)I was unsure of upgrading but it was worth it. It is hard to not say too much. I do not want to spoil anything for anyone. We have had so much fun exploring it. This game was worth the wait! I love it!", "kids love it My grandson loved it love minecraft Kids like it. Great game i love mincraft for my ps3", "Awesome! Bought it as a gift for my cousin who loves to play computer games and he absolutely likes it. This is the best saler of games", "I have fallen in love with this amiibo and it arrived in a timely fashion, in perfect condition. Thanks! WORKS GREAT Good condition. Not a fake.", "great Pros - More Monsters, Good Amount of replay value, Good musical score,Characters and NPC's you might g.a.s., Protagonist that looks decent.Cons - Sprites are pretty blocky, Areas are kind of retreads from previous generations, Can't use old monsters until you beat the game.Overall - Adventure is long and you feel like you're the silent main character visiting a familiar land and kicking the asses of guys in hoods all while being the best there is at training pocket sized monsters. Only thing better than that is a sequel. Oh wait!", "LIke the armor.  Just took awhile to get as it was one back order. Great product", "great A really fun addition to the Smash Bros. series. Not too many different modes to play in but online is a blast. kid liked it I am truly amazed at what Nintendo was able to accomplish with this game on the 3DS. The game runs very smoothly. It looks like a home console release. The graphics are really impressive given what they had to work with. I got this game today, so I'll be updating when anything new comes up, but otherwise, the main part of the review will be right here.Gameplay: The gameplay is great. There really isn't much else to say. You beat up famous Nintendo characters, and it is some of the best fun you'll have on the 3DS. The characters play at a smooth 60fps, it really amazes me. If you get an Assist Trophy, or throw a Pokeball, the character that comes out of it will only be doing their animations at 30 frames per second. However, you really don't notice all that much, it's not like they are there for very long anyways. I believe you can customize the controls, but they are pretty much perfect as is, aside from one issue. You cannot use the d-pad to move, you can only use the circle pad. I am a d-pad kind of person when it comes to games of the fighting variety, so this is a negative for me. The d-pad is used for taunts instead.Story: There isn't one, much to my disappointment. I really enjoyed the Subspace Emissary of Brawl, at least what I played of it. It would be a HUGE plus if they had a story on this iteration of Smash, but that is sadly not the case. There is a lot of potential, especially with all of these new characters that have been added. This is probably three quarters of a star taken away, if not more.Other Modes: Normal Smash. You just fight. It sounds really boring, but just thinking about it makes me want to get off the computer, pop the cartridge in the slot and play it before finishing the review. There's a multiplayer option, but I'll get into that a bit later. There is Smash run, which is fun but a bit hard. You go around a dungeon thingy and collect powerups, then after 3 minutes you fight using those power ups. It is quite fun, and is exclusive to the 3DS version, if I am not mistaken. There is classic mode, where you choose a character and fight some pre selected enemies until you get to the final boss. Those can be difficult as well. There are a few other modes, but there are too many to get into.Wii U: I believe you can use the 3DS as a controller on the Wii U version of the game, but I don't own a Wii I, so I can't say anything about this.Streetpass: There is Streetpass functionality for this game, but I have yet to encounter a fellow Smasher on the street.,Online: This is where problems are...existent. There are 2 main modes: For Glory and For Fun. For Glory is where your battle stats are recorded and put in a leaderboard and all that. No items or anything like that. For Fun is just like normal Smash, but it is with online players. Smash Run can be played with LOCAL multiplayer, meaning somebody close by who also owns a copy of the game.  I only played For Fun, and boy was it hard. Not because of the fellow players and their skills, because of the RIDICULOUS lag. The lag can range from playable to 'turn the game off' bad. My first match was not possible to play. It took 30 seconds for any input I made to actually register. The worst part is that the other players seemed fine, and as a result I ended up getting ganged up on. The frames per second were so low, it looked like the world's oldest turtle was doing a slideshow of pictures from the game. The other matches were playable, but it still wasn't possible to win. It took 2 to 3 seconds for input to register, and the frames were tolerable except for a little freezing. But 2 to 3 second input lag is not acceptable when it comes to a fast paced game like Super Smash Bros. My point is: local multiplayer with somebody right next to you, you get the Wii U version.In short, the game is very very fun, and it is amazing what Nintendo was able to do with such limited hardware. Butfor online matches, it would be best to look at the Wii U version of the game. And there's no story mode.for online matches, it would be best to look at the Wii U version of the game. And there's no story mode. It's smash, but you can carry it in your pocket. This is a great game to pick up and play at any time. It may not have the graphics or enormous music selection of the Wii U, but it definitely stands out as one of the best Smash Bros. games. The highlight for me was Smash Run, which kept me entertained for several months. However, Smash 3DS does suffer from the lack of several crucial single-player game modes, such as adventure mode, event match, and story mode. In the end this problem is balanced out by the phenomenal core gameplay in regular Smash mode, as well as the plethora of stages and DLC content. Great game It's not bad, the Smash Run is the best part of the game as it alternates between platforming and combat stages, but the game just feels like a bad port of the Wii U version in most aspects. For one the stages are smaller and the graphics are pretty bad. Online is also horrendously laggy at times which is what really kills it for me. When I do have a stable match it can be a lot of fun but overall I can't shake the feeling that this was a lazy port job to cash in those who wanted the game as early as possible or didn't have a Wii U. It's super fun to play with friends I brought this for my brother and he loves it ! Works just fine First off, the roster. It has over 50 characters, including Mario, Link, Pikachu, Kirby, Samus, Sonic, Donkey Kong, Mega Man, and even Pac-Man. Of course I'm not going to list everyone but those are some of the most recognizable ones. By far the biggest and best roster in the entire series. Everyone that should be there is.Next one's pretty important, the physics. It's absolutely nowhere near the fast paced, aggressive style of Melee. There's hitstun, but only a little bit, meaning that you'll only be able to truly combo at low percents since they'll be hit closer to you. Everybody still floats like a piece of paper, and you have unlimited air dodges. Shields are nearly indestructible and regenerate very quickly, and you can shieldgrab pretty much everything. So defensive gameplay is the norm, which I real hate but eh. You just have to adjust and you'll be fine.Online: It's terrible. Unless of course everyone you play has good Internet. You can set up a room for your friends, send and view replays or play one of the 2 main modes: For Fun and For Glory. For Fun is a lagfest where you play will all items on for 2 minutes. Most people just go there to do &#34;taunt parties&#34; where they just mess around and not attack each other. You can try to crash the party but you'll just get ganged up on. For Glory is a 1v1, 2 stock battle which is still a little bit laggy but not unbearable. I much prefer this on the 3DS version since the 3DS doesn't use tags, which Wii U people can use to swear at you after you beat them. The worst they can do on the 3DS version is furiously flash their name by choosing a character over and over.Game modes: Way better than the Wii U version because 2 words: Smash. Tour. Smash Tour is an absolute blast. You fight a bunch of different enemies while collecting stat boosts across a huge map. At the end you'll either do some sort of Smash match, have a race, or climb a tower to decide the winner. I seriously consider this a reason to get this over the Wii U version since all it has is some slow boring board game called Trash Tour. Other modes are Home Run contest, where you try to hit a sandbag as far as possible (Pst, use Ganonorf and use his reverse B instead of the bat) and Target Blast, which is pretty much launching a bomb bird from Angry Birds. You have to hit a bomb to break wooden obstacles for the best score.As usual there's Classic Mode and All Star like all Smash games. This time in classic mode, you set the difficulty on a scale of 0.0 to 9.0, much like Kid Icarus Uprising (Sakurai bias lel) and each round you have to choose one of three paths.And now there's DLC. It's kinda overpriced in my opinion ($2 per stage, $5 per character) but LUCAS IS BACK so I doesn't freaking matter.Amiibos are basically just a CPU you can train yourself. It'll also give you cool stuff, like gear and trophies. You can go get a Mario amiibo at WalMart for about $12. Don't worry there's a billion of 'em. If you want any other character you can get them from those lovely scalpers for around 60-70 bucks.This game also introduces custom moves, which lets you change a character's B move (Ex: Changing Mario's Fireball to Fast Fireball) and give them equipment, which you can use to make them faster, stronger, or more defensive.You can save pictures by pausing the game and pressing L/R. All of your pictures are saved to the album AND 3DS Camera. You can attach that picture to make a Miiverse post (Don't expect anyone to notice it since the Snapshot Community is dead)And of course, it's portable. Smash anywhere. It's awesome.

After a week it just collects dust, unless you love fighting games alot. Good graphics and well put together as a game...everything works...if you like fighter games this should keep you busy for a bit... This is the best fighting game period. ps4 game ..", "Excellent recommend 100% My daughter loves it. We got this used and the kids love it.  Only problem we have is that the kids can play single player all day long but as soon as they put a second player on the base the ps3 resets...", "This is the worst WWE game. Full of glitches. Seems haphazardly put together for the sake of having a WWE game released once a year. Can't get past the opening screen because 2 songs are playing at the same time. Trading in for something better. What a waste. Another Prime Day Fail. It was great Nice Game my nephew liked a lot really good price10+", "I got it for the same price as the others in the promotional deal. It was $2 without shipping, but $6 after shipping.I really like this mouse, and honestly I wasn't expecting to. The cable is nicely braided and about 6 feet long. It's long enough to stretch about 3 feet from my tower to my desk, and still have plenty of slack. The LED lighting is nicely colored and visible, without being bright to the point of blinding at night. However, my favorite thing is how the mouse sits in my hand. On my Cooler Master Storm mouse, I have to have a bit of a claw grip for it to fit properly, but this sits great.As for the mouse pad, it's nice, but I don't really know what to look for in mouse pads. It sits well on my desk, it's decent sized, and doesn't slide around at all. I got this mouse for only $2 using a product code the company gave me. I couldn't be happier with the purchase considering the price I paid for it. It's very well designed and fits very nicely in my hand. It has a sensitivity adjuster, back and forward buttons, and a x3 click button. I only have two slight negatives to say, the sensitivity of the scroll wheel feels a little stiff, and the mouse pad it comes with can be a little too large for some people. Got this for what I can only describe as an insanely good promotional deal. I honestly wasn't expecting much for the price but the button configuration is reminiscent of the Logitech MX510 of yore (which I loved). The rotating LED color scheme is pretty cool and my girlfriend enjoys playing Diablo 3 with this mouse. 5 stars! Nice build quality. Awesome Led color changes. and just an all around great buy for the price!", "The best game available on ps4 and one of the best games ever. Best ps4 exclusive. Not for a casual gamer though Nice game. Really fun game Game sucks. One of the best games I have ever played. Every single time I play it I love it just as much as the first time. If you're a Souls fan or want to get into the Bloodborne series I highly recommend it if you have some time on your hands as it is quite a long game. This game has a great potential.  But lack of save option make it mindlessly repetitive.  Killing the same enemies again, again, and again quickly turn challenge and fun into extremely boring chores.  The best review of this particular problem is done by Dan Stapleton in his article &#34;HOW AND WHY BLOODBORNE LOST ME&#34; on www.ign.com.  I strongly suggest reading this article prior to buying this game.  As for me I'm definitely trying to trade this game for something else. Mehhh I don't get all the hype. This game is very difficult unless you are following a walk through. Every time you die you gotta go back to the checkpoint and lose 25 minutes of work. Kind of an annoying game to play. It was a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. Great quality great graphics! Game came perfectly sealed. Good price too. Magnificent It was hard but I enjoyed it started a second Pau through. The best exclusive this generation so far. Great game. Love this game Best game for PS4 buy it I got this for my fiance as a birthday gift and now he ignores me because he's always playing this. He tells me &#34;you knew this would happen&#34; and I guess he's right. Do you like your blood pressure where it is? Would you prefer to avoid irreparable damage to your psyche and frequent bouts of rage? Then buy this. it's a very relaxing canoe ride through Victorian England or whatever that place is supposed to be. Great game. Tough as nails, almost to tough.  I have quit multiple times, but always find myself going back for more punishment. This is a great game but honestly has to be one of the most frustrating games (in regards to ..... how many times can I die??????). Stick with it! Very good!", "Totally awesome, I love the games and the fact that the DLC's are included is doubly amazing! Huge fan of the series. Got just what I ordered and I'm greatly enjoying the game. A better value than I thought. I own both of these games with all the story DLC and some character costumes and whatnot. Bought it on sale. Worth it to play in a crisp 60 FPS (makes aiming and shooting much easier) and it definitely looks better. Great game.  Bought one copy for me and one for my brother to play online with. Awesome games it also includes all the DLC and 75 golden keys. Best game ever played on xbox. It's funny and extremely entertaining! Awesome", "good shootum up hardcore action with outrageus humor Excellent product and seller!", "Okay for an old unit. great Product arrived a day early. As described. And in perfect working order.", "Great Game! Very good game it's really fun 7% Into this game for xbox one.. Instead of Nassau I go to some bizzaro infinity load screen. Some weird loop from which their is no escape. I looked into it and it seems to be common. I am shocked as I have never....in all my years...ever  purchased a game, that just locks up during normal play. This is Assasins Creed. I had heard such good things. I wasted my $20.00. Don't waste yours.", "It works. Works fine but makes weird noise when plugins in excellent! thank you! was as described, quick shipping", "It works great. Haven't had any issues whatsoever. I have played PlayStation 2 in my younger years. It was the best console ever. Sure the graphics kinda suck but it was always the story that intrigued me. I can honestly tell you that I regret selling it for the bombshell of the PlayStation 3. I always played game like star wars Battlefront 2 or jak 3 on it. Sony needed to do a little more to the PS 3. If there was a way to get all my games and data for it back, I would seriously do it. I highly recommend this to any gamers out there who like to stick to the classics!! It came pretty fast 3 days before its supposed arrival and now i can play my old ps2 games defective item", "I loved it so so much I thought this game was alright, I was not impressed with the open world aspect of the game because it was not a true open world situation, it was more of an open section  then you could fast travel to the next sections and so on. You were not able to just wonder around in large areas like skyrim and fallout.The graphics were good but the challenges were not that great. It was extremely easy to solve the puzzles. It seemed like this would be for a younger gamer or someone just starting out.I would not recommend this game to people that are looking for an open world experience or looking for a challenging game. I played through it one time and completed 85% of the game and it still only took maybe 6 to 8 hours, I probably could have finished the game in 4 to 5 hours if I would have just played through and not looked for additional stuff.I will not play this game again, there are no extra\u2019s in the game and once you completed the first go around then there does not seem to be a reason to keep going. I was going to give this a 3 rating but once I wrote down the information I will have to go with a 2 Good Yes the only problem it took some time to receive.........this is a bad ass game......so it was worth the wait beautiful game", "What a mess of glitches and bugs. In terms of graphics they are decent, but even walking around causes the game to twitch and lag. Its a chore just to get from one side of a town to another. Then in battle sometimes the game doesn't load the enemy animations when you hit them at first so they just kind of stand around like they are not sure what's going on. If you can look past all of that you then have the constant fear that the game will crash, and you WILL not get through a play through without it crashing, you just have to hope you don't lose a character and have to start all over (that one happened to me... Thanks lionhead). For some positives the story is ok and the characters are engaging enough to hold your attention. But honestly with all the bugs and fear based anxiety its probably not worth anything more than a boredom induced rental. Fable 2 is the best, wanted this to have for my collection", "They were alright they just started rubbing away after about a month They work great and fit well. I just need to get used to the way they feel. These grips are awful! Do not buy them! I put them on which took a little bit, then any time u push your analog stick all the way in one direction it rubs against the controller!! Without the grip u have a little bit of room so your analog stick will never touch the controller but with it on it always touches the controller! Bad product! The replace the ripped/torn cover and stick on really nice. helps prevent wear of sticks These provide just the additional grip I need to improve my game, just a little tricky getting on but it give you instructions on how to do so The shipping was fast but the product starts to wear out after a while. Over time they fall of the controller more often and they become thinner and the logo begins to fade. On a Xbox one controller it becomes very uncomfortable over time because the crater in the the center of the analog stick sinks in. Have had these for over half a year, first pair still haven't worn out. Really helps with grip, and prevents costly thumbstick wear!This product is a must with PS4 controllers. Love these. I've tried other brands before, but these already feel better and seem more durable. Did a quick run through on Dying Light and I noticed a difference right away. Certainly recommend this product. I bought my PS4 on launch day, and after hearing about people online and 2 friends who had their thumbsticks start to break off I thought I'd try and prevent that by buying a pair of thumbstick covers. Honestly, I'm not pro gamer, and just wanted something that plays nice with a mix of games (Destiny, Bloodborne, etc). I average maybe 1-2hrs on weekdays, and more on weekends. What I've started to notice is that my thumbstick covers have started to kind of deform around my thumbsticks, changing from their initial orientation and becoming kind of lob-sided in shape. I also can tell I'm slowly starting to wear down the actual gecko shaped texture of the grip making them progressively less grippy. I didn't pay much for them, so I can't say several months of use is a bad deal, but don't buy these if you're expecting them to last you a good long while. PROS:-Protects analog stick from infamous analog weardownCONS:-Sweat from your thumbs build up on the covers, so your fingers will frequently slip off-No major ridges means fingers can slip off even more Not only Very difficult to put on but also to remove, thumbs keep slipping off, could not  maintain accuracy after 1 hour of playing with them, took them off an was playing like normal. The grips are 1/16 of an inch too small for ps3 convexted joy sticks One of the few thumbstick covers that actually stay true to the size of the Ps4 thumbsticks I liked them for about a month and then they started falling apart.  The edge of the thumbstick eventually wore through the edge of the cover. Improved grip on Both my Xbox360 controllers (Wired & Wireless) for All games.  Textured surface prevents slipping, even during full-on, boss fight level, Sweaty hands/ digits.  Have used other covers, these are the tightest (takes a min to install, but WORTH it!) Easy to use. Feels good and comfortable on the thumbs.. Doesn't hinder playing experience in any way, and cheap too. They are really great and won't break. They feel natural after a few days of use and are worth buying considering the price.", "It looks beautiful and the concept is great but tracking the monster is an incredibly long and boring process. Playing with bots is also a nightmare. This game is great and a much more enjoyable alternative to Call of Duty or other triple A FPS's. The game idea is original and fun. I don't know if I would pay $60 for it but it was well worth the $20 I picked it up for. This game has an unimaginable amount of DLC that I still have not decided if it's worth it but the base game is worth the discounted price. Uniquely fun. Game came quick and as ordered. Have no complaints about any of that. Game itself was s***, very repetitive and boring. Garbo game , only one game mode, confusing to a beginner and total lack of any story.  Seems fun running around as a monster, but it isnt.Interesting concept, just failed to deliver, waste of my money.", "Excellent game for a 6 year old. As a fan of the original on NES, this really brought me back! Pretty much exactly the same, except for being (obviously) much prettier and the ability to select difficulty. Normal on this game equates to the challenge of the first. Had a blast reliving this game. One thing of note- I figured my young nephew would love it due to the content, but he actually grew tired of it pretty quickly. In part because he's never seen the show but also because he's used to more advanced gameplay. The side-scrolling platfomer just didn't hold his attention. If your a fan of the original then this a must have for the older gamer, especially if you can get it for under $8.", "It's been almost a year now since I've purchased this system and it's still running strong. This item came super quick!Works great! I've owned this ps3 for a couple years now and it still works great! Absolutely no downsides what so ever. I own about 10 games now and love to play them occasionally. I love to also watch blu ray movies on it when I get the chance and they look fantastic. I love this ps3 version better than the slim because it just seems like its better made and will last longer than the slim version. (in my opinion) It's a wonderful Console and I love that I purchased it! I think it will last me a long time.", "thanks Case and outside is good. Game looked good but it freezes up a lot which is annoying. Great game my little brother absolutely loves it! It was everything I expected, good game with tons and tons of things to do. Looked brand-new and worked perfectly. Very good. I only bought it for the dlc which downloads of the disk.", "Just be careful placing on device My favvvvv", "Game was very good ! Works flawlessly Awesome game.", "fun fun fun if you like the hobbit and lego this game is for you easy to play and the best lines from the movie etc and has cool extras to unlock As advertised. Exactly as described!", "Fantastic great", "Was very satisfied with the purchase I got this game at the same time I got Jak 3 and I have to say the look and play great. There were no scratches and played fine, thanks.", "Was a gift. Is loved and was used immediately. Good", "Great Headphones, but be careful because the shipping materials are just the right size to be stuffed in a normal mailbox, and are a pain to get out. My son loves them it broke on the 3rd week and i dont even play that much. Awesome! My son has loved it! No issues or problems and holding up great. Works very good Great works perfect. Great headset. My only issue with the thing is that after only an hour of wear it really irritates the skin around my ears. That may just be me having it on too tight I haven't really tested it out too much yet. Though it seems like it is because of the design of the headset as I have never had this issue with my three previous ones. Other than that though, wonderful headset. Bought these after the first week they came out.  I've had them for plus two years and they are perfect.  For a 60 dollar headset it is hard for it to get old. I got these to replace my PC headset, as it was decent but just kind of a no name one that didn't have many features. I already have an extremely nice (albeit much more expensive) pair of turtle beach's for my 360, so I'm pretty well stuck on this brand now. They are highly rated and widely used for a reason. Compared to other turtle beach headsets, and specifically for use with the PC, they don't stack up (compatibility with PC mainly... they weren't just instantly recognized like most products made for PC. Also, compared to other turtle beach headsets, the comfort and sound quality isn't as good). That's the relative portion of the review I guess. However, I am completely satisfied and I still love these things. Compared to most other brands, they are much better. But you really can only compare higher brand name models with the same brand or others in that category, and I haven't used any other good quality brands... mainly because I'm a turtle beach fan for life since my first set. going on my third set of these, i've learned my lesson not to buy them again.  Cheaply made Very quick shipping, great quality and packaging. Will need adapter for Xbox One. Awesome Great sound quality, love the comfort, comes with 2 cables (USB, and Audio jack) and a mini audio jack on the hand control with the 3 Gears for audio control (Game, Chat, and Bass Boost) although I just use Game volume since that's where I hear everything in general.It just feels polished with a sound card feeding it the audio source.PROBLEM: The side bars of the headset seem to break, lasted me 6 months every time and It's sad I payed for something designed to break at about 6 months of use. the Just wish I had a headset with steel suspension on the side so I wont have to worry about it breaking like these. and when I returned the headphones for a replacement I was charged 14$ on my end so add that to your price list when you buy. I strongly feel that they will break before the year ends if you use them as much as I do and no trolling on my end (NO I'm not stretching them like a child, normal everyday use.) These are truly an awesome pair of gaming headphones. I've had mine for years now and I still use them every time I play, and they're still holding up. If you've never played with gaming headphones before, you're definitely missing out. These allow you to pick up sounds that you would never imagine are going on while using your standard TV speakers. It's also nice to be able to hear both the chat volume with your friends and the game volume from your game being played through the same speaker. You can also control the volume of both very easily, which is nice. The actual mic that you talk into is also very sensitive and you don't have to be speaking loudly at all for everyone to hear you clearly. They fit comfortably on your head and they are relatively durable. The only thing I've noticed with them is that there isn't much noise cancellation coming out of the headphones, meaning that everyone and their mother can hear exactly what you're hearing while they're on your head. I've used these for music recording as well, and this was sort of a problem. Overall though I love this headset. I like it Son is very satisified.  they are still working tho he is hard on earphones the bass is really nice and it has good noise cancellation. It works.", "Easy to install, perfect fit.  Highly recommend! I can use it in long time Works well! Easy to apply and works perfect", "It's a yarn Yoshi, and it's original green. Pretty cute. A bit smaller than expected, but still cool. love it I bought this amiibo for myself since i didn't want to wait and any one who likes yoshi or cute stuff in general this is a great gift to give to anyone Very good condition. Adorable as can be! cute and neatly made I was so pleased to receive my Green Yarn Yoshi Amiibo!!!! He is adorable and very high quality. The yarn Yoshi is my favorite Amiibo so far. I was very happy to discover that the bottom was not plastic and was fabric. I recommend buying this before they are impossible to find! Super cute! I'm really tempted for the bigger one coming soon. It's plushy Love the item and good price but package was damaged Perfect just as described.  Fast Shipping. He is indeed very wooly. The quality is there and I didn't pay that much over the retail price (only 4 or 3 dollars more) Its Yoshi, and he is made out of yarn. You know you want it. Arrived in perfect condition. Very happy. Totally worth paying a little more then retail to save me my time hunting for one and getting months a head of the U.S. Release.", "ok \ud83c\udf89 It Rocks I bought this for my sisters and Nova has turned out to be one of their favorite characters in Marvel Disney Infinity, besides Loki of course. My son  really  enjoy his game.", "My son lost his other charger. This worked perfect. after 2 or so months it just does not work anymore Works great kids are happy now excellent Got everything I ordered on the day it said it would arrive. Note: charger cord is connected to the adapter and can not be removed. We had to buy another charging cable after our cat chewed through our daughters power cord. This works just as good as the original cord and is a lot cheaper than the Nintendo brand charging cable. It does its job by charging your ds, but it is SO short. You can't play your device comfortably because you have to sit next to a plug-in in order to charge it.", "Excellent game experience, funny and good for amateurs and pros alike. Keep you sweating even in the warm up process. I like the game as a hole, but sometimes it's a little too picky about my movements/posture when I'm doing it exactly as asked. Otherwise 5 stars", "Amazing game This game is a lot of fun I love it can't seam to stay off this gameThe Pc version  is better then the ps3 one Love this game! My husband can play it for hours", "Received game and have no problems.  Would order again. Awesome! If you love open world games and zombies then this is the game for you. Truly fun to play for hours and hours. One of the best zombie games I have played, Dying Light brings back the horror in zombie games, a must buy for zombie fans!!! Great game! This game is lit even though I don't play it all the time. My boy and I play this and when it hits night time we out. Game is flames if you have friends, would be cool with some splitscreen but no games have these days sadly. My dad loved it, he literally beat it on regular and hard within 2 weeks. It is a great game and it was just what he wanted for his birthday (:", "Great game.  MUT, draft championship, and connected franchise are fun to play.  Only problem I ever had so far is the EA servers being so slow to log onto.  Sometimes, I'd have to sit there for 10 minutes or more while signing into EA's servers with a lot of restarting.  10/16/15 Update.....  When you exit out of the game, you can go right back in and pick up where you left off.  Well if you turn off your Xbox and come back a day later, you will try to pick up where you left off and find that it just says loading and never logs into the EA servers.  I found that I would have to start another game and eject the Madden disc and log out.  Then put the Madden 16 disk in and let it load.  It would load from the beginning and work right away and the kinect would log me back into my account.  I only have to do this for Madden. My game is not working properly It's the same madden with a updated cover, Bring Back NFL2K Football. The best football game made, which ea sport knew and then brought out the NFL rights so 2k couldn't make NFL2K again. 2k should've did the same thing with basketball because nba live suck hard. Came right on the date it was released! Awesome game. When you can actually play the gamge its great. However every time i want to play something goes wrong with freezing or incrediblely long loading times. My rating may change over time, but for now here's my first impressions....Ratings typically are made by first impressions and as with previous years, I'm finding my first impression with the Madden NFL videogame experience is being ruined by having to sit through forced demos and lessons on what has changed and how I now need to play Madden with the new features.  This of course comes *after* struggling just to get the game to install completely as the first effort at installing got me to a &#34;Ready to Start&#34; that was then met with a &#34;This game needs an update&#34; before I could really start the game.  That took me through a loop of uninstalling the game which hadn't completely installed back through several attempts to get the game to completely install only to be met with &#34;There was an error installing...&#34; that could either have me Retry or Cancel the installation process.When I finally was able to complete the install (patience is definitely key as the process is slow and takes several minutes to get through (more like 15 - 20 minutes total) and actually start the game, I was, as noted, forced to sit through a intro story/movie that gives me a chance to hit a few buttons in key points to complete the play that was automatically called.  There is no way to exit that 'demo' that I could find, so again patience is required to sit back and get ready to actually play the game or enter the code that you might have to get you some additional content.  Once I did complete the opening story, I was then forced into yet more lessons of what has changed in the game or how to play the game, again with no way to exit to the main menu.  Seriously, EA (or their programmers) are that insistent that I have to sit through classes in how to play the game before they'll let me go to the main menu?  You can't offer say a &#34;Learn to play the game&#34; tutorial as a menu choice that would be available (but not forced upon the gamer) at the gamer's choice, rather you have to force the gamers into these tutorials as if they are totally incompetent at just putting the game in and starting to play?As a co-worker and I discussed about this, what happened to the good old days when you could just put the game in and hit the start button?  If the game is really that complex that it requires training and the training is really that different from one year to the next then something is fairly obviously wrong.  Perhaps the developers/publisher need to go back to the drawing board to remove some of the complexity and put back the fun that has been drained away thanks to these experiences.With that all said, I'm sure that fans of the game will love it and will likely trash my comments and call me a H8er.  The game has its fans and it certainly is continuing to be tweaked graphically as it has become one of the more realistic portrayals of athletes in a virtual environment.  It does look really nice, complete with a lot of serious eye candy.  The question is just how frustrated will you be trying to get to the point that you can just play one game?  Once you do get to that point you may find the time you had available to sit and play a quick game has already passed.gamer's choice, rather you have to force the gamers into these tutorials as if they are totally incompetent at just putting the game in and starting to play?As a co-worker and I discussed about this, what happened to the good old days when you could just put the game in and hit the start button?

Once you do get to that point you may find the time you had available to sit and play a quick game has already passed. I love this game,  I haven't played madden in awhile,  but a little of madden 15.  I got this game and it has a great presentation.  I like the new way you get to pick how the receiver catches the ball and how if you pay as the tackle on defense you gotta time the buttons right and you'll get a sack.  I always thought MUT was and awesome contribution to madden,  and I'm sure that the Draft Champions mode is good too.  The franchise mode allows you to gain experience through playing for your team.  It's just a great overall football experience with very few flaws. This game is terrible. I have had it for the 3rd day now and it is truly worthless. The glitches are overwhelming. I have to restart the game almost every single time I try to play a franchise game. It  repeatedly freezes at the end of your game. The player movements are extremely over designed, and only half of the option work regularly. If I could return this, that is the only thing that would make me happy Worst purchase I've made in awhile.  I preordered this through Best Buy and received another Playmaker bundle with 5 MUT packs.  This was in addition to the Playmaker pack and 36 you get form Deluxe.  Opened 2 playmakers and 6 MUT packs on opening night and all I got was a handful of 50s, 60's and 2 Antonio Browns which seem to be the only Playmaker you get in these Playmaker packs.  Seriously... opened 2 playmakers and I get two identical 90 Antonio Browns.  The pack rewards are clearly fixed.Gameplay- Slowed down considerably from Madden 15.  All players feel like they are walking their routes instead of running.  I don't have lag, just the tempo is very slow and feels clunky.Defense is non-existent.  Offense can now throw a Hail Mary on 1st and 10 and with the new &#34;Y' button Aggressive catch, the receiver catches it 85% of the time.  Defense is always 2 steps behind the receiver, so every game I've played in, both myself and opponent finish with 95% completion rates.  Keep in mind this is with my Level 72 MUT team.Overall- A complete waste of money.  I spent 69.99 compared to what I could have had with Amazon's pre order of the Standard edition for $45.00 just for a handful of scrubs and a fixed Playmaker Antonio Brown thats in all Playmaker packs. Armchair quarterbacks rejoice! You now can throw outside shoulder fades and actually complete a pass!The new receiving controls are impressive and give a much needed overhaul to the passing game. Still, EA fails to make simple overhauls Madden fans have been clamoring for the last few years. The in game commentary is the same old song and dance, relocating a team is not as fun as you'd think as they didn't change any name choices and hardly any uniform options from '15, and running the financial side of a team feels hollow and unsatisfying. The new scouting system is fresh but at the same time does not really help you effectively identify the best players in a draft class.The in game experience is fun, though defensively it doesn't really feel like you have any control over the game. Running the ball is great, speedy backs feel quick and hard to catch, power backs bust through tackles regularly, and you don't get tripped up/tackled by your own linemen.If you're looking for a fun in game experience, Madden 16 is great. If you're expecting Madden 16 to finally deliver fans from the stagnation that has plagued this series for the last few years, you will be disappointed. It's the same old Madden with a couple of new tricks and a new coat of paint. Requires no effort at all. If you throw a deep route and hold down Y, there's a 70% chance you'll catch it. Worst madden game of all time. It's awesome!!! Fresh and clean look. I love this game", "My old one was having some serious issues. This one works great. Was Dead On Arrival, should have been tested before being sent out. The internal fan is a little big loud, but  the gen AC gets the job done.  PRICE was right, so can't complain too much . It will get you drunk!!!!!  Drunk on gaming that is.  Works great until it breaks! Great Second one of these we've bought and it only lasted just over 30 days, it got so hot on its own that it melted the bottom and blew out the side. These are low quality and junk. From the packaging you can tell these were made in China as there are multiple spelling and grammar errors. Better off just buying an actual Xbox power supply rather than this knock off.   EDIT: We ended up using this  broken one a little while longer while we waited for a new one to come in. It blew a capacitor inside and fried our 360. Don't buy these unless you want to in the end buy a new 360. Which by the way Amazon won't make right by replacing our 360  that this product broke. Great alternative for the official plug. Blew out as soon as I used it. It arrived earlier than it originally had planned. Which is awesome since someone had tried to steal my sons Xbox. We got it back but they kept The cords. But it worked great.", "AMAZING. love it I bought this game to play with my eight year old grandson.  We have an XBox 360 as well as a Wii U, and I chose the Wii U version so we don't have to play split screen, which I find really annoying.I've played many other Lego video games, and this one works pretty much the same as the others.  The only unique aspect is that you can play as a dinosaur.  There also seems to be a lot more running around looking for things and less fighting with other characters than in the other Lego games (although you do have to knock out some pesky dinosaurs at times).  I found it kind of confusing figuring out how to get to all the parks, but that could just be me.My main complaint is the amount of bugs in this game, which really should have been taken care of before it was released. It completely froze several times during play.  Sometimes when you are playing a one player game, the other character just randomly changes on his own to another character or a dinosaur.  I was playing as T Rex when he got stuck inside a wall.  I found trying to make Billy Brennan glide to be very frustrating  Sometimes he would just not open his parachute, even though I was controlling him correctly.  Velociraptor can jump and pull bars, but you have to stand in just the right place to make this work, which can take a long time to find.Another quirk is that in many places you need to be a dinosaur to accomplish certain actions.  In Free Play mode, if you're standing too close to where you need to change to a dinosaur, you cannot switch to the dinosaur character.  You need to move some distance away.  Why?This is my least favorite Lego video game.  I would recommend waiting until the price drops to about $19.99 before buying, which shouldn't take too long.  Maybe they will fix some of the bugs by then. Great quality", "Very good ! Probably the smoothest playing FPS game out there. The MMO elements are slightly questionable when it comes to how the game handles level progression. However, the big expansion pack comes out this month and I assume that many of those issues will be addressed.Please note: this game essentially requires the expansion packs for a full experience. Tried this game because it was free with my PS4 bundle.  Got bored with it after a few hours.  The story doesn't really go anywhere.  Just repetitive battle arenas, and multiplayer with annoying 12 year olds.  I have a feeling the new Star Wars Battlefront 3 will be just like this.  Boring.I'm waiting for a good FPS game to come out, like DOOM. Hands down one of the best Segway games from the COD franchise. It brought back the fun of playing with other people that has been slipping away for years now. One star, because there's no story, no good game play, lack of things to do, the grind is on an insane level. Bungie has no idea on how to make a MMO. Plus 500 million dollar budget on this poor quality game. Its not even fun when you're playing with other people. The only good thing about the game is the music and visuals. I did not find this fun because I had experience playing other MMOs. I think a lot of people enjoy this game because its their first MMO, and they don't have anything to compare Destiny to other relate able MMO games. That's completely understandable and hey if you have fun then that's cool.I recommend this game to people who never played a MMO, who don't care about story, or a serious bungie fan. But if you're like me that craves a good story in games and have experience playing MMOs then this game is not for you. Great game.  Transferred all my characters very without a problem.  Shipped fast Destiny is a shell of what was previewed at E3. The disk contains minimal content and twhat little story they have doesn't even make sense.I was a huge Borderlands 2 fan and was hoping for something similar. This is not it.Worse yet, every DLC released so far have also included minimal content.I would not waste my time, especially with some really amazing games coming out soon (Halo 5, Fallout 4, Star Wars Battlefront). At this point the game is heavily discounted so they can sell overpriced DLC.I was duped. You don't have to be. This game NEEDS the dlc to play it. Terrible story. Good gunplay. Overall crappy quality game. okay. Straight to the point:Not everyone is going to like this game.I however, have put 1250 hours into this game, it is so addicting. The reward system is set up to give you completely random rewards and for most content you aren't guaranteed anything. If you get this you will be hunting down a particular weapon for hundreds of hours. If you don't like the sound of that, it's not for you.As of right now the story is completely absent from destiny. This may change with the new expansion: The Taken King. It looks promising and if you're just getting destiny it is a great deal. The original game plus 2 dlc's ($20 a piece) plus the Taken King expansion for $60.Despite its current lack of story, the competitive multiplayer is amazing. In no other first person shooter do you get the visual feedback on your screen like in destiny. It shows how much health an opponent has left and is all around great fun. Weapon balancing is an issue right now for the competitive multiplayer, as only a few top tier &#34;exotic&#34; weapons rule this game mode. However they are releasing a patch soon to rebalance the weapons (something they do every few months) and I hope it'll bring other weapons up to par.All in all, I have loved every second of this game. I don't know how long I will play it, but I'm not stopping anytime soon.Onto The Taken King, guardians My son loves this game One of the best FPS mechanics of any game so far, but MMO elements may deter long time FPS fans.  Personally I can't get enough of this game, it's addicting.  Matchmaking is not provided for much of the end game content so you have to seek it out on other sites such as Reddit, LFG and the100.io among others.  Unfortunately this is the best content in the game and you'll only get real value out of the game if you play the end-game content such as Raids, Strikes, etc.  Expansion packs are a must.  The only way to keep playing is to continue to buy DLC.  At this point in time The Taken King is about to be release so if you're looking to get into this game grab the Legendary edition so you have the base content and all 3 expansions. My kids love it Purchased as a gift! Bungie is greedy. Get Black Ops 3 instead if you want a great shooter. Very nice video game !!", "kindly like a must have if you own a wii My wife and I play and use this tape almost daily.  Fun!!!", "Great. This remote is perfect for little kids to play the Wii with. My kids love using it over the regular Wii controller as it fits better in there little hands. I have had it for a few months with no issues and it was easy to sync up.", "More of a movie than a game. It's also weird how the camera angle is behind and to the side of the character on screen while you are playing. Graphics are pretty but I don't think I would buy it if I played it before purchasing. Excelent video game, experience maxim Ok, so I'm going to go and make a guess here why some of the mainstream media sites gave The Order average to bad reviews. Price. At $60, gamers today expect to be entertained for 200+hours, especially in the shooting genre. You need to have multiplayer, new game plus bonuses, harder and harder difficulties, etc...and this is likely just too barebones of a game for today's new generation of gamers. For me, I don't have time to sit down with 10-15 games for over 100 hours. Those games I sit down with that long are thoughtfully chosen, and few and far between. For me, I agree that The Order is too short, but I still rate it very highly. The game is not bad, it simply may not be the value proposition at $60. For you, maybe it's $40, or $30, but to say the game is terrible, well, I feel it's extremely disingenuous to the devs at Ready at Dawn.Pros- Well crafted and acted Story, that continually gets more interesting- Beautiful aesthetics and atmosphere, playing around with the photo mode and colors themes really highlight how beautiful the game is- No hud or menus really add to the story progression and gets you engrossed in the game. I put headphones on and had a really really great 3 hours session. Was completely engulfed in the story after the mid way point.- Really fun, visually pleasing weapons, that honestly, I wanted to play more of- There simply isn't enough mechanics in the game. Linear story-telling is perfectly fine for what they are trying to accomplish here. But a basic progression system, more back story, collectibles, etc...would have broadened the game's appeal.Cons- You can tell this is the team's first step into the big AAA title space. The Order is really basic and simple. Sometimes, that simplicity is absolutely beautiful, but sometimes it leaves much to be desired.-Pacing could be better as well as more gameplay variety-This gameplay engine is just begging for multi-player modes, horde modes, and other co-op experiences. Really, there's a lot more Ready at Dawn could have done with this engine, it seems kinda rushed out the door. The SP was well done, but it is a very barebones games, that at times, have to count as somewhat negative.At $20 and $30, it's really hard to knock The Order though. It's still one of if not the most visually stunning PS4 games on the market, and at times I felt like I was playing Gears of War on Playstation lol. Not sure we'll ever get a sequel, but this one is full of potential. Go and play it now if you like playing through a solid story and third person shooting.ay engine is just begging for multi-player modes, horde modes, and other co-op experiences.

Which is ok.  I love games with good stories.  It's just that this game is very linear and doesn't let you explore or interact with the environment as much as you'd like to.  It's just step by step, go here, do this, next level... super fun. didn't get enough credit from IGN and the gaming industry. I really enjoyed it and I'm pretty particular on video games", "Good headset Great headphones for xbox and for pc. Quality is about as great as a pair of turtle beaches but cheaper. Bought as a gift. Recipient likes them. My son has had no problem with these Not the best headset but decent for the price. Good stereo sound for games. Only problem is the mic. Friends on live can tell when I use it because of the mic. They say it sounds muffled when compared to my other headset (Polk 4 shot with boom mic). Very nice headset. Good quality sound. Very impressive. Better than expected, I own a ps4 headset, so when I saw this one I though it would have bad sound, but it really is good, much more imersive to play the games with them than using the TV speakers I agree with most reviews on here as this headset is the &#34;Casual&#34; gaming headset. It's definitely comfortable around the ear with great sound quality. In the beginning you'll have to do a controller update which updates the controller sync correctly with the adapter that comes with this.The buttons are super easy to control for game/chat volume and mute/unmute buttons.If you want something even better, you can grab the Astro A50's. Good (not great) quality sound but the mic appears to be too sensitive... other gamer complain that they can hear the sound from my headphone coming through my mic. I had previously bought the Xbox One Stereo Adapter to use headphones, but I wanted a headset with a built-in microphone so that I could chat while playing. The microphone on this headset seems fine, and the fit was decent (still a little tight for my large head), but the audio quality was much lower than other headphone sets I've used. Even the headphones that came with my iPhone had better audio than this headset. The sound was very boomy and bass-heavy, to the point where I felt like I was listening to my game through a closed door. I could hear what was going on, but it felt much less crisp and more detached from the game. It felt like I was playing with a head cold.", "No issues! It's everything that i expected. Fair price Great earphones. I bought the wrong pair but they work for the Xbox One. They produce a crisp clear sound, and seem to work for hours on end. Can't say much for speech as that did not work for the Xbox One. They work excellent however, audio and speech, on the PC for gaming too! All ok Very sensibility audio, for example playing with call of duty is possible to listen steps of the enemies. Good price Amazon Headphones They are great but one of the ear peaces broke off i was able to super glue it back on but they are great besides that Terrible quality.  These lasted a couple months and the headband broke as I was putting them on one day.  They just snapped as I was stretching them apart to go over my ears. broke after less than 6 weeks.  the left side plastic arm snapped in two putting them on yesterday.  otherwise pretty nice headset but if you can't wear it, it's useless. I just received these yesterday and I totally love them they're comfortable and very light. They are easy to use but the instructions could be updated a little but they are the real deal I love te in game audio it's helped me out a lot in first person shooters. This headset was worth the money :) Headset lasted me about 8 months before the adjustment slides broke. I had heard that they were made pretty cheap so I basically treated this thing like it was my baby. It still ended up breaking anyway. Sound is great, but not worth the cheap build. Save your money for something better. i love these things. only thing is it hurts the top of my head for some reason after long hours of gaming lol but maybe im still breaking them in. its so great to be completely wireless though    UPDATE: 8 /3 / 2016. after having these for about a year, like i read some reveiws, THEY BREAK EASY. What happened, i took such great care of these things. And the left side just snapped as i go to put it on my head gently.. No force. I took great care of these things, cause I read the reviews of them snapping.. and here they snap after like a year. And I loved these head phones... sad day. I love this headset, I use it for my ps4, at first I was a little confused about how it's connected and having to connect it in the back to the optical port, but once I got it all figured out, I was amazing at the quality of the surround sound, it's great, I love how you have 2 different sound buttons, one for the party and one for the game sound. My favorite part is that it's noise cancelling, I can barely hear anything besides what's going through the headset, and I like that a lot.", "Fast shipping, great game and purchase. This is my favorite game in the Zelda series. It's even better on the 3DS. Great product, but shipping with I-Parcel was a nightmare. Not the best Zelda game, though counted among the best for sure. This port increases the frame rate, addresses gameplay problems from the N64 version, and updates graphics and textures for a fantastic game. This is worth buying the 3DS for. The adventures in this game are just awesome... great game, awesome graphics Great game I never fully got the chance to play Majora's Mask on the N64, so this was a great experience for me. As a long time Zelda fan, bringing games like &#34;Ocarina of Time&#34; to handhelds instead of remaking them on the Wii U, was frightening. I thought it would take the quality of the game away, but I was wrong... It brought a new light to the game, It LOOKS GREAT IN 3D absolutely amazing! And the graphics are basically just like the old N64 ones but sharper, so it's not like you're playing a COMPLETELY different game. Recommend it for Zelda Fanatics.", "The product arrived on time. It was exactly what I expected and there was no damage during shipment. Really happy with my package! Came just as described.  My kid loves the game and the console is cool too.  You can play your DVD's on this as well. Box was crashed. Top of game console was also cracked. It is working ok, but very disappointed. It was a present for my son. Great bundle. Great system. everything as expected. Just love it amazing! My son loves the PS4. However I was less impressed with the actual contents of the box. Why sell this fabulous piece of equipment and only include ONE controller in the box? First day of using it and I am off to a local store to buy a second controller so he can play games with his friends. $414 for a system that keeps shutting off, utterly frustrating. Wanted to play mgs5 bad, and now i have to send this machine back. This is sony's 4th console and you would think they would have smoothed over all these bugs bye now. The ps4 came fine but i thik that is not new becuase it not came with the ps plus conde and the box was a little broken and the shipping was horrible Came just as described! Amazing Got this on time and arkham knight is an amazing game. A must buy if you can afford it Did not come with console's stand or power cable. Great game and great console. Could've used more packaging though. I'm surprised it didn't break while bring shipped. Bought this for my son. He loves it. I love my PS4. Call me a fanboy, but they really refined the UI for the system. And hell... Batman added in to the normal price? No complaints from me. Awesome! The interface is so much smoother than xbox's very happy with it. Games not bad either. Exelent I've been an XBOX man since they came out but my brother talked me into the PS4. I have no regrets. It's an impressive piece of equipment. It's also nice just pausing your game and putting it in sleep mode and picking up where you left off the next day. No turning it on and waiting for it to warm up or load the last save, you just pick right up where you left off. Very cool. Great buy Very good shipping. The only thing I have to say box was mestup one side other then that everything was in no damage. The shipping 5 star the rest 4 stars Please, is the best console ever Excelent game Awesome. Everything as ordered i was disapointed with the performance of this PS4 Excellent shipping, brand new, would buy again! Awesome", "GREAT GAME! amaaazing", "you have to take off the motion plus to charge. We already lost one motion plus doing this on/off. This works great but be aware the blue light is extremely bright so we usually keep a cloth over it so it doesn't interfere with watching TV. One battery doesn't work. Charging contacts are very sensitive.", "Works well with controllers. Keeps them charged easily Works wonderfully.  The battery even fits well enough to work and charge in the older version remotes that don't have a built-in motion plus.  That was a life saver when my new remote with the built-in motion plus broke after only a month. It just can't keep a charge.Pros: Looks CoolCons: Looks cool while not working. Great product and services! I don't have to worry about batteries anymore. Not having the kids waste handfuls of batteries a week makes this product worth it in and of it self. If you plug the usb into the wii unit it will only charge controllers while the unit is on. Wish they included a wall adapter. If you have the wrist strap on the controller it takes a little wiggling to get it to sit right to charge. over all these are minor things. I gave it 1 star because out of the 2 battery packs, 1 still works. Both were really snug fitting onto my wii remotes. One works so far. The other broke before I got to use it. The one that broke, the metal piece that makes the contact snapped off. Disintegrated really. It was really soft metal and broke the first time I tried to install it into my remote. If you look at the photo, the one on the left is the one that fell apart. The one on the right is still intact and seems to hold a charge alright. However, I did just start using it on a regular basis. I never got to use the one on the right at all. I'm going back to rechargeable batteries in the wii remotes after this. The USB cord is really short as other reviews have mentioned but it fits perfectly in the console of my couch that has a USB port. I had high hopes that this was exactly what I was looking for. However, its only good if you want to use one remote. What better way to beat your friends at Mario Kart than for them to have a remote that doesn't work at all!", "The graphics on 360 are horrible. I can't read any thing and it makes the game play difficult. Gameplay good, but the graphics are way lower quality than what I expected Good Game better off buying for Xbox One a lot of lag you will need harddrive to play this", "It was amazing. Everything came as promise. Awesome came with games exceeded expectations!", "Awesome kaos is trapped Capture Kaos? You bet! The Skylanders games are really fun! We love them. son hasn't quit using Excellent Very happy Great delivery time, my kids were excited. Great", "Very nice product. Came with an extra decal for free! Extra points for the provider! Very easy to place on the controller and seems to be long lasting since I've had no issues of it peeling off since the purchase of this product. 5*/5* Great for all the batman fans out there. Really made my Arkahm Knight gaming experience that much better. Coolest thing ever if you love batman !!", "I bought the &quot;Original&quot; Dishonored on the street date sometime in October a few years backI loved the 360 version I put at least 35hrs. into it  (Not counting the DLC)But, the truth be told the game looked horribleDishonored should've never ever been put on last Gen Hardware (PS3 &amp; XB360) The game was not built for hardware that oldArkane Studios and Bethesda should've just put it out for the PC master race 'Cause God knows they deserve everything as far as gaming goes!But, they didn't they lied to a massive consumer base and put out a super unpolished game and sold it for a low low asking price of $60.00 USI payed 60.00 for my 360 version on day onedid i truly get what i payed for honestly No even though I loved the gameWhen I heard they were putting out a re-mastered Definitive edition of DishonoredI was all in on one condition price the $40.00 SRP is worth every pennyI pre-ordered it as soon as I could cause unlike all the phony trollsI had faith console gamer's would get the proper version of Dishonored we never gotMy copy arrived last Tues (Thanks to Amazon Prime) But, haven't had time to play ituntil Sat night I pop it in put 3.5 hrs intoand I truly forgot what a amazing game Dishonored is (It's on Par with the Likes of BioShock in being a massive living breathing world like nothing your ever see before)On to the elephant in the roomIs this a true remastered version compared to the 360 version it's night and dayThe clown who said it's a port don't understand what port means State of Decade (360) to State of Decade (XOne) was a bloody portThis is far from a port and all the so-called PC gamer's why would you be playing a XOne game???This review is for console gamer's not insecure little boys who have to spend $2,500.00 on a gaming PC to brag about that very rig to total strangers about what there PC can do they don't brag about there car or the chick they are banging but, a bloody box that plays video games seriously..........This is by no means a waste of money of all the cheap money grab over the last year or so with re-releases of titles this is one more gamer's should be on board with not fighting over it not being 4k resolution! Jesus this is a hobby (btw who can really afford 4k equipment?)If you wanna add a strong title to your XOne library this is the one to do itThe game will never look so good on home consoles (unless you have money to burn on a super expensive high end PC)this is the way to go!I beat the 360 version of it clocked in 40hrs including the dlc (so you can get plenty of hours out of this title)Audio:The sound to is also much better if you have a good home theater set-up you'll get DTS Sound (DTS is the best way to experience sound but, I'm just a huge fan of  the DTS Audio format)The V/O Cast is just crazy GoodSusan Sarandon as (Granny Rags)Lena Headey  as (Callista Curnow )Brad Dourif  as (Piero Joplin)Michael Madsen  (Daud)John Slattery  (Admiral Havelock)Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz  (Lady Emily Kaldwin) This is her Pre massive Star she is Not returning to Dishonored IIBilly Lush  (The Outsider)Carrie Fisher  (she did alternative v/o work I honestly missed her v/o work)This is a great example of using legit Hollywood Actors doing v/o work for the game!everyone is so damn goodThe biggest minus is the character you play Corvo never speaks and doesn't have a speaking voice!I forgot about that till i played this versionThe Controlsthese are a mixed bag i only say that cause on the xbox one they are just as good as the previous 360 controllerIt takes some getting used to the handling isn't nearly as good as Bio Shock (You can do as much but, you don't feel as though you can pull it off as easy!)

I picked this game up because I did play a portion of it years ago and wanted to play the whole thing one my XB1. It was a very good game until it started freezing at the Kaldrin Bridge every time. I tried to load different saves and a number of other things. There is nothing I can do to fix the freezing. I'm so disappointed. What a waste. Let's hope MGS5 this Tuesday proves to be an awesome game. The game is basically the old game re-sold for xbox one. It's actually not a bad game but loading times are so ridiculously long that the experience is pathetic.. no effort was made on that front.I'm talking about 50+ seconds to reload everything each time you die... or want to try something different... or travel... Great game and a great buy TL;DR: Best for people who have never played Dishonored before. Great for last-gen owners of the game who miss the game or have never played the DLC before. Worst for people who have played the PC version or have owned all the DLC on last gen systems.Dishonored is worth your every penny... if you had bought it years ago 2012. It was a fantastic game at the time, and even now, it still is. However, for a game that came out 2012, it runs on the Xbox One of 2015 (I have no experience with the PS4 version, though I suspect it runs identically) as if it were still on the Xbox 360. Long load times, 30 FPS or less, and only *slightly* crisper graphics. This is clearly no Remastered edition. Closer to a well-done port. The Definitive edition is a sort of balance between the X360 release and the much superior PC version. Simply put, the Definitive edition is a bit of a technical disappointment.Okay, so I've made the game sound terrible to some people. It isn't. Dishonored itself was wonderfully polished, fun, and filled with lots of political intrigue. It would take a while to sum up all the good points of the game and bundled DLC. And believe me, the positives DEFINITELY outweigh the negatives. Newcomers will NOT be disappointed. Returning players will be pleasantly replaying a great game. But veterans will be playing pretty much the same game they've already played. Nothing seems improved from the 360 version. The game, however, is still one of the greatest experiences from the last generation. It comes with the 3 DLCs included and it an absolute blast to play through again. another reviewer stated that it's only 30fps but I bet it's like 50 on ps4 sonce ps4 has more horsepower r. Disappointing, that's the best way to describe this &#34;definitive&#34; version of a last gen classic. This game represents some of the worst that the recent remaster trend has to offer. Unlike most remasters the definitive edition does not seem to increase performance in any notable way, with the game running at 1080p (I think lol its hard to tell with the awful textures) and a sub 30 frame rate. Let me be clear, I like this game, and the definitive edition doesn't really hurt the game, but it doesn't make it any better. As such people who have already played the game on the last gen consoles don't really have a good reason to pick this up, aside from this game's other main selling point which is that it includes all of the dlc for the main game. For a limited time people who owned the original version of the game actually get the definitive edition for $20 as opposed to it's regular $40 selling price. For that price this supposed remaster may be worth it for the dlc assuming you haven't already played them.", "Great fit, great feel.  Nice to still see the 3DS XL color underneath while still keeping it protected. It fits exactly with my 3ds Bought for wrong game system Fits great and makes me feel more secure while holding my 3ds xl! Fits perfectly", "I decided to purchase a backup controller as soon as the R2 button broke on my original.  Now, as far as the &#34;feel&#34; of a controller in my hands, this is hands down, the VERY best of them all!  The feel, the look, the touch screen on top.  Everything works perfectly to give you that great gaming experience.  However, when it comes to the components that make up the insides of the controller?!  Well, that's a completely different thing.  The trigger buttons are plastic and when you get to shooting those bad guys, well, the plastic tends to tear apart.  This happened to me while playing [[ASIN:B00SHXKC8M Borderlands: The Handsome Collection - Playstation 4]].  I played through the original Borderlands, the 2nd, and even the 3rd (prequel) on my Xbox 360, MULTIPLE times, without having a problem.  However, only a few hours into this game, the trigger pin shattered, leaving me without a gun in the middle of Pandora?!Apparently, this is a rather common problem as you'll find countless videos about it on Youtube.  Do yourself a favor and go purchase R2 & L2 replacement buttons from eBay.  That way if you do find yourself with a broken controller, you can fix it right up.  And it is rather easy to fix.  So that's definitely a good thing! excellent, original bought direct from amazon Just as expected NOTICE: I use this controller on PC with a program called &#34;InputMapper&#34;.I've used all sorts of controllers, ranging from emulated GameCube gamepads all the way to the XBOX One controller, but the form and function of the PS4 controller is impossible to beat. The trackpad also doubles as a mouse which is amazing. The feel of the PS4 controller is also amazing as it is light, sturdy, and the buttons and triggers actuate very smoothly.Best controller for the money on the market today. This product is very nice and the service too. Work ok so far The PS4 controllers are comfortable, and the touch pad is a fun new feature but... Battery life is terrible, I don't think the light bars help much with this, light brighness settings can be adjusted though. The thumb-sticks are also pretty bad, the rubber grip coating will tear or wear away before too long. I got a used one and it is in perfect condition felt as if it was brand new. The rubber on the analogs are in mint condition. The touchpad is in perfect form as if it was replaced with a new one. Also the triggers are perfect and not worn out from extensive play time. The buttons are perfect as well. Nothing missing nothing loose not 3rd party. No gloss from the previous owner skin oil so it comes in the matte black  as if you were buying a new one from a retailer. I am very happy spending 40 dollars or less. Better then going to gaystop and spending almost 60 dollars on a new one. Very comfortable controller. excellent excellent Came exactly how it was described and in a timely fashion.", "best game for the family fun, definitely improves on all the previous Mario karts but does not do anything completely different. wonderful game hours of enjoyment It worked for three months then one day it quit. Now it's garbage. As described", "This is an absolute hot mess.  EA has become infatuated with selling virtual football cards for hundreds of dollars and gimmicky drafts with dead  and retired football players on Ultimate Teams, and in the process has destroyed the core game.CFM mode fantasy draft is virtually useless.  You are unable to sort by categories and higher overall rated players are rated less than the mysterious rating placed upon players by EA.  This is worse than the so called perfect players.  I am a JJ Watt fan but 99 in all categories? This is getting ridiculous.  They've changed things that didn't need changing.  Some VP at EA must've had their 12 year old nephew rate the players.They are so enamored with one handed catches by receivers that the rest of the game doesn't work.Case in point.Just played game with Eli Manning after CFM fantasy draft.  On 2nd and three Manning throws a 27 yard pass to Avant who catches and runs for 8 more yards.  After great fanfare by Sims and company, the game cycles to the next play and its mysteriously 3rd and ten and the announcers are talking about how terrible the offense has been playing.Later in the fourth quarter my DB intercepts a pass on the 1 yard line.  Next play Manning takes the snap to throw from the end zone.  The line holds, no one in the backfield.  The play freezes and it says its a safety, and wants me to punt.  Manning is standing there holding the ball.Continually you select a play and when you go to choose a hot route, not only does the art disappear.  But the play that starts is not one you've selected, and its not even in your list of audibles.  The tight ends disappear.  This is the worst Madden ever.This  list  of wierdness could go on forever.  Don't buy it.  Go back to Madden 15 until they fix it.. Maybe 2 years from now.  These are not small glitches.  These are major problems.  It is totally unplayable.EA thinks that eye candyand one handed catches can distract you enough to realize that you can't even play the game. Before you buy this, Google Madden 16 Freeze and you can see the widespread problem this game has; it freezes at the loading screen after every franchise game.Additionally, the rag doll physics are just awkward.  I mean really awkward.A step backward in what was a very hyped game.  What additions there are are overshadowed by the freezing and glitches. My reviews are mainly focused on core gameplay mechanics, so that'll be my focus here.  For the longest time, I've been saying that Madden needs a definitive turnkey/pivotal title that'll be the true platform to continuously build the game up from.  Madden 16 to me is definitely that benchmark title as the feel of football is true and completely undeniable regarding what's going on here for sure.  Let me get into this a bit deeper.WR/DB Interactions: Out the box, you had a good number of people on the EA access 10 hour trial screaming out how catching was OP (overpowered), and were getting caught over end over end on deep balls in 1 v 1 situations mainly.  That's just the issue there though, people needed to learn how to use the new in game mechanics.  The days of just pressing Y or Triangle are gone.  You must learn to press A or X and play the receiver, spotlight the receiver if your secondary isn't great, assign the extra man or adjust your playcalling to have that safety over top to defend those situations just like they do IN REAL LIFE!!  There's only a few DBs/Safeties in the league that are great 1 on 1 defenders, and even they get additional support as they'll get beat too (ex: Patrick Peterson vs Amari Cooper is a great example of this).  If there were anything I'd say was an issue with this, it would be the frequency of one handed catches that would need to be toned down a bit.  Otherwise, I strongly suggest people get in the skills trainer and practice field and learn how to effectively use the mechanics instead of making the blind complaints because you're not winning like you were used to back then.  Times are changing for real now!!!QB Pass Placement/Inaccuracies/AI: In Madden 15 the pass innacuracies were introduced, but due to community complaints, it was toned down and the &#34;Robo QB&#34; was back in full effect.  This year it's back and not going anywhere.  In addition to dedicated pass placement mechanics, you have the most control since the PS2 days when it comes to how you want to deliver the ball, high over the shoulder lobs, mid-level passes that'll sail over LBs and in that hole within the zone where only the receiver can get it, or throwing it low and away so the risk of a pick on that curl or comeback route is reduced to nil and would only be a drop or a breakup by defender contact.  Now you can clearly see the CPU AI difference between Geno Smith and Tom Brady when it comes to how they are at making reads, accuracy on throws, and how they also deal with defensive pressure when the pocket collapses.Run Game/Trenches: Regarding the running game this year, the controlled player movement is greatly improved, as the ballcarrier feels much more weighed down and attached to the field.  Especially when it comes to making quick cuts, and bursting through holes, even when utilizing skill moves too, the footwork is highly noticeable and the player movement is the best out of ANY football game out in my opinion.  When it comes to the run game and reading blocks, you MUST BE PATIENT!!  You have to allow the blocks to develop and make the proper reads instead of mashing turbo and getting stuffed prematurely.  Speaking on the Trenches the O-Line/D-Line battling is much more balanced and the sack totals aren't nearly where they were in the history of the franchise.  Now it's more of a progressive win/loss battle to get into the backfield, unless you have a beast like JJ Watt/Gerald McCoy/Ndamukong Suh on the line you're controlling.  Even with that in place, with the CPU QB AI, they don't hold the ball nearly as much as they used to and will already have made their read and threw the ball, or will try to buy time by moving in or rolling out the pocket and throwing the ball away.Penalties: The final part to discuss here are the penalties, they're FINALLY back and count more than a way of impacting how gameplay outcomes are potentially determined like in years past.  Now the sliders determine the frequency of what penalties get called.  What I like even more is that when the penalties are called, there are clear animations to show what had happened onfield.  Whether it's a holding, PI, facemask or an illegal block in the back, they all have a visual depiction to go along with what penalty took place.  They still are lacking every penalty legible for the game at this point, and also a challenge system a la NFL 2K5 where I can choose what I want to challenge regardless of what took place on the field instead of the game dictating what can or can't be challenged.  Once again, this is a legit foundation to build upward from.In closing, these gameplay refinements make this the most realistic playing Madden title to date, and these past 3 games (Madden 13 - 15) were the building blocks that helped 16 set itself up to truly be great going forward.  With some tuning/patching within these core gameplay aspects.  Madden 16 can be a truly official title to set the tone of true football authenticity and replication for the future of this franchise. It's Madden...some improvements, including my favorite...you can search auctions in your item binder, so you don't have to exit out to see what a player is going for on auctions before listing.  That alone was a big bonus this year for me.  Other than that, some of the catching features make it easier to catch the ball...almost too easy.  Seems like the MUT packs are better than last year right from launch...you should be able to build a decent team just through initial loyalty packs and pre-orders.  Overall, I'm not disappointed...haven't tried the draft game yet, that seems like it might be fun. This game is a clear winner and can't wait to see what is going to happen to this game next year! I am impressed EA great job plays and feels so nice and smooth! Online lag can improve but it's definetly playable nice! I haven't had lag online it  was fine! :) check your internet people I have 100mbs! Best Madden ever!!  Buy it NOW!!!  Free Brady!!!  Patriots will repeat this year!!!! Great game love it thanks for being on time had no problems Amazon is great Good game. Game was delivered on time but game is awful, riddled with errors, and is 98% the same game it's been the past few years. Runs slow, glitches, had to restart ps4 mutiple times just to get to a menu where I could play a game. Like other reviews say, i have to restart game after each franchise mode game. 10 times in a row so far. EA must truly not give a damn to pit out an awful product like this. Madden buyer since 98. Never missed a year, but this will be my last, you'd be smart to avoid this one. Sick of each monopolizing nfl the game will always be a glitch buggy all offence based pos. Now even worse wit the over powered aggressive catch when u can use the same play to always get a reception. I don't need to say more I know plenty of people will write paragraphs on how auful madden is I'm done I want a different company to produce Nfl so done with ea - PS4 Review-Not sure what all the complaining is about\u2026 I almost didn\u2019t buy Madden this year because of all the lackluster and negative feedback. Glad I ignored it... Is it leaps and bounds over last year\u2019s Madden? No. But, in my opinion, Madden 15 was a pretty solid game. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve had any of the freezing or bugs others have seen in this version\u2013 and even if there are those issues, new updates will fix them\u2026 I didn\u2019t notice any excess loading times like other reviewers suggested.Enhancements & Updates:-Obviously, like every year, updated rosters including 2 new high profile starting rookie QBs this year-New extra point rule being farther out-Better passing, including a \u2018touch pass\u2019 that gets it over the LBs, but under the safeties. Also, a \u2018low to the ground pass\u2019 and a \u2018shoulder pass\u2019. Yeah, you could \u2018kind of\u2019 do it in last year\u2019s edition (not the touch pass over the middle so much), but it feels better this year\u2019s update.-No huddle situations aren\u2019t as \u2018rushed\u2019 for the defense where you\u2019re on the brink of off-sides every time - like it was last year-Better catching options: \u2018Catch and Run\u2019, \u2018Catch and Go Down\u2019 which helps in traffic, and \u2018Aggressive / Acrobatic Catch\u2019 (which by the way has excellent animations whether you catch the ball or not). I thought this sounded like a useless gimmick at first, but after playing it, I like it.-Enhanced after play animations: you don\u2019t have players flopping around and falling down like idiots after the play like in last year\u2019s edition. Also, more realistic look in the way players are tackled and piled on top of each other in gang tackles.-Player / Coaches faces and bodies look more realistic-More realistic sideline personnel with ball-boys and extra camera crew as well as better camera anglesNeeds Improvement:-Players on the sidelines without names on their jerseys?-I make a field goal and no one in the crowd stands up to cheer \u2013 especially when I go up by 10 with under 2 minutes to go?-Commentary, well, still is pretty boring.-Occasional pixilation here and there \u2013 mostly on after play cut-scenesOverall:Is it worth it for me? Yeah. It\u2019s like the price of a nice meal out for 2 people\u2026 I\u2019d prefer to have Madden 16 (over Madden 15) for a full year instead of a few drinks, wings, and an 8 oz sirloin steak at a restaurant for 1 night... But maybe that\u2019s just me\u2026 Glad I didn't buy.  I agree that most of the good reviews are fake. Madden 16 delivers the best console football experience in the past 10 years. Casual and hardcore fans alike will both like the highly addictive Draft Champions mode. Connected Franchise got some much needed polish and the regression and XP issues that plagued the mode last year appear to have been fully addressed. MUT continues to improve each year and looks to be ready for another stellar year.The new DB/WR interactions make play calling more important than ever this year. Just like in real life, if you leave a mediocre DB in one on one with a star WR, be prepared for the consequences. I did not see this as being over powered but more right where it should be to compare to the real NFL experience. Gang tackling is in the game this year and adds another level of realism as the defense reacts to the ball carrier. The same thing plagues this version of Madden that has plagued it for years, and that is this: Pre-Determined Outcomes.This game decides what's going to happen, you don't.  Sure, it gives you the illusion that you have control by letting you press different buttons to throw to different receivers, etc. but the game still ultimately will decide who wins or loses even if they added some new gimmicky catch buttons for receivers.You can have Patrick Peterson and Richard Sherman as your cornerbacks and when the CPU decides it wants to pass the ball it will.  It doesn't matter how bad the opposing QB or WR's are either, they will juke your Hall of Fame CB's out of their shoes and you'll like it.  You can blitz, drop 9 into coverage, play man, play zone, it doesn't matter.  The CPU will win if it decides it wants to.And in the event that you somehow do manage to manually overcome the CPU's desires, the CPU will just pull it's little trump card, the penalty.  What's that?  You finally sacked the QB on 4th and 10?  Well, turns out you face masked him in the process.  Instant first down.  Sorry bout 'cha.This is the single most disappointing aspect of Madden football and it remains in the game year after year after year.  It RUINS the immersion.  It RUINS the feeling that you can actually defeat your opponent through your skill.  Instead of actually programming a solid and dynamic game, the developers rely on gimmicks like that in order to make the game appear to be challenging.  Well, I'm not fooled, I can spot lazy programming when I see it.  And if you think about it, the fact that the game even has varying difficulty levels proves it.  So on the rookie setting your bad left tackle will usually whip that Pro Bowl defensive end.  On All-Madden, your Pro Bowl left tackle will get dominated by a scrub.  What's the point of player attributes again?  Player attributes alone should determine the difficulty.  Build a crappy team, you're going to have a harder time.  Build a good team, and the game will be easier.  This isn't rocket science.I've known about pre-determined outcomes in Madden for a while and I still bought the game because I like to play franchise mode and pretend I'm a GM.  Having said that, there are a few changes to this year's franchise mode.You still spend scouting points on players, but instead of having the ability to unlock an actual attribute as a number, you instead are only allowed to see a letter grade for that player's 3 most important attributes.  At the scouting combine, you'll gain access to their measurables.  So you no longer need to spend scouting points to see what their speed is, if you saw that they ran a 4.28 forty then you know their speed is good.  If you saw that they did 45 reps on the bench press you know their strength is good, etc.So that part's a little different from years' past.  It adds a little more guesswork to your drafting than before since you can't unlock the numerical attribute, but for the most part you can spot a bust before you spend that draft pick on him.Trade logic appears to have improved some.  In years past CPU teams would trade good young players for 1st round picks which made no sense.  It seems teams value their good young players a little more now and won't so readily trade them only to try to draft another good young player to replace him.Other than that, it's the same old Madden.  Good graphics?  Sure.  Fancy presentation?  You bet.  An enjoyable and realistic simulation of NFL football?  Not a chance.  Madden hasn't really changed since 08 and it never will until they throw their entire code away and start from scratch.  And to do it right would take a few years.  Well EA's not going to go years without putting a yearly Madden on the shelves, there's too much money to be made.  Instead they'll update the rosters, tack on a few new gimmicks (this year's new gimmickis the different catch options for receivers) spend exorbitant amounts of money marketing it and laugh all the way to the bank.  EA still has exclusivity with the NFL, so until we as the consumers stop giving them our money (I was guilty this year but hadn't bought once since Madden 11) then nothing will ever change.is the different catch options for receivers) spend exorbitant amounts of money marketing it and laugh all the way to the bank.  EA still has exclusivity with the NFL, so until we as the consumers stop giving them our money (I was guilty this year but hadn't bought once since Madden 11) then nothing will ever change. Overall, the game looks amazing (just like madden 15) and is very engaging. I only have a few real complaints about the game. First, I can't stand Phil Simms as the announcer. I like the guy as a quarterback, but his voice and comments are just headache inducing. I never realized how much I liked John Madden until I've had several years of Phil Simms (no disrespect). Second, navigating menus and different game modes can be rather slow at times. I feel like literally everything has to load and the load times can be painfully annoying. It's nit picky, I know. Third, the new method of catching balls can be kinda comical and ridiculous. I've had instances were you throw a bullet across the middle and some random low ranked Linebacker makes a one handed interception! Or you throw a lob pass and your receiver makes some hug leaping one handed catch (like the one Odell Beckham Jr made). These catches are once in a life time, but now in Madden 16, they can be rather common. It's a video game, I get it. I'm nit picking. It's a fun and enjoyable game at the end of the day. Worth $40 for sure. WORST MADDEN EVER!!! No I'm not a fake this game sucks so bad they changed the passing to make it way to easy for good receivers to make catches with the aggressive catch option trust me this game is so bad and on count of that u can't even skip cutscenes and replay the game takes forever to be done with it because of it. Do not get this game I'm getting Fifa instead which I get every year and at least u can skip the replays and they don't make drastic changes to something that shouldn't have been touched oh and they made passing the option to throw high and low with buttons I don't get it they say it's a new feature when last year with the right analog u can do it and can I say it was much easier this game sucks madden never improves I'm fed up with it I don't even watch soccer but Fifa is a great fricken game not this garbage the announcers haven't changed any of their words from last year same crap! Once you see passing is impossible to defend you will send it back also Very glitchy. Game play is extremely unrealistic and unbalanced as in many many route and combo glitches. I see people blown out by the other person running the same play over and over again all game because it works too well. I downloaded mine on the ps network. The graphic upgrade is nice but the game is technologically broken . pass catching is rather bad n the sense where as all u have to do is throw lob deep ball n aggressive catch n wr will more than likely come down with it leading to online h2h game being a game of 500 instead of football. Cfm got no upgrade except to the preface and Madden has way to many bugs in it , most of which they will not be able to fix . sorry to say but EA sold another broken madden. Where as all the YouTube videos are one time anomolies glitches in 15. They are normal fliches all users will face in Madden 16. U will have dlineman walking offsides aimlessly before offensive players get to line of scrimmage . and other crazy stuff and cfm has so many problems n glitches EA advises not to start a career until the find away to fix the problem which is both on they're end and the client product . I wasted my money. Don't waste yours . played it at my friends house and it was the same as last year, buggy and monotonous Madden 16 is still very buggy through the loading times. I felt why do they have any loads any more. The witcher 3 has almost no loadings desides when you die. Ea can pull off no/minimum loadings.the graphics runs a bit smoother than 15 but nothing to really impress I would advice many people to grab this game later or if you prefer a 60 buggy beta Not happy with this years game and I was pretty satisfied with last years.  Game takes forever to load, is very slow and glitchy.  Graphics however are phenomenal I don't care about covers or that they added videos to their commentary or that they highlight what buttons to press or the camera view I care most about the gameplay itself and its the same as last year. The speed is still not up to par every other thing to do they want you to sign up for PS plus the in game commentary is still the same as last year, same exact playbook that they've been using for the last 20 years bottom line is, don't waste your money!! Freezes after every game in connected franchise mode. It seems like EA would figure this stuff out by now. I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. I'm more of a gameplay guy and my review will be based on that area. Madden 16 by far offers the best overall gameplay experience in the history of the franchise. Some of my favorite additions are as follows:New passing mechanics, new catching mechanics and options, DB/WR interactions, new DB play ball/play receiver mechanics, Organic and gang tackling, QB AI, improved locomotion on the controlled player, ratings being more of a factor, defensive holding and defensive PI. These gameplay additions help Madden 16 to march closer towards to the simulation game I have been waiting for EA Sports to produce. I would also like to add Draft Champions, great mode in my opinion. I don't normally play MUT and DC gives me the ability to play with a fantasy team without any real commitment. At the very most you can play with the same team 4 times, after that it's back to the drawing board. I love suspense factor of always having to build a new team.Of course there are still things left to do and the game still has a few issues which are listed below.I would like to see little to no warping and motion shifting into place.Animation Quality, which the Devs have mentioned themselves. Just want the animations and player movement to look and feel more natural. At times the game still lacks the fluidity that you see in other sports titles.22 Man Physics, I would like to see the physics run at all times and have an affect on every aspect of the game.Physics driven injuries.Signature Animations and Signature Skills for players. I would start with the biggest stars in the league and build from that.New Ratings System, I would like to see position specific ratings and more skill based traits.Jersey pulls and real reach tacklesOutside of that I would just like to see the Devs build on what's already in the game as well. Continue to clean up known issues and build on the foundation you already have set in place.I am also a big CFM player and I will mention that briefly. I like the new scouting system, dynamic goals, storyline commentary including drive starters, and the addition to free practice. I still think there is so MUCH more that could be done in this area to make the game more immersive. There needs to be more off-field activities such has developing storylines that affect game day, contract disputes, chemistry, performance hits for players not practicing, real life draft board, etc. I could go on for days.Madden 16 gives me confidence that the Devs want to get Madden to an elite level. I'm already waiting to see what Air Supremacy looks like in it's second year. If the Devs continue on the path they have going on since Madden 25 I think we have a lot to look forward to. The future looks bright. This game feels like it was made for the stupidest person EA could find, and not for people that play this game.This game plays like Monday Night football with endless soft news, breakaways, and replays.The worst part of this game is the intro, they force you to watch a 15 minute promo to teach you the game, you can eventually get out of it, but it take 15 minutes to get there.I like most of EA customers have played this game before and don't need some stupid tutorial to be forced on me. Why you can't get out the promo is insane, but it is classic EA sports.EA can take a good idea like this and just kill the fun of this game. I like football so I purchased a football video game. I want to play football in that video game and that is all I want to do, I don't want to own a stadium or move my franchise to a new city. I wish they would spend more time on gameplay and graphics.Another silly thing is the Skycam, they now explain that your view is from the Skycam and show it's shadow on the field. How stupid is that, that is like explaining that a documentary camera crew is following you around in Grand Theft Auto. Come on, it is a video game, not Monday Night Football.When you are playing the game I would give it 4 stars.The other stuff, which is like 60% of this game, 1 star. The smoothest gameplay in a long time. Madden is getting back on track! The smoothest gameplay in a long time. Madden is getting back on track! Depending on what modes you play, this is not an upgrade over 15. I only play CFM and CFM is broken in Madden 16. Google it, EA is telling customers to wait before starting their CFM due to bugs.Aside from the fact that CFM is broken in Madden 16, there really are no improvements to CFM that make this game worth upgrading. Relocation is same as last year, there are no new GM type features such as the ability to trade more than 3 of players/draft picks, etc. Just about the only thing new is the menus which I actually don't like as much in M16. Graphics are good but barely improved from last year if at all.It's too bad the NFL doesn't realize that competition would create a better football sim gaming experience for all. Instead we are left with minor updates and broken games.All in all, this game is not worth upgrading to if you own M15.  If you don't own 15 and want the newest version, wait until EA fixes CFM. Better than last years and I thought last years sucked compared to M25 . Worth the money. Fun game Selling this game as I have anger problems because I broke my 2 controllers.too much cheese. Route run and MLB stands in front of my receiver, and after 2 seconds I thought he'd get open, cause real-life, right? Nope, interception, rage. Some people might be fine, others, if you keep playing will give you high blood pressure. Mostly just a joke but definatly believable. Madden 16 is a hot and great game to have in your game collection. this is the same junk EA put out last year. don't be mislead  by 4 star and 5 star reviews. I just finish playing a game. i'll probably be taking this game back to the game store for a refund and put the refund toward Call of duty B3. I wanted to like this game but I could not get pass how it looks and plays like M15 but with a weaker defense  if I was you I would not buy it. just keep playing M14, M15, or go back to M13 The problem is Electronic Arts (EA).  Again, it's the same football game.  The player animations are robotic.  There is some sharpness in the expressionless faces, but it really just adds to the lack of player fluidity.  New features are overstated and unimpressive.  Generally, the new pass-catching options are wasted in a seemingly half-hearted effort.  I see no difference from the old passing controls to the &#34;new&#34; controls.  More annoying Phil Simms and Jim Nance and their idiotic commentary.  It's the same dialogue as before.    I am a Franchise mode player.  The scouting is wasted energy.  Drafting is rather boring, redundant and uninformative.  It is like playing the same game as the last 5 years that I played on PS3, only there is more sharp graphics and much worse player animation.  The game tasks you as a coach or owner to do meaningless work.  The game is so gummed up with unnecessary tasks and options that when you aren't in a game (the same old presentation) it is more of a football business simulation, than a VIDEO GAME.  There is no reason that Electronic Arts can't insert some FUN aspects into a game.  Maybe some real theatre, fun development choices and cut scenes.  Some DEPTH!  We love football but we play the football video game for fun.  Electronic Arts can make it fun but they don't.  Electronic Arts are successful capitalists, but not successful game-makers.  They make money because they know how to market games, and because gamers have no other option when it comes to entire genres.  I suppose if you've never played a football video game then Madden 16 is going to be pretty good.  But if you want to play a complete football game then you are STUCK with EA Football year after year.  EA games are the only games that have ever froze.  I have grown to steer away from games that have the ugly &#34;EA&#34; on the cover of game boxes.  Of course I will play it.  As a football game fanatic, what other choice is there?  I loathe EA's need to control sports game titles. I first want to start my review by saying of course this is like last year and the year before. It's a football game, the new game won't feature players throwing around baseballs. It's like saying each Call of Duty game is the same because soldiers run around and shoot the bad guy.First the prosFace mapping is pretty cool, players in game look like players in real life.New passing system seems to be solid. I do like the catch option though I usually forget to hit any of the buttons.The run game seems more realistic as you will need to follow blockers and sometimes your lineman just gets flat out beat.Defensively I do like that you can fight for the ball better as a db but it doesn't seem like anything else has changed there.There are more motion changes as players jump and fight for the ball, and the ball can be tipped into the air to get picked off.ConsThe play by play needs to be completely revamped. EA needs to get new people, even if they completely rewrite the script, no one wants to hear Phil Simms.If you run the no huddle, there is a good chance the defense will get called for encroachment or offsides. This is a glitch from past years and needs to be fixed.Player dynamics are still weird at times. Legs and arms get bent into Weird positions during tackles and it looks very painful.The in game Sim is not very realistic. I just simmed defense in my last game and my Raiders held the Bears to 5 yards passing and shut them out?Overall I like the game so far, the in game menus are a bit busy for me, the running game is kind of clunky, and not a lot of changes on defense but I have to give it 3 stars. Not too bad. Cant get passed intro screen with Pittsburg and Arizona. MUST make an account with EA sports to even play the game in single player I have been a madden player for a long time. I have always loved madden and it will always be a favorite game of mine. Now I know with games like this that are made year after year it can seem like much of the same. That is true with this game there is an awful lot that is the same but with that said there is a lot that is different and new. The new things added this year make this one of if not the best madden game ever. This years version of the game is fun for the person who is an experinced madden player or someone who has never heard of or played madden before. It is really easy to pick up the controller and play this game. Over the past few years I have bought the Madden games and mostly because it's the only choice we had. They were always decent, but being a big fan or realism in the next gen systems there always seemed to be a stupid glitch, dumb animation, etc. After reading other online reviews I took the plunge on Madden 16. I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.EA Sports seems to have heard most of the complaints regarding the strange, old animations, issues with the instant replay system, etc. and took a step forward to fix them. There is still the weird animation here and there but tackles, hits, they all look pretty legit now. There seems to be a lot more realism with the passing game, and to see the physical battle between receivers and defenders actually play out before the catch is really cool. The graphics are top notch, EA has taken the time to facial scan a lot of players pretty well. The stadiums, crowds etc all look really good too. Commentary is ehh, but most people don't buy Madden for the commentary. I don't play many of the modes, but from what I do play I can tell EA finally stepped up their game and didn't just make the small, incremental changes like most years. They bumped up their game, and this is the best Madden to date in my opinion. I have never had so much trouble with a game. I have had it all day and have yet to be able to play it. The load time is outrageous it took 30 min just to get to the main menu. The core gameplay is better than it's ever been - but for yet another year, EA has shipped a broken product.  EA developers have gone on record to advise customers to not start their &#34;Connect Franchise&#34; (Franchise Mode) until the next patch comes out, as the mode has multiple game-breaking bugs.  Patch timeline?  'No more than six weeks'.My advice?  Wait six weeks and buy the game on sale.  It's incredible that year in and year out, EA ships a game as popular as Madden with game breaking bugs.  Poor quality control and, it seems, an anemic beta testing program.Wish I could strongly recommend this title - I am a football nut and am EA's core demographic.  Thumbs down for now....wait until it's a finished product. Madden NFL 16 is not a roster upgrade this year and that's for sure. The gameplay has been massively improved and the new WR/DB interactions make the game more realistic than ever.Being the Playmaker is totally in your hands. The QB you can throw passes in a number of ways such as Touch, High point, and Low Point. New WR mechanics such as Aggressive Catch, RAC catch, and Possession catch allow you to be in control of your WRs. Your user skills on defense will be tested more than ever this year.The new mode Draft Champions brings Fantasy Football into Madden. The mode can be played solo versus the computer or multiplayer vs other competitors. You will go through a 15 round draft to improve off of your base team. The more you play, the more you learn that some Gold players are better for you than some Elite players. You always be able to draft an NFL Legend in the final round of the draft such as Herman Moore, LaDainian Tomlinson, Ray Lewis, John Elway, Jason Taylor, Ty Law, and many more! Wins will be rewarded with content in Madden Ultimate Team. If you lose, you can begin the whole draft process over again. See if you have what it takes to be a Draft Champion.Madden Ultimate Team has also improved. The Journey is a chain of 100+ games and each one is a game-changing moment from a real NFL game. The Journey starts with Super Bowl XLIX and you are the Seahawks on the Patriots 2-yard line trying to rewrite History. This is just one example of the many you will face on The Journey. With all the programs, new challenges, and new legends - there is no better time to try Madden Ultimate Team.If you liked Madden 15 than you will love Madden 16. It provides a fantastic experience all around and is not the same game with a roster update EA took the best football game ever and made it even better... I would be lying to whomever if I said I wasn\u2019t impressed with Madden NFL 16. From new catching system to the new mode, Draft Champions, Madden has definitely improved from the last cycle. Presentation wise, Madden delivers from the opening with my Steelers vs the Cardinals in what could be a potential SuperBowl 50 matchup. (Don\u2019t believe me? Ray Lewis who had an intro in Madden 13 went to the Superbowl and last year with the Seahawks who went to the Superbowl).Modes wise, I am a huge CFM guy and was pleased with the new UI and commissioner features. Although there are a few things missing to make the mode great, CFM fans will be satisfied with the mode. The new mode \u201cDraft Champions\u201d is awesome for a casual Madden player. You get to draft 15 rounds and battle it out either online or with the CPU.WR/DB interactions has FINALLYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY made it into Madden. Word of advice, don\u2019t think that you will intercept every pass or catch every aggressive deep ball you throw because you will be sadly mistaken and disappointed.Overall, if you haven\u2019t played Madden in a while or you\u2019ve decided to hang up your sticks, give Madden NFL 16 a try. Well its football season and usually I'm purchasing Madden with hopes that its finally good enough to play more then one season before all the hiccups annoy me, and I don't touch it again. Knowing that I might lose between $50-60 can drive you crazy especially if your a football fan. I slid my copy into my PS4 and prayed. I was a bit mellowed after recieving my bonus download for pre-ordering my Madden through Amazon and when the updates finished I was eased into smiling as I liked the initial presentation of playing a few momentous plays in the Super Bowl as the Steelers. All being said its a finally a must buy for football fans, really... How many times have we bought this game, at least for me and been instantly disappointed ? Let's see, everytime !  I immediately sell it and wait for the basketball g9ames.If you are super hardcore Madden guy that plays annually looking for full breakdowns maybe try another review.From the jump, nice cover choice.  However wasn 't this kid a rookie last season ? Quite an Ode to Odell I'd say he's gotta be geeked to see himself on the cover and with three different moving animations on the title screen.  Last year that Seattle title screen was cut and pasted by a child.Probably the best news to me is the new Draft Champions mode.  You draft a 15 round  draft and fill your team up that already has 50-70 rated players.  These players range from high 70's to high 80's, and close off the 15th round with a legend.  It's really nice that each round gives you deptch chart beneath each player, very slick ! If you win three games you go to SB.  If you lose more than one game you're done.  You can play offline or online.  Here's the best part, it replaces MUT, and the craziness of building legend teams that gets so outta hand.  I will still play MUT but this is a way better idea to me, cuz I'm not about to pay out of my pocket towards chasing legends.  Also, why buy the deluxe or super deluxe editions unless you are a MUT freak.  Thanks Draft Champions !The opening game sequence is very cool, with different endings that gets you hyped to play.  However your mom could suceed in its format it's more like a cutscene button push.Gameplay is exciting again with playmaker ability for catching and defending.  That alone is a huge improvement on stale gameplay of the past.I started and ended my connected franchise because I'm really too busy this week, didn't want to take simmed losses.Graphics are almost too good with camera panning in and out at well choreographed times is great but dang so much movement on the screen at times it's a eyeball meltdown.I usually play on all pro, but I went back to pro so I can basically start over.  I have really missed out on many years of changes to controls. It's a bit overwhelming honestly if you haven't played in a while full force.  Basic gameplay is easy to recall, but it's all the micro adjustments at the line of scrimmage that have me a little overwhelmed.Wrapping up.  It plays well.  It's fun again.  It looks great.  This is the first year I didn't have instant buyers remorse.  This is a year you might want to consider downloading the game.  Clearly I was impressed.  I gave it 5 stars, maybe if you were a annual Madden big shot you could give it a 4 cuz other than Draft Champions and playmaker it's the same game, but there's so much polish and the gameplay gets such a big boost.  All of you waiting for a legit Madden to jump back in, this is the year.  Trust me I'm a Madden pessimist.  Jump back in !n all pro, but I went back to pro so I can basically start over.  I have really missed out on many years of changes to controls. It's a bit overwhelming honestly if you haven't played in a while full force.

All of you waiting for a legit Madden to jump back in, this is the year.  Trust me I'm a Madden pessimist.  Jump back in ! Loading times are horrible, game is sluggish and glitchy. Draft Champions mode is interesting. The constant MUT microtransaction ads are annoying, as is asking me to share anything on social media. And as is usual, don't expect anything groundbreaking from EA. Marginal graphics updates, Aggressive, RAC and possession catch options...that's about it. Man, I miss the days before EA had an exclusive license to the NFL and NFLPA. Madden needs competition again!I have been playing Madden for about 16 years, even used to go and stand in line at midnight to buy!I really miss the days that when there was more than just ONE football game available AND we had a college series also, those days are long gone.Imagine a world where there was just ONE racing game available? or just ONE fantasy series game available, would be a bleak world.Well now enters Madden 2016. Yes I will give it the one star only on the presentation, it is almost beyond words, lots of eye candy!You are all hyped up from the presentation thinking of excuses you can use for calling in sick to work the next day because you stayed up to 3 in the morning playing....well I am at work today. After playing two games I made my conclusion, its a SO SO game, I would personally wait until this game is discounted or Red Box it. I think the element missing is that there is no longer other companies producing football games. I think if there were vast amounts of competition out there it may liven up the genre I think Madden has grown content because so what if they produce a crappy product? Its not like you have an option to buy from another company. I would love to see three options released every year bet it would shake things up Best Madden game since the 2005 version. I received this game yesterday and play 2 full games with it.  I had fun.  This is the first Madden game I've played in about 6 years so I can' say if it's the same as last years or not, but I can say if you haven't played Madden in a while you will enjoy this game.The graphics are great, the sounds is OK.  but let's be honest, we only care about gameplay for sports games... I didn't encounter any gliches and the passing/running game seems to be well balanced.  It would probably be even more fun once I figure out all the controls. The game is improved in every way, though not leaps and bounds over Madden 15 because that game was good in itself. More realistic football situations are included this year -- ie. penalties, big time catches (focus is definitely on WR/DB matchup).  Graphics (particularly player face scans) & overall presentation (more realistic crowds) are also slightly improved. If you're a die hard football fan, then upgrading to Madden 16 is worth it due to it's upgrades /improvements.  Worth noting that Prime members get $10.00 off ($49.99). PS4 Madden 16.  Great game, I have been frustrated over the last three years with EA and I love this game. The one knock is I wish it was easier to do an offline Franchise with friends, but it can still be done.  Gameplay is good, computer is actually competitive this year. I love the new aggressive catching, and graphics are amazing. This may be the first Madden I keep for more then a month. I recommend buying this years version. Worst madden ever.  After 17 years of playing madden this years edition is such a terrible disappointment that I will not be buying next year.  The game play is so terrible the only option eat allows you is to simulate because gameplay is absolutely unbearable. Game was broken and buggy on release. They have mad the game worse over time through patches. The game has not played correctly since I purchased it. EA is focused on microtransactions. If you play MUT then you likely have a completely different view of the game than I do.  This was the last EA Sports game I will ever buy. Excellent presentation. It looks like a real life broadcast and the beginning open sequence with the Steelers and Cardinals was a delight.The passing/receiving with the RAC, Possession or Agressive buttons reminds me of those RPG games where you need to press the right button at the right time.  It gets some getting use to but totally unnecessary in my opinion.There are ton of problems. I was playing Franchise mode, in the middle of the game when I was in instant replay, the game froze. It takes forever to just get to the start up page so best be prepared to watch the Beckman jr animations for a good five to ten minutes. Obviously there was a roster download error on day 1. By far the best Madden of all time! Anyone who enjoys the franchise or love the game of Football will love this game! I'm baffled why so many supposed fans of this game come in here and give it a bad review. Have you really played it or just have an agenda against Madden? In either case... Madden took years to come to form. I admit there has been some rough releases over the years.  I've played it since it's first arrival on the beloved Sega Genesis and look what we got now?  It's had a rocky road here and there, and  I understand it's been under heat for being too much like the previous years game, but no worries, they give you just enough to make it feel new.Madden 16 is the first game to utilize penalties to their potential. We finally have them and they work! Pass interference calls? Yep sure are. Holding? Yep. Defensive holding? Sure thing. Late hits penalty calls? You bet!  This makes the game feel more like a real game.  I haven't decided if they're over done yet, but so far, it's pretty standard on what you see in a real game.  It really adds to the realism if you're into the more simulation aspects. It still has the classic controls of Madden.  Truck stick, hit stick, spin move, hurdle, juke, etc.... Long time madden fans will be right at home with it. The newest things are the aggressive catch and possession catch functions. The aggressive catch can make for a amazing eye candy that you have never seen in a football game before, it's so real people walking into the room are thinking they're seeing ESPN highlights. With aggressive catch activated with &#34;triangle&#34; on the PS4, you can make for some spectacular catches and they look spectacular on both sides of the ball. Defensive will also make some amazing attempts to gain possession. Defense can do the same thing, so it's kind of a crapshoot what happens depending if they go up for the aggressive catch. You can make some mistakes if you get hit using the aggressive too much and interceptions can be more gracious. I do like the new function, but as with anything, including the penalties, if you don't like them, turn them off.The game feel more organic than ever. 15 was great IMO already. Sure, you get the occasional times where guys flop around on piles and play possum on the field till they want to get up. Yeah, I understand it looks silly, but does it really interfere with the game itself?  A lot of review sites already say this is unacceptable. I say, it's no big deal. When the game is in play, that's what counts.The game has a fantastic running game. Blockers seem to make holes and are smarter around running down the field with you. The classic truck stick is still there, although I dont think it's as powerful as it once was as a veteran Madden player will probably agree. 16 has a ton of new animations to make the game feel more awesome. There's some brutal hits going on in this game. Although I've probably put in 10 hours already, I haven't had any injuries? hmmmm.Passing feels good. I actually prefer to play on the game speed on &#34;very slow&#34;. I think normal or even slow is too much speed for me, but that's just a preference.  QB's with lower ratings finally are making more incomplete passes and they are definitely inconsistent! That's good! I noticed in 15, QB's with bad ratings were sometimes going 25 for 27 in one game! Now if your QB is just a bench guy or not very good in general, you'll see a lot of short and overthrown passes. This is a good thing again if you're playing a team with strong running game, but a passing game, not so much. QB's seem to get more rattled. As mentioned above, you're going to see some great one on one battles with the new &#34;aggressive&#34; catch option.  IF you want to play things safe, you can go for the regular catch or possession. Going for strictly possession, you lose the ability to get yards after a catch. Some people like to just let the cpu do all the work, that's fine, but you lose your ability to make big plays. That's the rules with madden for years, if you take over, youhave a better chance at making something big happen!Defensively is still fun with the &#34;behind the back perspective&#34; Sometimes I feel like the camera does some funky things after a pass, but I can usually play good defense sticking with this angle. The hit stick, while still there, doesn't seem as intense as past years? (Is this the NFL saying tone is down EA?) I sure hope not. Either way, it's good we still have the ability to make a big hit to cause those fumbles!Presentation is better than last year, but it's not light years better. Some new commentary lines here and there, a bit more details, but they still sound like they're reading too much. Not horribly bad, but needs a rehaul for next year.The graphics are stunning. The players faces got the most love, you'll see that in the intro. Very detailed stadiums, amazing use of lighting and shadows and spot on reflections on the helmets.  Some of the cut scenes they show in between plays etc are a bit over done, but hey, if you like presenation, there ya go!The classic and most beloved mode is back, the Ultimate Team mode. Build your team of scrubs into the ultimate Madden team and take them online!Speaking of online, I haven't had any major issues, EA has always had decent servers. I've only noticed a few games with a little input lag, but it's very good considering how many people were playing at once.Madden 16 is a great game. Anyone new to the series should pick it up. I don't know if I can justify 60 bucks if you have 15, but if you're a Madden fan like I am, I already know that you probably already have it. God bless.ng big happen!

I really wish Amazon would let us do half stars in reviews because 5 out of 5 is too high but 4 out of 5 is too low, but to me the game is closer to 80 than 100, so I wanted to keep the rating realistic.Each year of the PS4 / XB1 era, Madden has continuously improved in many areas, but still lacks in the additions on the CFM side; which keeps it from reaching a perfect score.  The area they have best excelled in is gameplay, and it has come a LONG way since it's current gen debut.The great part of the gameplay comes with a new wrinkle of the WR/DB interactions.  It feels like there is a true jostling between the two players with true results.  Not only do you get true results, but the animations and look and feel are fresh with every pass attempt.  Speaking of the pass attempts, you can do a lot with QB to get it to the WR in the best possible way from holding down the button for a bullet pass, double tapping the button for a touch pass, or tapping the button once for a lob.  You can modify using L1 or LB for a high pass and L2 or LT for a low pass, and once you get the hang of these mechanics, you can start doing them without thinking about it when the situation arises.While it is disappointing that CFM is pretty much unchanged, and still isn't as engaging online as the Online Dynasty was in NCAA Football.  There are still some great additions, including a long time commish wishlist item, choosing the winner for simulated games.  I also really like the dynamic drive goals.  Much like the dynamic goals in NBA 2K's MyPlayer mode, it gives a level of immersion and changes it up for you instead of just sticking to your same ol' gameplan.  It makes you change things up, but really doesn't penalize you if you choose not to accept the mission.  I also like the running tally of game, season, and career goals for the players showing at the bottom after a play as well.  Those are some welcome tweaks.The biggest new mode of Madden 16 is Draft Champions, and it is fun as hell.  First you choose your coach that will give you style boost for one offensive and one defensive group, then you draft 15 players to mold your team.  You'll be shown three players and you have to choose one.  The great thing about this is when you highlight the player, it also highlights your current depth chart below so you don't draft two studs at the same position.  That is very slick.  I could have done without Adam Schefter's commentary after picks though.  The players that come up will be a balance between gold and elite Ultimate Team players with the 15th and final round drafting a legend.  You'll then try to win three games to be the Draft Champion either solo or online with friends.  I think it's a great way to play Madden for some competition with friends on a random night.Speaking of Ultimate Team, it is back with a very sharp new logo and a bunch of new content as well.  There are well over 150 solo challenges to do in the new Journey; which are full of scenarios and not just full games to beat.  Not only is it something new to try to beat with your Ultimate Team, but it is a great way to get your team started as well because each challenge gives you coins and sometimes packs to help build your team without having to break the bank early on buying packs.And finally, I'm not going to give any spoilers, but the opening playable scene is AMAZING and props to those who had a hand in creating it.Overall, Madden 16 is VERY close to achieving their ultimate goals, and if they work on Connected Franchise next year with what the community wants to see, they will reach those goals. Best madden game in a long time This is the best madden in a good long time, and while not without flaws, there are a host of improvements.  Positives:  - Visuals are fantastic. Players look great and hell even the coaches actually look good. They almost exactly capture Tom Coughlins ancient insect monster look.  -Presentation is vastly improved. There are many new on screen indicators, including catching controls, player milestones and xp gains. The instant visual feedback is very satisfying.  -Commentary doesn't suck for once. Most of the commentary isn't repetitive drivel and is actually accurate. I haven't ran into that moment where you hit your receivers in the hands and he drops it and it's referred to as a &#34;terrible throw by the quarterback&#34; or you accidently throw it right at a defender and it's called &#34;a great play by the secondary player.&#34;  -Most of the bugs have been ironed out. For example I was always annoyed in franchise mode when it gave your players stats from last week and each stat had a 0. That's been fixed. Also most of the funky animation issues have been ironed out.  -Animations are great  -It now takes a realistic amount of time for the offense to run a no huddle, so that can't be spammed as often anymore.  -New mechanics on offense and defense are interesting and work well. Back are the great defensive changes from last year but added to it are new mechanics for the qb, receivers and secondary players. In addition to the traditional bullet and lob passes, you have a touch pass, which is between a bullet and lob and is useful for things like slant patterns. In addition you can aim high or low with the left trigger and bumper, respectively. Now one on one patterns have added depth as you can aim it high and have your receiver go up and get it. This adds excitement to deep routes and makes fades actually work.  As for receivers there are now three options on how to catch the ball. If you want to just make sure the ball is caught, you can press a(x) and he willcommit to catching the ball but the odds for yards after catch are low. If you press x (square) you will attempt a run after catch, useful for when you're wide open and want to maximize yardage. And if you press y (triangle) you will do an agressive catch which is great for one on one situations and if you just want to see some highlight reel stuff.  As for the secondary, while in coverage you have the option to play either the ball for an int or the receiver and try to prevent the catch.  -There are some minor changes to MUT and franchise. While not major they do clean up the experience a bit.  -The cover athlete. This didn't actually affect my rating but what can I say? I'm a giants fan.  Negatives:  -Some old issues persist, for example if you get outbid when in an auction house sometimes your coins won't return in time to make a bid. It's an annoyance I had last year and while it's slightly less frequent, it persists and sometimes you have to exit the auction house and reenter just to get your coins back. You can imagine how much of a nuisance that is when you only have 15-20 seconds to place a bid.  -Little change to the old modes and the new one, draft champions isn't all that compelling. At least in my opinion. Other people seem to enjoy it, so take that with a grain of salt. I would love for them to bring back the old practice modes like throwing the ball through rings. Those were a ton of fun.  - There were some issues that seem to have been only present during the 5 day ea access preview. For example during that time there were frequent performance issues, particularly frame rate drops. Also there was an issue where all my MUT cards, including those opened in packs, were blank. However since release, the frame rate has been stable and the blank card issue corrected, so I don't anticipate those being an issue any longer.  -The soundtrack isn't anything to write home about. Can't Feel my Face is my jam, but for the most part the music is pretty unremarkable,again in my opinion.  Overall this Madden was a pretty pronounced improvement over the previous which in turn was a nice improvement over 25. I feel right now the gameplay experience is about as good as it can be. Next year I would instead like to see an emphasis on improving existing game modes and introducing a nice amount of new ones. Maybe a story mode NBA 2K style. That would be freaking sweet. This Madden has been very fun to play so far , the gameplay is much smoother and reaction/interactions are a lot more fluid and smooth which is great to see , they are really moving forward each season with this game.The new WR/DB interactions are nice and bring something new to the game that adds some strategy as well , you are not going up for an interception everytime and getting it and the same goes for a deepball , using each catch and defend button at the right time is very key to success and I love the strategy that it adds to the game.The new Draft Champions is amazing , thats all  I can say about this mode. I am truly addicted to it , you can play this mode to and also have at least one legend each draft. I have been playing it and it also helps with my MUT team as far as being able to use guys for FREE and determine if I like how they perform on the field,not to mention you get rewards to help you in MUT as well. Its a great and addicting FREE mode that I can't get enough of.In MUT there are more solos and challenges you can play , more content as well.  I am not totally won over with MUT as far as payouts , odds and how the leaderboard is still done by coins and not wins or a points setup but its still a great mode that has more to offer this year and I will have fun playing. While its not setup exactly how i'd prefer I think overall it has improved which tells me there are going in the right direction.Overall , the gameplay is much smoother and improved , the addition of draft champions is alone a game in itself that could keep me busy for months , MUT has improved and the new interactions between the DB's and WR's are a welcome addition as well, when a game moves forward I am always happy. Very good game. I like the new feature where you can having your receiver be aggressive or defensive back the same way. I like it. It's seems very smooth. Some of the Ratings aren't the best. Dez Bryant lower than Brown. I got mine at $%#% where when you traded in your copy they game you 30 off for it. So it was only 30 bucks after all said and done. I don't play the players so it isn't worth my while to buy the limited edition. The franchise mode is about the same. A feel bells and whistles, Haven't Dived into it yet. I like the old versions, If it was like the show to some extent it would be amazing and I would play it all the time. With that being said. I like the game so far. They need to over haul the franchise mode though I feel like I have to place a disclaimer at the beginning of this review for those that absolutely love the game and despise anyone who thinks differently: I hope this review doesn't offend you. This is my opinion. Don't get cranky because I don't like this game.With that out of the way, this is another year of EA sucking $60 out of wallets for not much more than upgraded rosters. This is another year where the mechanics of the game feel just like every other Madden game. Another year of these 'new' features promised by EA to 'change the game' when I don't believe that is the case at all. EA has done a great job at 'forcing' consumers to purchase the new game each year just so they can enjoy new rosters. I'm honestly curious as to how many people would actually purchase the game each year if EA offered roster updates for the previous year as well. My guess is that they would lose out on a lot of money. For that reason alone, it makes sense for them to lock down the fact that users have to buy the new game if they want to play with the new people. As a corporation, I get it. As a consumer that has to spend $60 for that being the (for the most part) largest feature each year, it pisses me off.These 'new' additions of Total Control Passing and Integrated Broadcast Graphics are the same features that EA boasts are new and improved each year. If you'll recall from Madden 15, EA released a 'Best of Broadcast' function that claimed to include new broadcast and cameras that capture the emotion of every play from fresh new perspectives. The Integrated Broadcast Graphics of this year claim that the playmaker highlight reel has new player spotlights, dynamic goals and achievements, and innovative on-the-field cameras that bring you closer to the game than ever before. I just feel like EA is beating a dead horse each year, and I'm fed up with it.I find myself buying these games each year with the hope that EA will produce a game that feels fresh and new, deserving of a new $60 rather than pumping out roster updates and claiming to be the newest and best. Unfortunately, this is going to be my last Madden purchase until I see something that is actually game changing. I'll stick with a previous version and just download my own custom rosters that fellow Madden lovers provide to the community.I wish I had positive things to say about this game, but I don't. I'm just tired of pretending that this is a great game just because it's new. Maybe I'm getting older and finding that this isn't what I'm looking for in a new game. Maybe I'm just coming to terms with the fact that the Madden franchise just isn't what it used to be. Whatever the case may be, it pains me to say that I don't like this game, but I'm not scared to admit it anymore.ew $60 rather than pumping out roster updates and claiming to be the newest and best.

This year's game host new features and old favorites that should appeal to anyone who has been a fan of the Madden Series. I will go over all the different modes you have to play. One of the new features that brings a whole new experience to the game is Be the Playmaker. You now have three different catch options to chose from. They are as follows.1. Aggressive catch: This is a high risk/high reward option. Say you are down a score with little time remaining on the clock and need a big play. Using the aggressive catch could provide you the score or yardage needed to win the game. But beware, your receiver has a lower chance of catching the ball. It could however, be just the thing to lead your team to victory.  It's all up to you now.2. Possession catch: You this when you need a clutch pass to your receiver. You most likely won't get any additional yards after the catch but it comes in handy when you need a big play from your QB and receiver.3. RAC Catch: Look to use this play when you need your receiver to make the big play and turn it up the field for more addition yardage after the catch. I would only use this when he's pen because you do have a much bigger chance of throwing an interception id he's cover well.Another new feature in this year's game is called Draft Champions. I will be honest, when I first heard about this new mode of play, I was not impressed at all. I thought, here we go, another new gimmick I won't be playing. I could have not been more wrong. When I fired up the menu, I saw the Draft Champions mode and said, what the heck, I will give it a try. Now, I'm glad I did.

You can replay this opening of Madden NFL 16 as many times as you want. It's a great way to get a taste of the game.In closing,Madden NFL 16 is just a flat out fun game to play for anyone who has enjoyed previous versions of the Madden series. It's not without is faults however, but has more than enough good traits to keep you coming back for more. This is the game Madden fans have been waiting for. I, for one, am glad Madden Season is finally upon us! From a seasoned madden player you can't go wrong. It's worth the $60 even if you still enjoy madden 15. The tackling is improved. The new mini games are fun. The graphics have been improved. The physics have been tweaked. The computer ai is improved. The stadium crowd and sound effects are improved. The graphics look a lil better. Nothing huge just the small stuff that people that notice small details will enjoy. Is it perfect? no. It has its flaws,  but if you want a real football experience then just watch it on tv.", "Great deal\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01 Great game fast shipping True, this game has flaws. I was originally turned away by the 'Copy/Paste' scandal of 2013. I now forgive them. Billion dollar deadlines can do strange things to people. In fact, after recently purchasing a used copy on a whim, I think this is the best overall game in the series. Does it have interesting characters like Captain Price? No, but Captain Price was recycled from CoD 2. Are there hackers in multiplayer? Sure, but not as many as there were in MW2. Ask yourself what you expect from the series. To me the answer is: &#34;Six hours of fast-paced bang-bang action and ridiculous set pieces in a semi-post-apocalyptic setting (or at least a really bad neighborhood, or airport), including helplessly getting knocked to the floor by a random explosion, followed by 20-1,000 multiplayer hours of getting sniped by twelve year-olds hopped up on Mountain Dew.&#34; Nowhere in that description are exo-limbs, super jumping, laser rifles, or Kevin Spacey running for his life. This may be the last Call of Duty with normal jumping. Think about that, and also realize that the Hardened Edition is only $26 and includes $50 in DLC (the codes still work). It's a great value, even if you're paying for recycled materials. Besides, what were you expecting?", "Charge last fit days with daily use of Xbox one controller.

Great merchant i beat the game within 24 hours which would have been impossible with the game boy advance version which was much like the show unlike this one. they butchered the game and the pokemon season that came with it. the 8th gym leader was wrong, the original champ was the 8th gym leader in the new one. the elite four was easy as hell to beat. i defeated the entire elite four and the champion with just my level 52 groudon using only one either and thats it. i dont recommend this game it was a waste of money. i used to love the pokemon series because it was a challenge now they are so easy that you could use your first pokemon to take out an entire gym or arc in the game. its pathetic. dont buy. Great! Gift for my grandson who said he loves it and was playing it when I called to wish him happy birthday.  He had had it a few days and was still enjoying it very much. very good product It's a remake of an old game, there's not much alse to be said. The only real addition are the mega evolutions and the delta episode after the elite 4 which adds a few more hours of gameplay. The game is very easy, which no difficulty option to select, I find myself imposing handicaps on myself to make the game more enjoyable. It has the same old tired battle system as pokemon red and blue, and no story to speak of. It's an okay game, but if you've already played the original, there is no reason to pick this up. Super fun!

If you have battery problems with your wireless controllers like me, I'd recommend just buying the wired controllers- easier plug in and they went down in price to about $27 since I bought mine a month ago for $30 The drivers are old and I could never get this receiver working right on windows 7.don't waste your money. Drivers needed to be manually setup, but other than that. Super happy with the purchase. Exactly as shown Good works wonderfully. its a must have for anyone who plays games on PC. Works! A little issue trying to get installed with Windows. Doesn't want to recognize it but you can get to work. Not Microsoft certified driver so you have to force it to use it. Able to be done and works fine! Took some small effort to get it working, but it does work if you follow the instructions others have posted. Works great! Just be wary that you'll probably need to tinker around a bit to get it working, depending on your operating system. Some of the other reviews here have some tutorials for the necessary steps, so just follow them. What I thought this was ended up not being it at all;however, still is something I wanted. install disk didn't work for the drivers but i found that windows already had the drivers on it. Still haven't figured out how to get it connected... It worked, but after a month it caused major driver issues. Any game I played with it, would soon cause random movement for my character. I tried other drivers along with a clean installation of Windows. I have another receiver that was officially from Microsoft and its been a year and that hasn't had any issues, but I needed another one for my sister, but couldn't find the official Microsoft wireless adapter. Works as intended. I love it! Works great stopped working after only a few months of minor use... Worked perfectly and let me play guitar hero on my computer using a wireless guitar. Works like a charm, just make sure to follow the instructions on one of these reviews. but after that works no problem! (Windows 10  64-bit) This device will NOT work with Windows 10. All of the top reviews with instructions on how to get the device working are for Windows 7. I just spent 30 min talking with Microsoft Technical Support and they confirmed there is no driver support with any Operating system newer that Windows 7. The receiver I purchased did not work and is not worth the cheaper price. Buy the Microsoft one and save yourself the trouble. Worked great, easy to set up!", "Love em I really love this headset, I bought them for my PC & they work great. sound quality is great & the wireless has a good range. My only complaint was there were no instructions for installation for PC in the box( X Box & PlayStation only) & no instructions on how long to charge them for, but I was able to find them online.I would also like to add (this has nothing to do with the headset) that I had to return a headset I was not happy with & Amazon's Customer Service is the best, they should have a school for other businesses on how to give customer service because there is none better. FIVE STARS FOR AMAZON ALSO. terrible and cheap headphones... do yourself a favor an save the $40 on better headphones Terrible. i got these and within one hour, boom, they dont work. i setup everything the way they were supposed to be, but it just won't put any sound through at all. Not worth your 40$ Husband loves them can hear everything.", "it's ok Excelent sound. I like the mic design a lot. The quality of the product is also very good. Excellent sound, good microphone. It gets a little uncomfortable after a couple hours so I just readjust it and I'm good to go for another hour or so. For the price, it cannot be beat. Play a game like Until Dawn using these headphones and it is a completely new experience! Buy these if you're on a budget, screw the haters and trolls. The comfort is fine. I also have a huge bead if you're curious - maybe that has something to do with it? Just buy them already, you won't find better audio for the price The audio was amazing and no complaints on chatting. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because it was extremely uncomfortable. I could only wear it for about 15min and I would have to take it off. I had to return due to it being uncomfortable. Absolutely a must if your a gamer. Excellent sound and comfortable on your head for hours of fun. I've seen these go for over fifty dollars in gaming stores. Its a cheap piece of trash that you shouldn't waste your money on even if you aren't expecting much. Buy a cheap pair at walmart for $5 dollars that will probably last longer and feel more comfortable. Broke in less than a month with careful usage. The cord got caught on something and ripped the second day we had these. Not very durable Amazing headset :) thank you bro Seem great so far better than expected. Comfortable and good size. Way cheaper to buy here than GameStop worth the 20 bucks 50 dollar mic easily. Excellent The plastic head band cracked and then broke in less than three months of on and off use. They broke on me too.  The headset is cheap plastic and no matter how careful you are with them, they will eventually wear out and break.The sound quality was excellent for the price, it would be a great buy if even remotely durable. Awesome headset The headband WILL break.  It's just a matter of when.  They do sound good, though.", "Can't go wrong on this one Great mouse! Love it....changes color....pretty cool.....good software to make button changes......I like Anker. 3 years passed and my final conclusion: absolutely not suitable for fast 1st person games (like Q3 excessiveplus rail). 3 step low accuracy comparing to my old A4tech X7 mouse. Or maybe its just some technical problem of my mouse. But all the same have bad experience with it. Does a good job for a lot less than a Logitech mouse. It's a great mouse, especially if you have large hands. Great quality for the price. Nice mouse. However, the software is compatible with Windows operating systems ONLY. If you have a mac and are running any version of OS X as your main operating system, you are completely out of luck. Renders 90% of the features useless. They have no plans to support OS X either, so buyer beware. **Just a heads up for FPS guys - you can set the side mouse button to a Key, say C for crouch, which is nice.  However, the side buttons merely toggle the key, even when held in.  So if your play style is to crouch by holding C, you're going to crouch and come back up immediately, even if you're holding in the side button.I purchased this mouse exactly 1 year and 11 months ago today.  Within the first 3 weeks I had an issue with the laser not tracking correctly.  The mouse would move in unintended directions on the screen.  I wrote the company and they replaced the mouse with a new one.Since then, it's done the job.  Granted, I was trying to save a buck at the time, so I settled for this guy.  It feels like a mid-grade mouse.  However, within the past few weeks, I've noticed that my right mouse button does not register as well as it used to.  Now I'm an avid FPS gamer, I probably play 3-5 hours per week, and occasionally I'll play an MMORPG.The Right mouse button failures are most noticeable when sniping, the failure has robbed me of numerous kills and has even caused me to die several times.Also, the scroll wheel seems to cry or squeal every time I use it now.Basically, this mouse was good while it lasted, but don't expect it to last too long.  Spend the extra $20 and get something that will survive the FPS abuses. I just ordered the Logitech G502 Proteus Core, I'm going to have to learn a whole new mouse :( Nice little inexpensive mouse.I bought this to replace a 20 year old MS Intellipoint mouse for work, wanted more buttons.Pros:-Ergonomic (although it seems this is more for a palm grip style, not claw grip like me)-Weights can be added to base of mouse for weight (nice touch since it is rather light without them)-All of the buttons are programmable to a key press, macro, button combo, etc - very easy setup with their software (you must manually download)-Price (just over $20 at the time with promo code)-Sturdy construction - does not feel flimsy at all, feels nice in your hand. The Scroll wheel itself has a great feel to it and solid click-Software - completely custom - can change DPI settings, color of logo, breathing rate, button settings, click and scroll speed, etcCons:-Even though this is ergonomic, it feels like it was made for Left handed people (I am right handed). This may be because I have more of a claw type grip instead of palm, but it &#34;feels&#34; more natural if I hold it in my left hand. Not really a con, but something to note - and not something to take a star away.Really a great Anker product. I have become a big fan of this company's products - from USB chargers to my iphone case to portable battery packs and now this mouse. They are all very well packaged and user friendly.Their promo codes and sales are icing allowing you to get a huge bang for your buck.Quality product, definitely recommend this mouse to those looking to branch our from the norm and want something with some customization on it without breaking the bank love this mouse, the thumb buttons should be a little higher but still works great.", "very glitchy and the graphics are not as good as Dragon Age 2. on the whole very unhappy with the game. Once again you have not failed to deliver what I needed and it was in great condition I enjoy ordering from you all thank you so much again Good game, seems to be a fitting successor, but the PS3 version is buggy and prone to sudden crashes, which EA has said they won't fix (no further updates or DLC for PS3/XBox 360). If you get it, save often! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS GAME", "Can't wait till this game come in I know it's awesome Amazing game. TLOU is an unbelievable story! Love this game!! This game is one of the most immersive I have ever played. I was easily involved in the story and presentation. Outstandingly beautiful. Gameplay ranges from tense to punishing, It is almost like a zombie Metal Gear Solid in that there are multiple ways and routes to pass a zone, from stealth to guns blaring. Compelling voice acting in the cutscenes is well done. Normal difficulty was challenging. Greater difficulty can become downright maddening, Many collectible flesh out story. First playthrough took about 20 hours but I did a good job of exploring and taking in the very, very pleasing scenes and color palette. Replay revolves mostly around collectibles and difficulty, meh. I would absolutely recommend this game. Excellent.The quality is great. Storyline engaging. Play it, or get infected. I didn't like that it was shipped like crap overall I love it Best freaking game ever.  I have replayed this game three times and it is good each time. this game was great. I normally don't go for the story line games but the story line in this game is awesome. As much as I enjoy this game, its like the Frozen or Minions of games. It's too overrated. My favorite game of all time is Beyond Two Souls, not this. I like it, its a great story, great graphics and great acting, but my biggest problem is the game is made too challenging and is too much action and not enough character development.The cutscenes are short, and not worth the countless hours of sneaking around, shooting and getting killed. Yes I like it, but I enjoy it more watching it as a walkthrough than playing it. Excellent!! not the genre i usually play but this game is fantastic. simple story that sucks you in. bought as a replacement for my original disc which stopped working. love this game :)", "Not my favorite. Perfect shape. Everything was with it. Arrived before expected. Thanks The disk was scratched but other than that It runs nicely I like it. Not for kids younger than 16-17. I bought this item in my local GameStop for a bit cheap but anyways this game has probably one of the best graphics than some games that I played I luv this game I can do so much even after finishing the game one of the bad things is that amazon didn't have this game at the time and I ended up paying $60 It kep freezing and the disc 1 won't work but I got to play the game a lil bit and great \ud83d\ude24 excellent Awesome, I am so happy Amazon exists because none of the discs were scratched and they run smooth Love this game, a very fun game. You can be other people which is different from all the other games. This game is so much fun, highly recommend!", "So I bought the xbox one from Fred Meyers, and I am extremely displeased. The installation time is ridiculous. And for disk games, installation shouldn't even be a requirement. Microsoft was very unhelpful. They also told me that in order to play the game I'll need to put the disk in. So I download a game, but need the disk the disk. What?! If you want something better get a good pc. That's what I did and it's much better. First of all, you have to have to have wifi in order to sign in to your profile. Xbox 360 is so much better so buy that instead of this garbage. When I open a product, I expect it to start working in 60 seconds. Just like my iPad.It has been over 24 hours. We have been unable to play the game that came with the console. Why? Because we are still downloading the game! It is 20% done after a full day of download. What an awful experience on my birthday! See attached picture.First it took 3 hours just to start the Xbox One. Very unhappy that it took 3 painful hours to get to the welcome screen. Microsoft, is this cool? (Starting the console required a mandatory ~300 MB system update. I have a ~105 Mbps high-speed cable internet line from Comcast. Xbox one has a wired connection. Xbox is receiving internet speed between of 80 - 90 Mbps. Although the game file is downloading at about ~1 Mbps)Dear Microsoft Product Managers, here is a challenge for you. When a customer starts their Xbox One they should be able to begin using it in 60 seconds or less. If it takes several days to start using their game console then Steve Jobs is right about your sense of taste. And from my experience over the last 24 hours - a lack of respect for your customer's emotions.Folks, wish me happy birthday! works perfectly and got it for a great price If you have any limitations on your internet connection do not buy an Xbox one. Since it has a DRM scheme where you never get the whole game on the DVD and must download the last part. It's like that $#it program Steam for console. Because of this and lack of control over internet usage  and lack of consideration for bandwidth usage it is a massive hog of bandwidth. I moved to console gaming after years of PC gaming because you can't truly own or trade your pc games anymore. I was very disappointed after owning the 360 to by this poorly designed system with little flexibility and control. Today's DRM schemes are just an inconvenience for honest consumers. I hope there stupid move to this DRM scheme costs Microsoft. I sold mine and got a PS4 that I am much happier with and can play games off line and video quality is better.Also running the cable box signal through the Xbox is krap. I have a 56&#34; 1080 tv and there's a notable drop in picture quality to 720 quality or less. Why even put in the option if it doesn't work well. Like Microsoft has done with Windows releases in the past, this console was not fully developed or thought out. Way to go Microsoft you did it again. This is one of the BEST consoles I have ever owned! I am a huge gamer and I've been using the xbox 360 core ever since it came out back in 06. Microsoft has always done amazing with their consoles and I am looking foward to seeing what is next! Here is the 1 downside of it: I have the 500gb console and I can tell that it WILL run out of internal storage. You can't remove the hard drive like in the 360s, so that is one of the only dissapointments I had with the console. Most games take up about 20-50 gb and if you just get the downloaded games, you WILL run out of space..... But hey, if you want all the space, just get the 1tb console and it will last a lot longer. I am pleased and happy with this console and I expect to get the most out of it while I'm into gaming! P.S.: I reccomend getting a recharging station for the controller because AA batteried do not last long. I hope this review is helpful to those looking top buy one!", "I've had the game for over a week now and I have to say it's pretty awesome. The gameplay is a step above Awakening, the characters are great, and the story is amazing. This game requires a lot more strategy then Awakening did. I sometimes spend over an hour to do some chapters. Be warned that this is a Japanese game and you will need a Japanese 3DS to play it. However, there are hacks you can use to play it on non Japanese 3DS like tubehack for example. I definitely recommend this game and I can't wait for it to be released in America I'll buy it again. I got this game as a gift, and I'm in love with it! The gameplay is very smooth, there's new battle tactics, and the story is amazing. You can also change your hairstyle as much as you want once you unlock the My Castle feature. If you plan on getting both routes, DON'T GET BOTH COPIES. You can purchase the other route in game after you finish your initial route. I'm not sure if it will be like this for the American adaption, but the only way to obtain the Invisible Kingdom path (the third path) is to have both routes on one cartridge.", "I have several versions of each of these games for some reason, but I don't mind.  Some are originals such as MGS on PS1 (2 discs!) and MGS3 regular and Subsistence (Monkeys!).  I was still compelled to purchase this since it bumps up a series I love so much to HD (or near in most cases) into a compact 2-disc package and the price was right.  Strangely, it is missing &#34;Portable Ops&#34; which introduced the whole comrade system used in Peacewalker and MGSV.  Anyway, to me it was worth it to play Peacewalker with dual analogs and the Ashley Wood motion comics with full voice.  Be advised though:-No art book was included (I understand this is a second printing)-MGS and MGS VR Missions are both downloads via code included on paper insert.  Have not tested if they work on the Vita yet.-Both motion comics are on Disc 2.  When loaded, look under the &#34;Video&#34; icon on the PS Home Screen.Enjoy! I'm just starting to get into the series and I thought to myself, &#34;why not start here?&#34;. My package came an entire day early and brand new sealed and everything. Of course no art book because that's what the description says, but who cares about that anyway. I can't wait to play it. It's so fun playing through all of the games in the series. The earlier titles do feel a bit dated thanks to the control limitations of the time, but for the most part these games hold up. Can't wait for the fifth entry in the series!", "I love it Works great No problems fine I use this remote with the Mario Kart 8 Racing Wheel...great combination...also used in some of the other games...good control...fast action...well worth the price", "Hands down, the best streaming media device on the face of the earth! The best Android TV player on the market.  I love the sound control on the remote - you don't get that with other Android TV devices.  I'd really like it if they would offer another controller as an option - the game-style controller is not exactly what I want to control Android TV with, but again, I love the volume control and the headphone jack on the controller. I didn\u00b4t bought it for gaming experiance... far too old for that... but instead for full Android TV experiance. And yes, it completely matches my expectation. It is fast, easy and worry free. And the best: As I am from Germany and bought it from Amazon US (not yet available here), it automatically switched to German language and everything is as on any other Android device I own... PERFECT!The only thing I would have preferred is to have the &#34;standard&#34; remote with the Shield, instead of the Game Pad. Superb device . Love it \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude0d great product Shipped to canada just fine. Works great but the game stream function is only limited to a number if games. Other games just don't work, I get a blank screen, sometimes u get just audio. So I can't take advantage of my full steam library. It works great as a chromecast and even better on it's own. Youtube, Netflix and plex are awesome. I wish the interface/home screen was a bit more customizable though. Wow is all I can say! I've had most video streaming boxes and this beats everything I've seen by a very wide margin.Streams video like a boss. I also am a cord cutter so if you use OTA TV, this combined with a Tablo is excellent.If you also play games, this is a great solution. I stream PC games and it runs great (check your PC to see if your up to specs for this).Only thing I added was a bluetooth keyboard and mouse for some of the non-controller type games.If your in the market, just add to cart. You won't be sorry. I love this box. Works well. Definite buy Just purchased opened and plugged in my Nvidia shield console and at the setup screen does not let me choose a language. it seems the controller is not connected as when buttons are pressed there is no response from the system. But controller is on and connected even with use of the connection wire. I then plug a mouse in to fix this issue and get through the initial setup stages. I am able to choose US English, then brings me to choose my wifi and again nothing clickable no response from my controller or my mouse. At this point the system randomly decides to reset and load me back to the start of the setup and not able to start my Nvidia shield console.I cannot contact the Nvidia support as they are an online only live chat and I have been waiting in the queue as first in line for more than 3 hours now. I currently Hate Nviidia and am no longer a fan of their hardware. If anyone has a fix for this problem or has any similar problem to mine please leave a reply below.Amazon refunds only $20 usd  and my shipping was $50 usd so i need to fix this Asap. The shield was exactly what I hoped for. It is a android powerhouse boasting the best specks. It lacks app support from many I'd like to see added. This leaves my gaming somewhat lacking but the streaming is amazing. I have even added Kodi without side load and runs flawlessly. If you want to add a micro sd I recommend you make sure all updates are installed because I thought the sd was broken since it could not be read but was soon after fixed when I downloaded the update update. First class Clearly bug ridden out of the box. Patching would be good if you can actually patch it.  Stay away from buying this unless you want to risk of getting alot of aggraviation. Good Absolutely the best &#34;smart tech TV companion&#34;My 4 year old son loved it I purchased this mainly for emulators. The $30 google play credit came in handy for buing some of the better emulators for classic systems.I've has no issues playing Saturn, PSP, N64, PSX, Genesis, Snes, and nes.  This has replaced my Alienware Alpha.Game streaming from my GTX 970 also works great A++ Fantastic Its great, best box ever Even works in Norway! so far its the best option i have found..", "Fit great. Shared extra one with a friend. My son was EXTREMELY excited to get them. I had already ordered them when he showed me these exact ones he wanted. These little covers not only protect your controllers but also makes them look really cool and they fit perfectly", "Awesome! My all time favorite game except 343i shut down the multiplayer servers. Disappointed given the fact that Halo CE for PC can still play online", "Work great These are as they say they are. Nothing fancy but they work. My kids have fun with them. Shipping was fast. Broken when received them.  Not worth the money.", "New Game! Sweet", "Its, perfect, thank you A little spendy but the sound quality is amazing and it works perfect out of the box on PS4 or a PC (Windows 10) with Skype. I had the Sony Pulse before these and broke apart within a couple of months, these are definitely more comfortable but flawed nonetheless. Both sets sound great in Game, but poorly when streaming video or listening to music (except when you plug them to good sounding mobile devices from Apple and Sony where they just sound amazing). Sony should add a firmware to let the consoles do the sound processing instead of the earphones and have their design team test their durability before sending them into production. Sound quality is okay but not great (lacks low bass that I like), build quality a bit fragile (can't see hinges or plastic frame lasting long), and has a LOT of drop outs (more like a limited randomly kicking in muting the sound for a split second, VERY annoying).But look cool, battery lasts a while, nice settings, and pretty good virtual surround effect.Note: Mic is always there (can mute it but not disable it so always have the mic icon in game)... Great item for ps4 one of the best headsets to use for online gaming. Fast shipping good communication very happy with purchase! Works great the best headset Ive owned, wish the battery life was a little longer but its not bad, just a personal preference. Nice Had a month and they sound and work great! I got this for $50 on sale. Compared to my previous turtle beach headset these are much more comfortable. They last about 4 hours of continuous game play which is and charge pretty quickly.  The sound quality could be better, and there is an occasional random static sound coming from the headset during game play, very rare or perhaps they are starting to break down on me, only time will tell. For the price there really isn't anything else out there for the PS4 that is better than this headset. This product is very nice and the service too. First of all let me say I have the ps4 and xbox1. I love  both of my machines. So for the review of theses great headsets. First $100. These are worth twice that. Awesome sound, wireless and very comfortable.  And no mic that gets in the way. Second...easy to pair. Just plug in the USB plug. Make sure you download the playstation app. I've spent 300 dollars on game head sets and these are up to par with those very good My favorite headphones by far. Super comfortable  for my ears. Headphones are amazing but make sure buttons are on left ear or friends WILL NOT be able to hear you at all. It took me weeks to figure out this was the issue Not too shabby. I misplaced the earpiece for my ps4. People tell me to just plug in iPhone headphones but when I did that the mic didn't appear to be working. Then I used a y-splitter and connected an xlr mic to a USB interface with a live monitor headphone out and used regular headphones. The quality of that setup was probably superior, but the Sony wireless set doesn't have me tangled up in cables. I wish there was a better way to keep it charged, it sucks when you're in a dungeon or battle and the headset beeps to indicate a low battery, and then shortly afterwords you can't communicate with your team. Or when you're hunched awkwardly out on the edge of the couch at the limit of your USB cable trying to be plugged in and using the headset at the same time. From a full charge it lasts a fair amount of time, but it could possibly be a more elegant power solution and allow some external battery or something.The sound for the headset is decent but mic level is problematic. I was playing online and could hear my echo from other players, I held the ps button in like I used to for my jacked in setup and found no mic level adjustment to check how loud I was. I discovered that I could do it from the dashboard if I exited my game, but it couldn't be adjusted mid game. I swear with the jack method I could quickly access and adjust my volume so as to avoid annoying everyone for being that loud guy. hubby like it Well I'm here to say all the overall picture of 4 1/2 stars combined is totally wrong. These headphones are not made well at all. I can speak from experience because both my kids have them and have been through 3 pairs each. The functionality and sound are definitely great.The craftsmanship however here sucks. If you don't treat them like they're made of fine china then they will quickly degrade and break. The real problem is taking them on and off by pulling them outward away from the ears. This is because there is a real weak spot in the sides where the pivot hinge is. The plastic around the steel pins breaks and then it's all over. After buying two replacement pairs I smartened up and bought the replacement plan at Best Buy. Now I bring them back every few months for a new pair. That's the only way to own these. Seriously. I've attached photos to show the nature of the problem. Stay away. Just not worth your hard earned money. My brother really liked this headphones. These thins are great. At roughly 13 feet from the PS4 you start getting crappy sound, but below that, amazing. Rarely connected to ps4 despite many resets.  Had to return. wonderful product works great was a little hard for my step father to set up but tech really isn't his thing so all in all great product Good headset but after 2 years, the bluetooth distance was reduced to approximately 5 feet before disconnecting. Works great! Does exactly what it claims to, keeps the boyfriend happy :) Great build and sound without all that cash out. Easy setup. This headset is very nice for the price...However, if your big on sound quality/audiophile type of person you will want to look elsewhere.The headset fits nicely and is fairly comfortable.  The material on the ear pads doesn't breath the best so the headphones can get quite hot.Virtual Surround Sound -The Virtual Surround Sound feature is disappointing.  Compared to a Turtle Beach or other headset with DTS 7.1 Headphone Surround Sound the sound on these headphones leaves a lot to be desired.  So the VSS is better than nothing, but if your looking to enjoy high quality sound I would look elsewhere.Whats in the Box -Headphones, Carrying Bag, 3.5 mm cable to connect to cell phone, wireless usb dongle, Micro-USB charging cable.Summary -If you can get them for 60 and your not looking for the most features/best sound then I would recommend picking them up.  Also the Wireless dongle works in a PC to allow wireless use.  Finally check out the Playstation App which allows you to upload game specific sound profiles to the headphones through your PS4. The Headset is very comfy and you can wear it for hours on end, but the sound isnt that good. I have 40 dollar turtle beaches and they are one of the best headsets ive ever owned, they are loud, comfy, and have a good mic. However the mic on this headset is CRAP. My friends say what mic do you have, it sucks, or what happened to the other mic you had that was good. I would not recommend this headset for the price Best headphones I've ever bought, went from the Earbud that came with the PS4 to these babies oh yes the sound quality is astonishing battery life is good as well. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED I have been searching for a good wireless headset for the the past two and a half years, and have went through many headsets, ranging from $300-$500.  I have been looking for a quality headset that could be used for games and movies, and had the following features: wireless, quality sound, surround sound, and mic.  The funny thing is that I found everything I needed [for my PS4] for $80.  There is no doubt that the best headphones/headsets are wired stereo cans.  However, having a console setup can get complicating due to wires and the need of a headphone amp if plugging cans via the PS4 controller.  This is where the preference of a wireless headset comes in.Pros:Quality Sound for movies and gamesNo bass distortionHidden micSurround sound (best I've heard for a console; PC users - look into Sennheiser PC 363D)Game/chat volume adjustmentSimplest setup (just plug in USB receiver; no cables needed)WirelessCons:None at this pointThis review is not about saving money, getting the best value, not spending too much money, yada yada.  This is the best headset [for a console] that I have owned to date.  For those of you wondering what other products I have used, please see below.Astro A50's - Sound quality is horrible; I went through 6 devices and 5 of them have been defective.  Don't buy into the hype.Turtle Beach Elite 800 for PS4 - Good features, but the max volume is not loud enough.SteelSeries Wireless H - Great features, decent sound, but bass is distorted.Sony MDRDS6500 - Distorted bass, surround sound is not great.Sennheiser RS 195 - Great cans for movies, but no surround sound, and the enhanced sound modes are too quiet at max volume.Shure SRH1540 - Amazing headphones, just not for consoles as they are wired and have no mic.Sennheiser PC 363D - Hands down, best gaming headset I have ever used for PC. My wife bought this for me a couple of months ago.  After about a month, I noticed that the black plastic on the band was cracked.  Now it has cracked clean through and I have it taped up.  The audio is great and it is holding together for the most part. ONE MONTH THEN THEY BREAK WHAT THE HELL THIS WAS $80 OF JUNK I HAVE TO DUCT TAPE IT CAUSE IT SNAPPED!!!!!!! NOW I HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER HEADSET NOT THIS ONE THOUGH DO NOT BUY AT ALL GET PX4 MAY BE WIRED BUT AT LEAST LASTED ME A WHILE!!!!!! Very comfortable, worth $99. fantastic Works great and got with a great deal from Amazon. I bought these to use when I am awake at night and the wife is sleeping. They work great if you only want to use them a couple hours. They will not last all night. I'm not sure they will even last through a very long film (lord of the rings or godfather types). Battery life is a concern for me, and therefore i generally just use wired ones I had before i got these.", "Great not working they send me a second one it is NOT working.Will just purchase from Microsoft and be done with that.

This is experience writing and not a fable.  I missed the $49.99/year membership fee so I buying this was very exciting for me. was happy to receive, and right  on time. good value I ordered for a friend.  It was the best price to be found on internet.  I would order from seller again. Arrived on time and worked great Good The best deal I have ever gotten. I mean it gave me 12 months of Xbox live so I approve!! Good deal as advertised Perfect and a great price. Will for sure buy from them again. Super fast delivery!Just as described. Card never worked... Thank you! It was delivered and it worked.  I had Xbox for 12 months. Code is not working.  Please activate the card or send me a refund. Worked fine, just an older card where you had to scratch off instead use a QR code. Awesome!

No issues. Thank you! So after i ran out of the 2 week free trial i decided to buy it from here. 20 dollars cheaper is really worth it. My code didnt come as the card but rather the code was typed on a piece of paper and put inside and xbox one game case. Free game case for me so it was pretty cool. Bte be carefull from who you buy it from some people arent so lucky and the code ends up not working. What can I say? It's an Xbox subscription card. It does what it's intended for.", "Best joystick caps I have ever purchased. If your like me and found yourself with the gummies on your PS4 broken and starting to crack look no further. These are the best ones I have found and I have tried a lot of them.  Only one problem is that getting those lil suckers on is time intensive.  What i found best to maximize them was the cut off the old original gummies from the PS4 off (be careful doing this) and put these guys on the now-bare plastic joysticks.  I've used this controller at least 15+ hrs a day sometimes and they still haven't let up.  Great thing is you get 3 pairs so you can give a pair to your friend if he needs em too. Great product.", "Does as it should wonderful thank you we lost ours when we moved This bish shows the new cable then ships the older model BS dont get if looking for new cable., cable was less than store price and worked as good or better", "This is one cool looking custom controller replacement piece. I love it! One thing to consider though, is if you're planning to use one of those attachments for messaging or chatting during games or as a keyboard for Netflix, signing in, etc..., this may serve as an obstacle as it may make it so that the plug doesn't reach the connector. I couldn't get one to work on my controller and I'm sure that's the reason. At any rate, I don't care. My controller looks totally cool and serves every other purpose.If you're looking to upgrade a couple of regular controllers you have lying around, this is one cool, affordable way to do it. I would've given it 5 stars, but the fact that it won't allow for the attachment of the messaging keyboard kinda sucks. Still, it's a cool looking addition and I'm loving that part of it. It did not fit right and in the process the remote is now ruined.", "Great Game! Fast Delivery! MY SON ENJOYS PLAYING THE GAME AND ME MOM ENJOYED THE PRICE.", "Great! one of my favorite games ever.

Son loved it", "goood The skin itself looks very good and was not too difficult to put on except for the top inner screen which felt more delicate than the other parts due to how long and skinny it was.I heard from other reviews that the skin fades after awhile, probably from the sweat of the palms. I use the HORI cover which may help guard against fading since I have not seen any occur.All in all, I like how it looks and how it gives my 3Ds a personalized appearance. Skin looks great. My son loves it.Also this vender went above and beyond for us. I would highly recommend him!", "great Red Steel felt like a cross between a novel and a video game. Which I think, is quite a fascinating idea. Kind of like the Wolf Among Us in that sense. Which I thought was pretty kool. The controls are a bit tough to get the hang of and gives you a workout at times. But once you do master those controls, it is quite fun to play. Storyline is pretty interesting. I would like to see Red Steel continue on the wiiu or nx. I was reminded of the Comic Book Series Lone Wolf and Cub when playing this game.", "good excellent!!!", "Zombie is fun Can't beat it. Arrived on time, intact and as advertised. No complaints. Amazing game for a very affordable price", "This is a great product for helping keep your PS4 cool.  I never had a problem with my system overheating, but that's not to say it is not helpful to have a cooling fan.  Some days I could be grinding Destiny for hours on end, and this will come in hand.  I have it sitting on top of my cabinet and it keeps the PS4 in an upright position perfectly.  It fit the PS4 perfectly, and was an exact fit.  The controllers also go in and fit in perfectly.    There is a slight noise to it, but it is expected, as there is a fan running.  The blue light can get distracting, so you might want to put some electrical tape over it if it is in your line of sight.  The fan comes on automatically when the PS4 is on, and shuts off with the PS4, if you are powering it via the USB port on the PS4.  You can also manually shut if off by pushing the button on the front.    It's well made and does its job.  If you have the space for it, and play a lot, I would recommend investing in one.    *I received this item for free for an unbiased and honest review. This works surprisingly well.", "Absolute s***, never worked once. Right trigger is always held down and makes playing games simply impossible. These controllers are garbage. Just pay the extra money for the japanese Smash Bros controller. controller is exactly what I needed Probably one of the higher end 3rd party controllers  i would give 50 stars if it had a lb button It's pretty meh. Buttons and analog don't have the same feel that the originals did. Feels kinda cheap and flimsy, to be honest. Get an OEM if you can, but this is an OK substitute Just a tip guys but when buying a GameCube controller don't buy it unless it says Nintendo GameCube on it or the smash bros ones that were being made again for super smash bros wii U, don't try and go the cheap route cause I promise you it's not worth it, btw I got the new white super smash bros controller (a Japan exclusive and it's beautiful and it works like its suppose too plus they made the cord longer due to the fact of people having bigger TV's and again don't go to the cheap way cause it's not worth it", "Great =) Previously had fifa 13, I like the gameplay in this one better.

I remember enjoying the original on the Gamecube but the graphics look much better now that they have been remastered. I was roughly 8 years old when the GameCube version of this game came out, and I recall hating it as a child while I loved the N64 versions of Ocarina and Majora's Mask. I couldn't really remember why I disliked this game so much as a kid, so when I bought my Wii U, I decided to give this game a shot.  I love it.  I absolutely love it. The graphics are beautiful and the story is great and I am so sad that I spent so many years disliking this game because, man, was I missing out. I've played every 3D Zelda game to date, and a few others including LBW, ALTTP, and Minish Cap, but Wind Waker ranks in my top 3 of all time (along with Majora and Skyward Sword) now that I've played it through.  If you're considering purchasing this game, then I think you should go for it, especially if you're a Zelda fan. It's so worth it. This is such a gorgeous game, and it is so much fun! Dont hesitate, get it. It what you know and love but better. And if its your first experience with the game its totally worth it. The game it self surrounds you in its beautiful world and it's a must buy for wii U owners. Great game! I loved the GameCube version so I picked this up along with my new system and let me tell younger was the best decision ever!", "I lived the first horizon game it was new and exciting that being said this one is visually spectacular but as others have said it's boring, repetitive and the soundtrack flat out sucks. The Srorm island add on is fun but it also gets old pretty quick. Maybe if they do part 3 they can nail it since the next ps4 and Xbox one are fairly new. My advice would be make it arcade since the Forza series already has simulation to that fan base, in other words pick one hybrids never work because fans on both side will not be happy. Very beautiful game but can get boring and repetitive. Love this game. :D I haven't put it down for the last 10 months. It's just about the perfect racing game.", "I ordered this item for an overseas trip. The reason that I am giving it such a poor review is because I couldn't even use it. I bought the game MLB The Show 15 and was unable to install it without buying an additional Sony memory card. The fact that I couldn't use a non-Sony SD card is unacceptable. Furthermore, the memory on the Vita should be significantly larger. I returned the product right away and would not recommend it to anyone. My seller deserves a 10 out of 5. The Vita is brand new for 125 bucks, no scratches on the screen, minor scratches on back, all functions work, also arrived on time......  perfect and very satisfied. The ps vita 2000 has a lcd screen but it looks so emaculant, it makes a person forget youre actually looking into an lcd screen. Feel comfortable, WiFi on the new vita is much better, lighter, a bit fragile but with good care, you can't go wrong. So much more to say but little time. Good stuff! Great! I love it. Good My Vita arrived ahead of schedule and is absolutely perfect. It even came with a cool hard case that I didn't realize was included. Definitely satisfied.", "Everything is smooth, beautiful, fast, and stunning. Japanese  vision! Great system  if you live in Japan. X and o buttons  are switched  in the menu screen.

The build quality surprised me as it is metal and extremely sturdy. I feel like I could drop this from a second floor window and it would shrug it off. I'm no pro at any fighters and I bought this for MAME, but to me all the buttons feel clicky and satisfying to press. I haven't used any other fight stick before, but the joystick has a little play and isn't stiff when centered. It bothers me but it makes no difference when playing a game and perhaps more expensive sticks do this also but I have no experience with them to compare. I liked it best when using it in combination with my Lik-Sang style PSX-&#62;USB adapter. Maybe I was getting lag from plugging this into a hub, but it just worked better overall with the adapter.Buttons are okay. They respond well enough, but don't have a lot of tactile feedback. The stick has too much play, but simple tape remedies this easily. That's the only mod I've felt the need to do on this joystick: it's otherwise a competent entry-level stick that will keep you in good gaming times for a while. An octagonal restrictor, or at least something better than that dumb plastic washer, wouldn't hurt...I've won records in games like Super Crate Box and Blazblue using this stick, which to me means that it works well and quickly, without introducing any serious lag.You can do a lot better for a lot more money/work, or you can do a lot worse for about the same price. I don't know of any other good mid-/entry-level sticks that are still commonly available. Of those that are, most seem to be for the PS2, so again, if you want this sort of thing for PC gaming, I recommend a USB adapter over whatever firmware is built into these things. It sounds backwards, but the button mappings differ between consoles and the adapter helps with that. Great for what I paid for! has 0 key rollover and is very loud, if you don't leave at least half a second between button presses it will not register them", "this rocked.  It came with absolutely everything I needed (except instructions).  You watch a couple youtube videos and proceed with caution, and you too can be an engineer (or at least feel like one for a day). I wont lie, this took me more than four hours total work time, but I was very deliberate and cautious-- I was really worried about damaging those tiny components.  After doing it, I feel like I could have worked with a heavier hand. The back of the unit comes without the black layer of what appears to be insulation and the front comes without the thin plastic frame you will need if you want the unit to fit as snugly as possible.  Both of these can be removed from the damaged unit with a little steam and a thin blade.  the screen protector they threw in was unnecessary; I spent a lot of time trying to apply it without airbubbles.  ultimately I just didnt use it since there wasnt one on my original anyway. Worked but difficult to install.  For experienced electronic techs only! Worked just fine Replaced my screen in 15 minutes. Works great. Looks good enough for me. No issues.", "wtf!!!! Button mashing goodness when you don't want to really focus on the objective and really just want mindless fun. pretty cool game if you love shonen anime i just wish support characters can be used a playing character &#62;&#60; other than that the game is good and challenging i like that", "This thing is great! I was worried that the constant plugging and unplugging of the USB cable would eventually damage the port on the controller. This solution is perfect -- a small, unobtrusive charging adapter sits on the controller and I just slide my controller down into the charging cradle on the console now. Definitely recommend. great and organize for ps4 user! Good product I hate having wires cluttering up my gaming station and when I found this I knew I had to have it. It's clean and incredible simple. It almost makes you wonder if they could add some sort of wireless charging in the future. The only downside I could find is that when it is charging the Nyko logo lights up. Other than than it's exactly what I was hoping for. Also it comes with removable plastic stickers that go under the charger that help protect your PS4.", "My son happy, I am happy Grand kids love it!", "Very upset with this product.It delivers as promised, yes, however the PS4 system 'sits' very loose and flimsy when mounted. My PS4 fell off the stand when just pulling up my controller which was connected to the systems USB port, and it no longer is working. Not putting the blame entirely on the Ortz stand, but it has lead to me needing to repair my PS4 system after just 2 days of use, due to the very loose docking. Truly regret purchasing this product.P.S. The damage done the system appears to be towards the HDD. It only boots up in Safe Mode, and is unable to perform any actions from there. It cannot Reformat itself or Initialize itself. Damage may be more extensive as well. The PS4 in our house seems to be in near constant use, and one of the problems that I kept having was that the console seemed to get extremely hot from being on all the time.I have noticed that using this stand with the built in cooling fan has really helped with that issue. Now I can put my hand up against the console and it is not hot at all, just slightly warm, which is to be expected for as many hours that it is being used daily.Having the console in the vertical stand also helps free up some space and clear up some of the clutter around the TV, which is nice. The unit charges the controllers quickly and easily as well, so it is nice to always have a freshly charged controller on hand. I received one to review, and everyone here loves it. Constantly charged controllers, and no more overheating problems. Thumbs up from our little gamers! Does the job. Only complaint would be that the power cord/usb isn't very long, so you can't really have the PS4 flat next to it, and still manage to plug it in for the controller charging. We returned it because we are looking for a charging system the can be plugged in to a wall outlet instead of the PS 2 system. Did not like that the controllers could only be charged while they S2 was being used. Really good product and good here the fast thank you! 5 stars If you have a PS4 and looking for a stand for it, this is the one of top choices. I have bought it for my son and he likes it. It helps to organize the station with remote control while it is charging when is in place. I give this 4, just because it is little bit shaky, it would be perfect if they made it more deep for stand location. I recommend it to any PS4 gamer. Keeps my system cool. Overheated my last ps4 due to excessive use. Don't have to worry now. Good works and looks as expected please with it and would recommend to others. Kool stuff. Makes me feel good about my ps4 I bought this stand for the main purpose of cooling my ps4. I do a lot of gaming and my system gets pretty hot with the fan running at full speed most of the time. I was skeptical that this stand would adequately cool my system and I was right, as far as i can tell it doesn't work at all to keeping my system cool. I still have to use a separate fan on my system. Other than that everything works, the controller changing ports work the USB ports work. So if you are looking for a good fan to cool your system look elsewhere. MY SON LOVES IT. HIS PS4 NEVER OVERHEATS ANYMORE AND HE DOES NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR HIS CONTROLLER TO CHARGE ANYMORE. THERE IS ALWAYS ONE IN THE DOCK THAT IS FULLY CHARGED AT ALL TIMES. THANK YOU I LOVE TO REVIEW FOR ALLOWING ME TO GET THIS FOR FREE IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW. MY SON IS VERY HAPPY. The fan blows in air and dust. Youll have to unscrew the fan and reverse the blades so it blows the hot air out I've only had this for 2 months, and it has burned out both of my controllers. Mind you, I had a brand new PS4 That I bought in March, and I use this charging pad for about 3-4 hrs a day because I didn't want to over-work it. My controllers wont charge, the battery on the inside gets very hot. Also the controller icon show up on the system but it doesn't show a battery life, then it'll just cut off. Thank you Ortz for ruining my controllers. This is garbage.  It quit working after 2 months Got this product with a good deal for an exchange of unbiased review. I was very excited to have gotten into the deal because my hubby needed a cooling fan for his ps4. This came on a perfect timing. Inside the box it came with the product but no instructions. Although it's pretty much self explanatory looking at it as to where to USB ports are, charging dock and etc - meaning it's a user friendly product. I like how you can put the ps4 vertically making it space friendly too. The quality is average.  According to my hubby the cooling fan is not doing so well with keeping the ps4 from overheating. We have to keep our entertainment stand open despite of having multiple holes on the back for more ventilation. We think the cooling fan needs improvement, thus the 3 stars for it. Too loud. Not worth it. I will return it. Great value especially considering the other controller docks in this price range. They aren't doubling as vertical stands and USB hubs with built in cooling fans. Only con that isn't worthy enough to deduct a star for is the led light is rather bright. I had to put tape over it to dim it down. (free sample supplied for review purposes)I have had a PS3 break down because of overheating so I was very happy to get this for our PS4.  Honestly if you use your PS4 a lot this is practically an essential accessory to help protect your investment.  The space saving and organizational aspect was also very much appreciated but what really impressed me was how quiet it was and how well the controller charger works.  Well worth the price and very highly recommended. This console stand and charger is exactly what I needed to keep my entertainment system area tidy and clutter free and our PS4 running at optimal performance. The cooling fans are not any louder than the one I have for my laptop and do a great job at keeping my system from getting hot. It's super convenient for having the controllers right where we can find them on the charge station. The blue leds look nice and the stand itself is heavy and durable for being plastic. The price on this is AMAZING considering how well it's working!! I've been using mine about a week and I don't know how I lasted without it. I do wish the ps4 day tighter in the stand but it's not a big deal around my house. I received my stand free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this with my own ps4. I'm so super pleased with this stand! Helped soo much with my ps4 problems before! usb ports not charging my controller while playing. loud fans, do not like having to manually press button to turn on/off prior to playing/turning off system", "excellent pack Fun products and fast delivery. My son loves the Disney Infinity set.", "Seeing how much they want for this remote and then seeing how cheaply it is made makes me want to buy a knock off. It is so brittle that when it falls on the floor, it makes a shattering sound and the battery door and batteries fly all over the living room, and the seam busts open and has to be snapped back together. It does the job but WOW it's probably made for 20 cents. Perfect. Let us stop wearing down our controllers when we only want to watch Netflix", "I wish I could give this game a zero. Horrible playlists, didn't work for the first 6 months and doesn't care about the competitive community at all. Limited maps for halo 2 anniversary ruins this game. Good job 343. sorry about late review been busy very happy with everything Very good collection, my only complain is that I experienced frame rate dips while playing halo 2 anniversary but nothing gamebreaking. Amazing game. This game is OKAY. The multiplayer works pretty well most of the time. I really only have two gripes, and I'm sure if you play this game then you will agree with me.1. Menu for multiplayer - This game has a multiplayer menu that jumbles everything together. I was hoping that you could go to a separate matchmaking lobby for each game - go to a lobby and pick Halo 2 snipers or rumble pit playlist. This is not the case. There is one lobby and the gametypes you can pick are must much more limited - you can pick slayer and that includes Halo 2 and Halo 3 maps. I would have really liked if there would have been a main menu that allowed to select Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3 or Halo 4 and from there went to the same menu you could expect from each respective game. This leads to...2. Controls! - I never thought about it, but the controls changed from Halo 2 to Halo 3 and even to Halo 4. You can't just use the legacy controls for each game. They created a new &#34;Universal&#34; default that just doesn't quite provide the one size fits all that they intended it for. Sure, there are several variations but none of them work well with all of the games (grenade switching..deploying items). I can't believe they don't just let you customize the controls for exactly how you want them. It's not a big deal, just a little annoying.All in all, these aren't two huge issues that should prevent you from getting the game. They, unfortunately, along with the initial poor matchmaking experience, are two common sense things, that prevent this collection from being as great as it should be. as advertised I bought this in January of 2015, it is now August. First off the ONLY reason I've played Halo was for the multiplayer aspect. Multiplayer has never truly worked. Sometimes it takes 20 min to find a game. After waiting it very often boots you from the game 5 minutes later. I am hard wired with an open nat and still cannot get into a game. I wish 343 industries would take some action and fix the multiplayer problem or refund the money for this worthless disc I now own. Grandkids loved it As a man who never played Halo games, having this bundled in the console I bought seemed like a good idea - wrong. Unless you actually played the Halo games when they first came out, you're going to have a bad time with these games.The story will seem incredibly dull and unless you have a friend to help, you may as well just be making yourself mad just to get the achievements for the games.As for the multiplayer, yeah... no. Needs work. I find myself at the lobby screen having the game &#34;Search for player&#34; more often than I am actually playing the game. However, for me, the multiplayer saves this game from one star. There is just something s satisfying about cruisin around in a warthog gunning down people. Really wish it had Reach though.", "my daughter enjoyed the game worked fine Wonderfull arrive fast and work excelent like Great game Awesome and Fun Game.", "Castlevania with a spark of metroid Very Nice Classic!

Has a lot of stuff to do and the missions vary a quite a bit so it doesn't get too boring. Capturing control of bases may be the main game mechanic, but the unlocks you get give you so many different ways to accomplish the goals that it makes up for it getting a little repetitive. Great game, fast two day shipping very impressed. Amazing game and even better if you understand urdu/hindi. Extremely addicting game that has wonderful graphics with lots of gameplay Excellent game! Good This game coming inside without Users manual book. I bought 2 games and both of this games have not manual book in the left side. Played the 2nd and 3rd game but 4 is breathtaking it's beautiful with detail to background a lot more vehicles a lot bigger map weapon choices are a lot better from pervious games and a lot more wildlife. Definitely a game I would recommend. This was an awesome game. Great story, graphics and gameplay. The amount of weapons and area of gameplay is impressive. I loved Far Cry 3 and this was an even better game. I would recommend it to anyone. My son and I both played the game and we both enjoyed it. You can expect at least 80 hours of great game play. I can't wait for Far Cry 5 and beyond. Great series!!!!!  Highly recommended. one of my top 3 favorite games of all time Game showed up early but there was no manual, just the physical disk and case. Was this a mistake? I love this game because good graphic, exciting missions and lovely view and i am sure view reflect Nepal. Good Job UBI Soft. This is my new favorite game. I can't stop playing. Got it here on amazon for  $20. It's like a neverending game that is really really awesome. I totally recommend it.", "Great game. Great Characters. Deep game. My son loves it !!!", "Not sure what some of these reviewers are talking about, my wife got me this game for my b-day and will admit didn't play it until about a week later ( I was hesitant to even take the shrink wrap off ), but after installing it and playing the game I was pretty impressed with not only the graphics both cut scenes AND gameplay but the actual story was pretty engaging. I thought I'd never say that again after COD Modern Warfare, but it's true it's true! Gameplay was fun and almost fresh, almost, I really dug the exo suit abilities kinda like TitanFall minus giant robots but with an actual campaign. Controls are tight and responsive and the voice acting was better than I expected, so good in fact my wife actually sat and watched many of the cut scenes and she almost never does that for any game. To recap an immersive story, some of the best graphics on the Xbox 1, good controls, different abilities different feel thanks to the exo suits, good voice acting. Why then only four stars? well I'm glad you asked...I got through the campaign in about 7-8 hrs...on veteran, not too big of a deal i know cod games are all about the multiplayer but I have always played the main campaign before jumping into an online match and, this was one of the easiest campaigns to get through on veteran that I can remember take it as you will it is what it is. Installation although not really a part of the gameplay itself, It is part of the whole experience. Installation from a disc took ver 3 hours not cool, I realize its a large file almost 50 GBs, but come on over 3 hours really? not for a download but rather a simple installation, C'mon?DISCLAIMER: This review is for the main campaign ONLY not the multiplayer. But I will add my two cents for those of you who trash the matchmaking cause you can't prey on the newer or lesser skilled players so you can bolster your stats are you serious!? are you serious!? shame on you, ya'll need to get a life. If you feel you are that good on ANYTHING in life, challenge yourself against like minded and similarly skilled competitors or opponents and stop bitchin' about not being able to take advantage of the COD skill impaired cause that ain't cool and you look petty and childish (unless of course you ARE a child), in which case I would suggest you put forth all that energy and effort on become a better human being rather that a better COD player, again just my two cents...Game on and prosperlife, challenge yourself against like minded and similarly skilled competitors or opponents and stop bitchin' about not being able to take advantage of the COD skill impaired cause that ain't cool and you look petty and childish (unless of course you ARE a child), in which case I would suggest you put forth all that energy and effort on become a better human being rather that a better COD player, again just my two cents...Game on and prosper \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb exactly good choice Fun game with great graphics. The main story line is interesting too. Online is fun and has many many different styles of play due to the large amount of options, perks, weapon attachments. Was Very Happy with the game, Played thru twice, and Campaign was awesome Good. Got for son great game and graphics. Not crazy about these types of games but grandson was happy.", "Great Game plays great and arrived on time. Amazing and huge world Excellent Good game The game is great. Graphics a excellent I bought this for my son and it arrived fast and my son hasn't stopped playing it. Exceeded my expectations by far. Best game yet in the series. 5stars -a must play.", "Great videogame really amazingAnd fast delivery Excelent! Once you give this game a chance it's very good. Good plot.  Really fun game play with action starting right after video introduction.  Violence is too much--especially for a Tolkien spin off.  Exploding heads seems a bit much to me.  Awesome graphics.  My biggest complaint is waiting for Orc leadership to shift around when there are breaks in the game. One of the best games currently available in ps4.. Wasted my money. Bought into all the hype. Didn't like the controls at all and it was tedious. Nice graphics but that's not enough for me. Absolutely amazing, challenging and ADDICTIVE!!!", "I'm in the exact same boat as others who have rated this item this low or lower. These cracked in one spot and then again in another spot, after I repaired the first crack.  I take extremely good care of my electronics and after about I think I got maybe 7 months out of these, they broke and were useless.  Great sound and comfort with a good mic but build quality as mentioned is laughable. Great product lose of star because of price Same issues as other have posted here. These do not stand up to regular use. I noticed small cracks a few months after purchase and inquired with Sony about warranty. Was told that cracks were due to negligence which is a crock. Im very careful with this headset. Well a moth or so ago the left side right above the hinge broke and just now the right side broke.The sound is great but the build quality is garbage. Too many complaints on the same issue to just be negligence. I expected more from Sony. Don't waste your money as mine broke just like everyone else's.", "Sound is pretty good but there is interference sometimes... My biggest gripe is that it works poorly with re-chargable batteries. This headset is amazing. The sound quality and adjustability are fantastic. Would recommend to all my gamer friends. I ordered this 3 years ago and it still works great! It even works as a surround sound headset on the Xbox 1, but the mic does not work with xbox1. None do unless you buy one for the Xbox1 Great item for the price with good sound. My son got this for his xbox 360. He loves it.", "Would have been great if the level piece wasnt broken. Buzz and Jesse work great and my son loves them We bought these on a lightning deal and was worth the price.  I am glad that the original disney play sets will play on the 2.0 set, so if you spent the money on the first one, no fear it will play on the new one as well. This game is really fun. It has a lot of playable content, and while Jessie and Buzz don't play very differently (more of different skins than completely different characters), the world is pretty darn awesome. So far, it's my favorite of all the disney infinity playsets (and that includes 2.0).", "Excellent for the xl size, it's the right size This case fits my 3DS XL which also has a clear protective case on it perfectly. It also has three little pockets to carry three games with you the case is well made and tough enough to protect your system. I highly recommend this and for the low price you really can't go wrong.", "It came on time and was just what it was supposed to be Wasn't brand new in box, was missing the charging chord and the controller was worn out so your player walks forward by itself sometimes. Very nice machine", "nice pens, work as they should Because these were so cheap I thought they were going to be really crappy and then probably not even fit in the 3DS. Turns out everything was great! I actually found my stylist and then lost it again before these arrived. So in case I do that again I have more for backup. I also enjoy having a blue stylus since my favorite color is blue.These extend easily and contract just as easily. I thought this was unnecessary, but turns out I like to use the stylus more when it's longer. Love it, what else can be said. :) They work for all the ds family.", "I take really good care of my things, only used this controller a handful of times. I plugged it in and it stopped working. Really disappointing to get bad quality items. It's a wired controller so no more batteries, it takes some getting use to because its so light.", "What a waste of money. My boyfriend was so excited to receive this gift, only to be disappointed when he could not get it to work for even one complete song without hard freezing his xbox. No patches helped, nothing helped. Sat in our closet for a year before we threw it in the trash. I am yet another 45 year old man trying to recapture what little youth is left by relearning guitar.  I was never good but that's because I tried to teach myself 30 years ago.  This game (training aid) is really pretty good.  The lessons are easy to follow but hard to master.  The song selection is really pretty decent...I actually went and bought several of the songs I hadn't heard before because they were so good...especially Self Trap by Playground Kings.I should dock it a star because there a few bugs in the lessons and the Guitarcade but I won't because I have so much fun playing.  I don't want to stop.  I have downloaded a few songs (they are NOT cheap) and that has even extended the fun because I now get to play along with The Black Keys Gold on the Ceiling.If you want to learn guitar and don't want to waste money on private tutors early on just getting your fingers callused, this game will get you there and you won't want to stop. 90 days and you can play 1 song I have played all 50 plus the bush pack  at least 3 times. No exp I have 3 songs  77 and the rest 30 to 40. Played 3 hrs a day  28 days no bull this realy works. kick ass game keeps me occupied!", "Super easy to set up, and works great Broke after three weeks... This is a pretty decent cord for plugging your XBox controller into your PC.  It is heavy gauge, sturdy and made well.  It will serve as an excellent connector until the wireless version comes out around Christmas time.", "I bought this for my son as he likes to take his Vita everywhere. So far it is a very good protective case. He puts it in his backpack with various other items, books, t shirts etc.... He even knocked the case off of his nightstand with the Vita in it and nothing happened to the Vita turned right on, works perfectly. I would buy it again, if you are going to pay $200 for a device then you might as well spend a few extra dollars to protect it. I like its,on time good quality", "I give this product 1 star because I'm unable to use it. The band doesn't stretch the way it should  (chest height). I know I have big thighs but not they are not huge either.  So the part in which you put on your thigh to hold the nunchuk didn't fit my thighs. I had to place it on my knee which would fit a small framed person athletic build. Quality and delivery were perfect just not a right fit for someone who is not of athletic build. As expected", "3 months after getting this item the battery stopped working. I've tried all the &#34;tricks&#34; to getting it to work but to no avail. Too bad I can't return it. Great charger. Gets the job done. Received with inner package opened and battery pack missing", "Great value for all the fun games you get.  Great to play with friends and family.  Fun for spectators too. Great I love this game.  A real workout. Hasn't played it but it looks fun. My daughter like it very much", "Very useful, who needs batteries when you have this! Awesome! The only plus to having this is the Lithium Battery, and the 9 foot cable.  Other than that, any phone-charger cable will do the exact same service.  I play with my phone charger plugged into the Controller.  I noticed they tried to patch this recently with the most recent controller update.  All you have to do to get around it is have a set of batteries in the controller, dead or charged, as long as it has batteries in it it should turn on, and get its power from the charger cable. Unlike the Play and Charge Kit for Xbox 360, this has a poor connection (micro USB port). It feels incredibly flimsy. It stopped charging correctly within a few weeks and needed to be plugged in all the time. Now it doesn't charge even if it's plugged in. Complete and utter waste of money. Best quality. Usefully product but the controller should already come with it, even the wiI u game pad controller has a rechargable battery I've had this for about a year and a half. When it works well, there's nothing to complain about, and it usually works well. There have been periods of time where it felt like the battery was not properly holding a charge, and that got very frustrating, but it did not prove to be a lasting problem. There are also times when the battery seems to die out of nowhere (even when fully charged) and the controller needs to be plugged back in to be turned on. When that happens, leaving the controller plugged in for a few minutes seems to do the trick. All in all, there have been some frustrations along the way, but I've owned only this battery for my xbox controller for 18 months. I play several hours almost every day, and this kit has been the only purchase I've ever had to make for my controller. If you don't mind sometimes having the charging cable hanging out (which I find is a minor annoyance but nothing more), this is a very solid product that should cover your needs for a long time. battery life too short, won't keep charge Is what it is My dad uses this for his xbox one controller (obviously) and he loves it. His other one broke and was in horrible condition when he got it from his friend (: so now he doesn't have to scramble around the house looking for batteries all the time.But they get worse and worse after each charge (at least that is what happened with my dad) but he still loves it (: Needed this charger since my battery would only last me for a few weeks. Perfect to have", "It's a great controller, especially for the price. Put it through it's paces with Bayonetta 2, and it works a lot better than the vanilla Wii U Gamepad (I just do not like that controller very much). The build quality is solid, and while upon holding it, the sticks may seem a little stiff and the face buttons a little too... &#34;pushy&#34; (not &#34;clicky&#34; enough?), during gameplay they actually all feel & work perfectly. The only downside is the fault of the Wii U itself, not the controller (you gotta keep the Gamepad on; turning it off means turning off the system).Definitely recommended if you're looking for a good, normal controller for the Wii U and don't want to spend too much. It's definitely better than the Gamepad in feel, and almost as nice as an Xbox 360 or PS4 Dual Shock controller, period. We purchased as an &#34;extra&#34;  Definitely worth the money Worst quality.. Didn't even last 5 weeks... Don't waste your money.. Buy original wii u controller..", "Just as advertised! works great, no problems. My Pikachu brings all the boys to the yard, dang right, my 3ds now holds a charge, this works great for small DSs and Large... *Lala lala  la my games be crazy* I use it repeatedly from day to day and it works perfect. It was exactly what I needed. Does what it needed. I like that the cord was also a pretty decent length as well. Great product, but shipping with I-Parcel was a nightmare. Delivered on time with no apparent damage. Works perfectly. 'Nuff said. Good It's exactly what they said it is.i was very happy with the product it charges my 3ds fast and bought this as a extra 3ds charger. it shipped to me fast, and it keeps my gameboy charged.. What else does it need to do?", "Thank you! Works just as the original. The sensor bar came as ordered and it worked great! works fine exellent", "This should be easy to select TWO players while paying. There is no option of TWO players, which is very strange Awsome", "The Witcher 3 is one of the best games that I have ever played. But first let's start with the major downside: bugs. The game is buggy, with some rare framerate issues, and as of writing this review there is at least one quest that is unfinishable because of a weird bug (Skellige's Most Wanted), but luckily CD Projekt Red is constantly releasing patches so soon the game will be perfect! Besides this though, I do consider this game perfect. The combat is amazing, and extremely fun, and although it is quite difficult in the beginning, it gets easier. I recommend playing on the &#34;Blood and Broken Bones&#34; difficulty. The graphics, although slightly glitchy at times, are beautiful. The world of the Witcher 3 is one of the most beautiful, and expansive that I have ever seen. This is my first Witcher game, and it is easy to get into, although I do recommend reading the books (I'm currently reading Time of Contempt) because not only are they great, but also will make your gameplay experience that much better. Overall, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not only the current best game on the Playstation 4, but also one of the best games ever. Worth the purchase It would be great if I could play it I have it it just won't play looks freaking awesome though it keeps says the disk is readable I don't see how its for the right system Missing the wolf sticker as stated on the box. Definitely worth the money Good entertainment good delivery This game is all I wanted it to be and more Best RPG in a while. Lots to do and discover. Story is amazing and character development is very good. The main problem is that the game is a bit repetitive killing stronger enemies built like the lower ones and I wish the move sets were more varied but overall I still rate this game 5 stars and this is from a first time player of the witcher series but long time gamer of RPG's. Great game. you should try it Excellent gamemuch recommended Word of warning upfront: don't play this game from your couch, stand or sit really, really close to your TV.The Witcher III is even better than I expected, and I expected the world of this game. The graphics are phenomenal - better than anything I have seen in open world adventure games yet. The voice acting is superb, never cringeworthy and the writing is like some of the newer, better fantasy novel (think Abercrombie or Ryan). Music and effects are well chosen, and the storytelling interleaves with the more algorithmic contract missions very well. If I had to pick one attribute, I'd say that the pacing of the story telling and the way it's integrated with the progress of the game makes The Witcher III stand out compared to games like Dragon Age Inquisition.To reiterate my earlier warning - this game for better or worse needs you to be close to the screen - the UX is adapted for that, as are the in-game perspective and graphics. I started playing from the couch and didn't enjoy myself very much until I clued into the distance being a major factor. Beautiful, fun, deep RPG.  I didn't like witcher 1 or 2 very much and it has not been an issue for me playing witcher 3. Reminds me a bit of the recent Dragon Age Origins game in some ways. I recieved the game a day after I was supposed, which may be fine considering the fact that the case didn't seem like it was new. The interior clips were broken, where game notes are supposed to be. Also the game was re packed. It didn't come with the orignal packing. Other then that the game itself is great.", "2nd EDIT: the side plastics are now both broken under normal wear. Jesus....these things are garbage. I still have to pair the recover and headphone about 8x throughout about 4-6 hrs of playing. If your playing multiplayer games it will mess you up. I don't review stuff often, but never bought somthing so &quot;Chinese&quot;EDIT: they now constantly have a problem. It's a problem that was once a week. Now it's all the time. You can play for 30min then the sounds goes completely hay wire. Sounds very very strange and hurts my ears. I had commented on it below. The robotic sounds. Very disappointed. I will never buy anything from turtle beach again they've sold their good name to the Chinese to maximize profits. Shame on them.they disconnect from sound completely and have to be re-paired very often. 2-3 times through 5hrs of playing.Every couple hours they will also sound like a really weird robot electronic sound. Very very strange sounding. Can't play a game at all with it when it does this. Hurts my ears. Again only way to fix is re-pair/sync them, but be prepared to do it often. Not reliable.Max Volume is okay, honestly I think it's 20% lower then my turtle beach X32. And they were as loud as I like anything. These will never hurt your ears on full blast by a long shot. They get loud enough to be okay, but not LOUD.The whole charging thing lol. Yeah they are constantly on when charging. No way to turn that off. Just turning them down is all. So if they are off and you plug them in to charge they will come on and stay on while charging.  Only thing you can do is turn volume down on them. That is a massive engineering mistake. Someone should have their rear end paddeled like a small toddler....then appropriately be fired.The presets are a joke. I mean a real joke. Like the designers were laughing when they saw them being put on a truck and being shipped out. All presets sound very very close tothe same.These are wireless. But holy cow, they suck besides that.If you were to ignore all the negatives (which are way too bad to really ignore... Seriously) they are a 3 out of 5 star headphone.These are cheap Chinese junk. Turtle beach is looking for maximum profits at the consumers expense. It's time to leave turtle beach where they belong. On the curb wearing useless headphones.They used to be pretty good. No more. They are trash.Update...... They just started flashing red and stopped working.... I'm actually not surprised at all. From the sounds of their customer service and warranty, I will be cutting my losses and throwing them away. Right out of the box fail. I wasted $200 on this? Xbox One needs to work on how it connects blue-tooth headsets. It was like hooking up an old VHS deck to a tv. They should really take some notes off of the PS4. All I had to do with it was plug it in. This is a POS!", "If you are thinking of buying this game, please don't be stupid and waste your money and time Not like that previous battlefields. Not worth the money", "The PS3 has never worked correctly. I purchased it while my son was on vacation and he returned after the warranty had run out. He hates it and it was a waste of money. I have purchased PS3's before. I am not sure if this one was refurbished, moded or whatever, but it does not work correctly, so I was out over $300 for all of the items I bought for this system. I am now in the process of having to deal directly with the original manufacturing company. It is a pain. it was a good buy for how much it cost it is great. thank you.", "Fantastic game overall; if the &#34;Sonic Boom&#34; branding scares you, don't let it. This is one of the best Sonic outings in years.Sonic Boom is a GORGEOUS 2.5D entry in the series that pulls it's characters and settings from the Sonic Boom branch of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. That means it's a sidescroller like classic games, but with 3D graphics - think something like Donkey Kong Country Returns if you haven't heard of the term &#34;2.5D&#34; before. The title incorporates elements from a lot of quality sidescrollers - including world map screens similar to various Mario titles, team based gameplay with unique powers like in The Lost Vikings, expansive maps with hidden paths only accessible with specific skills a la Metroid - and meshes them all with quality Sonic gameplay.If you just play through the stages as fast as you can, you'll enjoy a Sonic game with great level designs that's a little less precise than the best games in the series, but has a focus on tricks & special moves to engage instead of asking for precision all the time. With the characters' new &#34;electro whip&#34; thingie, they can now swing from grapple points, and with their individual abilities, all the platforming becomes something special. You'll end up pulling off combos like run &#62; jump &#62; swing &#62; air dash &#62; slam down into a zip boost &#62; grind &#62; bounce pad &#62; swing, etc. So the classic-ness of the gameplay, while a little less fast and a little less precise, is actually a lot more engaging and rewarding to play. The game does bring the speed though, it's just metered out a little better than in previous sidescrollers. The camera is also a lot better and more dynamic, with a nice amount of &#34;lead space&#34; (the distance between the front of your character and the edge of the screen) so you actually have enough time to see obstacles coming and AVOID them. Crazy!The game is a bit of an &#34;adventure&#34; in that you'll need to return to areas with new characters to gain access to different chunks of the levels and collect different doodads. Collecting doodads is important for a few reasons, namely you need them to access new levels (they're locked and require a certain number of emblems - obtained by finishing the stage, finishing it under a certain amount of time, collecting all the crystal shards in the level, etc. - to unlock), and you need blueprints to get Tails to build you upgrades. These upgrades apply to all characters, and include awesome things like destroying enemies by running through them, revealing item locations on the level map, or adding a &#34;Ring Vaccuum&#34; effect to your character so you can grab them by merely getting close to them, instead of having to get through them. A fully powered up character at the end of the game is a big improvement from one at the beginning, so the upgrades are important. Luckily going back into the levels with new characters and using their abilities are really fun. Tails lets you use fans in the level since he can glide, and he also has a toy submarine that lets you access a mini-game to get things too. Knuckles and bust through certain materials and tunnel underground, and Sticks has a boomerang that you can control around in the air - very useful for anything really, but specifically for hitting switches and turning off traps. Our main man Sonic however can air dash, which gives him the ability to reach out of the way areas (&#34;L shaped&#34; moves; air dashing straight up and right, for instance) and bust through blue blocks. You'll see all these &#34;hooks&#34; while making your way through levels, so you're going to WANT to explore further. And with Tails' upgrades, you won't be wandering around aimlessly - you'll see the items on your level map, know where you need to go, and just have to find the way to get there and pick the character who can do it.The levels are really well designed in general, and - like I said before - gorgeous. This is one game where you'll want to crank the 3D up from time to time, because the depth in the game is really nice. There's a great mix of foreground, mid and background objects and the camera's dynamic; the 3D really makes it look like a diorama with it's mix of depth. All the models & textures look great too - this is one of the nicest looking games on 3DS for sure. It all moves at a smooth clip too. All the worlds are very distinct in aesthetic and feel from one another too. All the levels are built to accommodate both speeding through, with a default &#34;middle track&#34; and exploration, with additional &#34;upper and lower tracks&#34;, to every level. So you'll end up exploring above, below and all over your main track on subsequent playthroughs, but it's always off to the side the speedier stuff - it never gets in the way. They're really good level designs that they function so well just racing through or slowing down and taking your time.Sonic Shattered Crystal is super enjoyable once you come to terms with it's little oddities. Namely how progression works (gotta get those emblems!) and the less-precise-than-other-Sonic-sidescrollers controls (well, that's not true. It's better than Sonic 4 Part 1 and the Sonic Rivals games). It's gorgeous, the elements it adds to Sonic gameplay are fresh and welcome, the way it handles team based skills works beautifully, there's loads of content here, and it's just a blast to play. Highly recommended - but you don't even need to take my word for it. There's a demo for Sonic Boom on the 3DS eShop - just give it a play. This game is rad and deserves a purchase if you enjoy quality sidescrollers and Sonic games. Also, be on the lookout for it's sequel coming up this year: Sonic Boom Fire & Ice. It's from the same developers and looks to be as good as this one while adding in more to the formula.Fun fact; the developers of this are Sanzaru Games. They're also the studio that makes Sly Cooper for Sony now (Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time for PS3/Vita is freakin' fantastic as well, I should point out). Sony only deals in quality platformers - just look at Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank or Ape Escape - so when Sega gets the makers of Sly Cooper to make a Sonic game, you would figure it would be good, right? Well it is. It's an absolute - baffling - shame that so many outlets refused to cover this and instead focus on the disaster of the console game.ike I said before - gorgeous.

Bought more than one from this seller and I'm very happy with what I have gotten. No problems. Just get the amiibo as soon as possible Premium product, das falcon is excellent", "Keeps my son busy All good everything as stated", "I used to play Call of Duty and thought this game was a joke, but because it was Nintendo I bought it.  I no longer play Call of Duty.Game of the year 2015 if you ask me. Amazing game! Bought this because gaming with a one year old can be tough.  This allows for nice short battles where I can jump in and jump out quickly.  Lots of depth but doesn't require your soul to play.  I wanted something non violent that I could feel comfortable with her staring at and she bops along to the  music and she loves all of the colors beings splashed about.  So if you're a gamer you shouldn't miss out on this, if you're a new parent you shouldn't miss out on this, and if you're a gamer and a new parent then stop sitting on the fence and just buy it. PLEASE note that this game is not great unless you have internet access. Although I read some reviews prior to purchasing and even talked with some game stores, my son (10) was highly disappointed. Also, when it was in single player mode, it kept glitching and locking him out. We had to get rid of it. This game is awesome My son absolutely loves this game.  I've seen nothing but this game since it came in yesterday.  He has even recorded himself playing it so he can post the movies to Facebook.  He's 10...a great non-violent game for him.  Disclaimer**I paid full price for this product. Splatoon is a charming game with interesting characters. It provides a much needed change of pace in the world of competitive shooters. I was having too much fun with Nintendo\u2019s new ip when it first came out to write any review! So decided to write one now after trying all of the game\u2019s features. Didn\u2019t have any issues with online multiplayer. Octo valley is fun. Love the colors! Vibrant. Gameplay is fun. It\u2019s actually is enjoyable to play. I prefer using wiimote controls to play this game.Transform into a squid when needed. Blast others with ink. Neat idea! Only thing I wish it had more options for single player. I like the notion of identifying with animals in a game which is pretty neat. Nintendo tends to do that with many of it\u2019s games (Zelda, Marios, Donkey Kong, Deep Ocean to name a few). I can play Splatoon with others than me without having to worry about an over saturated amount of violence. I also now have a better appreciation for squids. Feel like painting some wall somewhere with bright colors after playing Splatoon.Try this out:Play Splatoon in your backyard in 480p (some resolutions are still better for certain things) with color saturation settings set to max next to a waterslide when it\u2019s hot out. Works well for me! One of the best shooters ever. Nintendo did it again. You won't regret your purchase. The game is quite fun, when you get even matches.  But the &#34;ranked&#34; matches are not so even either.  On the ranked battles there's always a significant difference in skills for the team (their ranking system is not the best as it doesn't take into account how well you play but how lucky you are to have been on a good team).If a team member gets kicked out (it frequently happens with the Nintendo network but it's getting better) then there's no way for that team to win.  It should give the other team a bonus of some sort to make it a little more fair Great game!  My kids (11 and 7) and I (46) love playing it.  Multiplayer is excellent and very fun - kind of a G-rated version of team FPS games like BlackOps.  Lots of different weapons and level ups to keep gameplay exciting. If you have a Wii U just buy it.I haven't had more fun playing a video game since I first played Super Mario Galaxy. There are already so many great reviews for this game so I really wouldn't be able to say anything that hasn't been already covered. I just wanted to rate the game 5 stars. The online multiplayer is very addicting and is the heart of game. I can honestly say whether I won the match (scoring the most points for my team which has happened quite a few times! ^_^) or lost I always felt like I won as I've had the most fun ever. To all my fellow Splatoon gamers and fans.. Stay Fresh! You're a squid that shoots ink all over the place. I mean, wow.You can literally shoot ink anywhere and swim around the trails you created to get around a level faster.  Why are you still reading this?  Go buy this if you have a Wii-U and start shooting ink all over the place!! Amazing. Worth the price of admission, Seriously fun for old and young. What a fun game.", "Absolutely loved this one. WHAT THE HECK", "I rated this four stars because every now and then it seems to hang up and seems to have conflicts with certain add-ons. Difficult to install on windows 10.  No updates available to my knowledge.  Program exits in mid flight.  Very disturbing.  Watching for updates as of now.", "SCAM! dont try DO NOT TRY THIS&#62;Im so amazed that someone would try to profit off of this.all you have to do is make a new account if you dont have one,then purchase a free subscription on the xbox live website.Then when activated you are then able to turn off auto renuale.", "Better to order online then pick up a third-party nunchuck from a game store\u2014this product has performed just as well as any in-boxed Wii/Wii U standard nunchuck I've gotten, which is to say, flawlessly. Highly recommended as the first stop for replacement Nunchucks, bar none. Great!!! I love that the white nunchuck was still available! Easy to attach to Wiimote. Had to buy since some games require it.", "I have a habit of finding great games years after they've come out and everyone else is over it and this game is no exception. That being said I came to Arkham City backtracking from the disappointment that was Arkham Orgins and this game feels fresh and brand new even though its been out for years. Game play is tough without being unforgiving and the story is really interesting. Im seriously considering buying DLC though thats a little pricey. This game is super glitchy. I had to restart twice when a glitch stuck me in a situation I couldn't get out of.", "This game is amazing got it cheaper than getting it in store :) the package arrived on time Thank You very much I actually really enjoy this game!  I love turn base strategy,  on top of that its not a top view strategy,  it's in a 3rd person view. I highly recommend this game! Oh and if your a prime member the game discounts out to be $19.97.", "I purchased this headset with the intent of using it with my PS4. A USB dongle is provided in box for pairing with the PS4, and it is stated that the mic will pair with other bluetooth devices without the dongle. This mic does in fact pair with the PS4 when the dongle is used, unlike what is stated in the other review.The problem is that the audio quality is terrible. I don't know whether this is due to the dongle doing a bad job at transmitting and receiving audio, or just the headset itself, but the quality is unbearable. The input/recording quality is pretty bad, but almost tolerable. The output/playback quality is potentially worse than what you would hear out of a cassette player that survived a nuclear fallout that's playing at the other end of a noisy tunnel. It's choppy, cuts in and out, and is just plain awful. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this mic.Aside from the garbage audio quality, everything else seems OK. The build quality is decent, and it's generally pretty comfortable. It's a shame, I thought I could finally have a wireless chat headset for my PS4, but this one is a significant downgrade from the default mic provided with the PS4, and I'll be returning it. This item is NOT supported by Sony PS4.  It won't pair up.  See sony forums: http://community.us.playstation.com/t5/PlayStation-General/Bluetooth-Headset-Support-for-the-PS4/td-p/44751616If you try to pair it it just keeps giving you an error message stating &#34;Cannot find a profile supported by the PS4&#34; (see pic).  Despite it saying it works for PS4 on the box, IT DOESN'T.  I emailed Gioteck support and haven't heard back yet, see link:http://www.gioteck.com/support/contact-support/contact-support-usa/Other than not working on PS4 this item itself seems sturdy enough on its own.  I'm sure it would be nice if you use it on other consoles/laptop/mobile.  I believe this issue is due to Sony trying to only sell their products and limiting consumer choice.  However, Gioteck should not market it as PS4 compatible on the box when it isn't either.  I am returning it to buy a Sony approved headset.  While I hate to say it, save yourself time and frustration and just buy stuff made by Sony for the PS4.Don't but this if intending to use on PS4!!! [[ASIN:B00ZTO4OEA Gioteck LP-1 Bluetooth Chat Headset (PS4) - Black]]", "good Great game, quality, accurate description etc The camera controls being put on the d pad as well as the charge functions (c-stick) was an awful decision; most of the time when I'm trying to charge the camera will zoom in and out wildly, causing my pikmin to careen into danger because I can't see anything. Item arrived early than expected which was great because my son was extremely happy to play the game asap.", "There isn't much to say.I've tested with Smash Bros Wii U and multiple wired Gamecube controllers and Wavebirds controllers and all work flawlessly. This functionality should have been included day one with the Wii U, but glad to finally have it. It works like it was intended to work. No problems Works Perfect As Described...But Literally ONLY for Super Smash Bros. Wii (In-Game) My boy loves it I only bought this in hopes that it will skyrocket in value once someone hacks the WII-U. There is no better way to play Smash Bros then with a GC controller.", "Awsome Very Nice Freakin Pac Man", "Works without issue, great not having to worry about memory running out. I love the 64GB, Lets me get the digital only games without worrying about running out of space. Second card I've bought fast a lot of memory above expectations will do business again love it One of the biggest downfalls of Sony and their many mobile devices is that they often try to rely upon their own proprietary media formats. This has almost ALWAYS failed for them and the PlayStation Vita memory card is no exception. Instead of using the widely accepted SD format, Sony created this card for the system. It's very difficult to find these cards at a reasonable price, even for a VERY small amount of memory (microSD cards can be had for very cheap with large amounts of memory). And the fact that the Vita is practically useless without one is beyond frustrating.We can hope that eventually Sony will learn that forcing their own media down the throats of consumers and will use standard formats, but until then you'll be shelling out $80 for a 64GB card like this. 100% compatible, excellent envelope and almost 60 gigabytes which is fair enough. Works perfectly with my Vita in Notth America. I now have two, mainly for all the PS+ games they keep giving out. Highly recommend and wish they would import to the US, 32 gig or less in this day and age is not nearly enough. Price is still very high on these though, so only 4 stars", "Not original controllers, they work ok, but there is a marked difference between the controllers that I have purchased from local stores and these controllers. The case might be original Sony, but the rest of it is knock off garbage. I have had these for about six months and I have to press the PS3 button, then the X button then the triangle button to get it to connect. They also power off if you walk away for more than five minutes. They work, but not at all as described or what I expected. You get what you paid for and I didn't pay much so that's what I got... Needed the extra controller Cool color and works great. Great price too. This has held up to years of use.  My sons love it and still use it for their Playstation.  I use it for the Blu-Ray player. just what I expected!", "Was worried  getting a 3rd party controller but it works like a dream. Hold a charge for a suprisingly long time and arrived early to boot. Will definitely buy more. Awesome! ! The joy sticks do not function properly.. When trying to aim in Call of Duty, it feels and looks like your using a knob from an etch o sketch. Its also advertised as a duel shock 3. But the back says duel shoch III (yes deul shoch)", "Performs as advertised, use with Xbox One Controller Chat Adapter. Works as advertised.  That's all I have to say about that... Like everyone says - lets you use your existing 360 or PS3 headset with your new XBONE or PS4", "works great This product is brilliant. Works just like the Official PS3 controller. The feel is similar, the buttons are really good and it holds charge for very long. Best Controller you can buy for your PS3.Very Satisfied Customer. the controler is great! I had a little trouble with it at first but it's perfect now. thanks xx", "Great. Love it. Works really well Really Nice The controller is okay, the problem is that MOGA isn't keeping up to date with programs that can use this controller. Since Lollipop for Android came out, almost no applications will work with this controller (Grand Theft Auto is a big one). The only exception to this is that most of the emulators (apps to play nintendo games, etc.) will work with this controller still.The controller itself is okay; I wish it had more buttons, but I knew what I was getting. I also like the form factor as it is pretty small. This product runs on two AAAs, and will last a long time.Once again,the main problems with this controller are software based, and I wouldn't recommend you buy this until those problems are addressed. this device does not work with the Nexus 4 if they have the android version 5.1.1, and if they contact the customer only giving advice to take anything useful, games like dead trigger, NOVA, six guns, and other unresponsive control so friends do not waste your money with that bit of trash some of the games that is compatible are not compatible and it does the pivot app needs to upgradefor better game support Works great on 3rd party programs that support it. Syncs fast via bluetooth. Very responsive. Moga Pivot App is required but is free and very non-intrusive. Having your phone in the little cradle thing is optional but not required.However there are 2 things about it that I don't like.1: It takes 2 triple A batteries (not included). However they seem to last quite a while.2: There is no D pad. For games that need just a D pad or both D pad and analog stick this can be an issue. You can map the other analog stick to be a D pad but it doesn't feel right, especially on retro titles.Those 2 issues are small for the price of this controller. It's really nice. I think it's not fair that I can't play my Zelda game because its not on your list. I got this so I can play certain games that I like. But there's no games I like that's on your list While this isn't the most fancy of gaming controllers for your mobile phone, it really does step up the playability of some games if you have a smaller touch screen. The fact stands that this improves your game play for the long haul. My only gripe is the joystick controllers are very close to the controller unit and create this odd feeling of having to push &#34;hard&#34; to move in any direction.NOTE: For those that don't know, it runs off AAA batteries and needs to have an App downloaded to install. Installation is quick and easy, so you know.", "Awesome! Factory sealed and delivered early! What more can I say?", "WOrked Great! Great to hold a slew of games, videos, and music on the Vita. Perfect just as described.  Fast Shipping. Finally upgraded my PS TV from a 8gb to this, still holding on to the 8gb however for additional space.  This works good, of course, I really wanted a 32gb but it was just so much more so I settled for a 16gb for now.  Now a lot of room for all my older digital PSP games.  Only real drawback was the price, of course. very good", "I ordered this for my son's birthday. It came the day before it was to be delivered. He was so excited I let him play it. My son loves it and he can't stop playing it,  It arrived a few days before his birthday so had plenty of time to wrap it.  Thanks for getting it to us quickly", "It's just OK - I use it for MKX on PS4. Here's the scoop:Pros:-Big buttons-Wired-Cross platform (PS3, PS4, PC)Cons:-Trigger buttons are mash-style - this takes a ton of getting used to, especially if your coming from a PS4 pad-Directional buttons are very rigid, un-sensitive - this makes it tough to simply do neutral jumps (You have to press the input considerably harder)Overall it's worth the money, but there is a learning curve and it's not for everybody Works really good, a lot of possibilities for personal configuration, highly recommended. This controller is amazing. I currently play many fighting games. I got this one in particular so that I could play Street Fighter V when it comes out. For now I'll be playing 3rd Strike and Darkstalkers on PSN.Add me if you like: KidFlash613 Overall great controller... The only problem I have is because of the rotating dpad, it tends to shift a lot when playing. This is a great fight pad. It's far better than most. The six button layout is excellent for Street Fighters V. The button size and placement are nice and feels better than the Dualshock 4. There're really only two things I can complain about this pad. 1. No audio port for headphone/mic. Sure you can use one of those Sony's wireless headphone for the PS4. But it would be nice to have an audio/headphone port for some mic options. 2. The D-Pad, the D-Pad is fine and works as well as the DualShock 4 but the fact that it can rotate lead me to believe that it will be a problem later on. And it feels a little flimsy and cheap like it's about to fall off.Overall, I would highly recommend this if you're looking for a fight pad or just doesn't have the money for a fight stick. This is clearly the best fight pad for PS4 and PC currently. Great design and great quality.  Fantastic to have 6 buttons you can press easily.  I've always hated shoulder and triggers for anything other than shooters. Excellent", "The game is fun and a lot of different things to do. Me likey pirating.I'm a completionist and it's hard for me not to do all the side stuff first before going on with the main story. Fun fun. Excellent. Awesome! Some of it was great. Some of it like the Locate James Kidd portion was just horribly boring. Too bad they added that... that part should have been much shorter..Too much sitting and waiting and just wasting time. With that in it this game can't compare to Far Cry, GTA5 or Call of Duty.", "My kids love it.... good Good.  The shipping part took forever I thought they lost my order !!", "So much fun and so addictive I can't stop playing it. A really cute WRPG-Style 3DS game.One of the very few on the 3DS. If you like games like Skyrim i highly recommend this game for your 3DS. This is my new favorite game! I love games that allow you explore and interact with the environment, collect items, and build a character. This game satisfies all of this and more! You can pick the life you want to lead (your job, basically), gain experience, collect items, and satisfy small quests. When you're tired of that, you can select a whole new life for your character and start again while keeping all the skills you learned with your last Life! As you gain more experience or try new Lifes, the way you interact with the game changes so you can do new things and go to new places.I only gave it 4 stars because the actual story line of the game is incredibly lame and boring. BUT, you don't have to follow it much and mostly you can do what you want. Going through the different levels for each Life and gaining experience is a lot of fun and it has a ton of small tasks and quests that I found to be more interesting than the main story line. That's what gives is so much replay value.I highly recommend this to people who like SIM games. Great game very dynamic.  If you are a fan of open world RPGs you will live this game.  My 7yo daughter loves this game, and I also appreciate it at nearly 40.  Reminds me of awesome games I played in my youth on SNES.", "Good Excellent recommend 100% I don't like that you can't use them on the first system.  We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.  Great buy for any family fun or game night. Product as described.", "best game ever!!!!!!!!!! must buy Terrible game, I was expecting all the new features I was seeing and got nothing for my money. This is an EA Microsoft ploy to get people to spend money on a new gaming console. Want all these cool features, you have to go buy a new xbox1. Trash, plus they put the new scouting points accumulation system without the new scouting system, 380 points max for a season and I can never get it over 500, can't even see a prospects overall grade. This is a sinister plot and a big fail in my book for EA. way to push the new gaming systems for Sony and Microsoft. U guys need to stop hating on maddean I have all of them it's a great game Same as last year. Same cut scenes. Same commentary. Same animations. What did they add? Udated the rosters. Changed the menus slightly. Added stupid EA Trax with dumb hip hop/rap songs that no one has ever heard of, while taking away the cool NFL instrumental score. This game should only be $20 for the XBOX 360, since is just a slight upgrade and cut and paste job of last year's effort. Shame on you, EA. I'm returning this for store credit. Gave it one star, but only because Amazon makes you give it at least one. Otherwise, it doesn't deserve any. And this is from a guy who has been playing Madden since it debuted on the Sega Genesis back in the '90's. I get that EA has a tough job in churning out a new game every year. I respect that. But, wow, this is by far the laziest EA has ever been. Virtually NOTHING has changed from last year. BOOOOO!!! i have every madden title released on xbox 360 including madden 16.  This year madden 16 does have new features such as draft champions mode this is on the xbox 360 version.  As far as the new throw and catching options for recieves this year I don't know if madden 16 has this feature where you can have your reciever do different types of catches based on the situation in the game.  On xbox 1 you are able to for xbox 360 I am not sure, this also goes for defense as well I know on xbox 1 you can do different types of catches with your cornerbacks, free safties, ect.  But I am not sure if you can do the same on the xbox 360 version.  But aside from that this years madden on xbox 360 is a great game. Disappointing, Only buy Madden every 2 to 3 years being it the same game...Only played about 10 games in franchise mode and I noticed..1.) Replay still way to short, can only replay the tail end of most plays2.) Same boring cutscenes, like  when the computer calls a penalty.  Way to long, and the same each time.3.) Played S.F. vs BAL, and Phil Simms rambled on about  Harbaugh brothers facing off, while showing S.F. new HC Tomsula.. While still a good game. Its the EXACT same as 15. There are NO new features like the X1 version. Dont waste your money. Just get the X1 if you want to play a new Madden 16. EA never said 360 version was the same as 15 and you NEED the X1 so see all the new changes. But why would they.... -SAME OLD MADDEN- IT SUCKS- IT FREEZES A LOT AND GLITCHES OFTEN- I DON'T THINK THAT THEY INVESTED THE TIME IN THE COPIES FOR PS3 AND XBOX 360 VERSION-THEY JUST GAVE US THE SAME GARBAGE FROM PREVIOUS YEARS-BOOOOO- SHAME ON THE DEVELOPERS- Don't waste your money...it is the same game as Madden 15.  Exact same commentary...and I mean word for word...nothing new.  Same glitches that and some new ones.  Nothing improved as far as XP...I think they added 1 or 2 Traits.You are spending your money on a roster update and the #16 on the cover. EA does it again folks.and by that i mean literally EA does it again.they have made the same game as madden 15 and as madden 25.EA must be too busy working on star wars to which they bought the rights to, to be bothered with making a new madden game.the passing game is literally luck,no skill involved.it's just a crap shoot.and you wont get anywhere rnning unless you use certain running backs,ala adrian perterson.but as long as people keep buying ea sports games they will continue to put up bad games like these.now they will ruin the star wars video game franchise too. The printing on my husbands birthday wrapping/card is barely visible. Printer apparently was out of ink. Can't believe I paid extra for this. Don't have high expectations for the graphics and all that because it's for XBOX360. Good Game, fun to play..everyone else seems to bitch about minor things but it's fun to beat your friends and talk smack! It has good graphics  it has good music it has good player's it's been a pretty good game What a joke! Horrible game. Just like 15 you can't see any attributes in free agency. Makes franchise mode unplayable Just the same as Madden 15 for the Xbox 360. If you got a next gen console great job. Nothing has changed for the 360 consoles nothing. Same commentary same game glitches sideline affects everything.  Sticking to madden 15.", "Bought this controller for my new phone. Learned it has NO support for lollipop OS and was essentially an expensive brick, not that the company will mention that. 1/10, would not purchase again. This is an awesome device. Works flawless for android!! Makes all my compatible games so much more fun and very much console like depending on the quality of the game. A must have for any 1st person shooter or driving game. Should had bought one a long time ago. It would get five stars if there were more games for it. Its worth it. ordered for my husband for his phone. He has a lot of games on his phone that he loves to play and i figured this would be better than using his phone keypad. HE LOVES IT! Great quality Save yourself a headache. While the physical controller itself feels nice and its sturdy, the software and setting up is a nightmare. I have tried setting it up on 3 different android devices (Note 4, Note 5, Tab A), and got it to work once. Then I maybe reset my phone or something and poof, didn't work ever again. The one time I got it to work, there was a noticeable delay which made it annoying to play any game requiring even the slightest timing, like platformers. Maybe I'm not understanding something, but why is it so damn difficult to set this up in the first place? I have tried the Moga app, several emulators, pretty much all settings combinations, nothing. Even games listed IN THE APP do not respond, I had to request refunds for 2 GTA games, Bards Tale, and some others. I spent hours trying to set this up to no avail. Pass on this product.", "microphone stopped working after 2 days. would recommend the sennheiser headset instead. same price but way better sound and quality and build. Setting up shipping was awkward.", "It isn't as impressive as the next gen version but it's still a good time. Received on time. Hours of fun. Bought this for my husband and he has enjoyed playing it. He has beaten it on several different occasions and often goes back to play it again. I think that counts as a hit right?! I don't personally play kill games because they don't peak my interest, but he loves it so that makes me happy!", "Ordered for cousin grandson Excellent! My son loves the Disney Infinity set. My sister-in-law loved this thing and was so surprised when she received it as this one particular Disney Infinity character seems to be the hardest to find in the universe. Perfect just as described.  Fast Shipping.", "The game stays true to what a kirby game should be while adding a wonderful 3D spin Hours of Fun and play time. My daughter LOVED it.", "The plot is awesome, the music is amazing, and the gameplay is fantastic! My only complaint is the lack of feet in the animations. grate runs great, delivered quickly!", "I love the Xbox one it's great. And I'm so proud of myself for only paying 290ish for the console and but then all together 349 with a controller and two games. I'm so satisfied at how inexpensive this item was and it came on time and not damaged at all! Wow what can i say this was such a great buy. I use it as a cable box since i have Verizon Fios and all the channels come in clear. I've played a few games and it's very fun. Only downside i would have to say is that 500GB is too small and fills up fast. That is easily fixed by attaching a usb HD. For parents it is awful. It takes forever to get ges to start. There are multiple logins and downloads and we are never sure what account we need to log into and what password is required. Sometimes it simply doesn't work and you try everything and finally reboot it several times. With anxious kids excited to play any game this is torture and we often end up playing the Wii or Gamecube because the older systems just work. I love Xbox One, they give you the gold subscription for free during one month, where you can download more free games. Halo collection is awesome, is heavy to download but the console keeps downloading the games while it is off I got this as a birthday present from my boyfriend. But playing it alone is quite boring. Please come home quickly honey. Great! son loves it I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, current and upcoming (November 12, 2015), shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spaciousand cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack and shouldn\u2019t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven\u2019t included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller isn't yet available, but will retail for $150 (about triple the price of a regular controller). If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.  Current bundles -  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating.  Legacy bundles-  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4.  Hope you found this comparison useful. I have had this product for a few months now and have only been able to play it for one of those months. The system now refuses to power on. I have talked to many people from the repair center who keep attempting to help register our device to scheduled a repair, but nobody seems able to do this. We have tried multiple time to register it on our end but keep coming up with &#34;this action can not be completed at this time.&#34; I am trying yet again to get this fixed... wish me luck... I really liked that this came with the extra controller and games even though I didn't need the games that came with it. Good deal! Xbox works great! Loves Master Chief!! it is typical microsoft customer care, or lack there of. How hard is it to actually take care of your customers? We spend hundreds on a device from you, and you do everything to avoid helping your customers out. I can promise you that this will be the first, only, and last device I buy from microsoft.I have owned the XB1 for about 4 months.  Starting about a month ago, my controller started to not sync with my xbox.  I did all the troubleshooting MS and youtube could come up with, and it worked for a bit, but as the problem got worse and worse, I requested an exchange of the controller.  Keep in mind I have been in contact with the company since the start of the issue, within the 90 day warranty they set for all accessories that ships with the console.  They did everything to push me out past the 90 day warranty with troubleshooting that they now refuse to replace my controller.  I now have a $400 brick.  Yay me.  If you want a device backed with great customer service, avoid the xbox one.  MS does not know how to support its customers in any semblance of a good way. Awesome!! Good", "While Infinity 3.0 improves upon 2.0 in a number of ways: somewhat shorter load times (though still often close to 2 minutes long), better (though far from perfect) control of vehicles, the inclusion of Star Wars and loads of other content, there are some borderline game-breaking issues, some of which are inexcusable holdovers from 2.0.  Oh, and way too much Jar Jar Binks...If you don't want to read the full review, here's the executive summary:  1) You cannot play the play sets on line; 2) If you play split screen, player 2 will not earn in-game currency, will not earn achievements, will not unlock any of the toys or sidekicks, and will not level up their figure for when they go back to solo play; 3) The system of sharing of figures (i.e., between family members) is so convoluted that I've yet to find an explanation on Disney's site that is understandable; 4) This game is plagued with so many bugs/glitches that it's hard to play a session without encountering one.  The one I experience almost every time I play is the sound effects cutting out, but not the music, often requiring a restart of the game.Now the longer review...First, like Infinity 2.0, my son and I are unable to join each other's game via Xbox Live.  The invitee always gets dropped to the dashboard.  I went back and forth with Disney support on this with 2.0 and they told me that they were aware of the issue in 2.0 but that I should be confident that it would be fixed by 3.0.  It was not.  This game crashing also occurs in the Flynn's Arcade portion of the game and I've seen other users on Infinity forums say they also have this issue.  It seems to be an issue with both the router/modem used by Comcast and the one used by AT&T U-Verse.The really sad thing is that even if we were able to connect, we wouldn't be able to play the campaign / play sets together over Xbox Live anyway.  Yep, you read that right -- the story mode &#34;play sets&#34;, like the Star Wars campaign that comes with this game, cannot be played over Xbox Live.  If you want to play with a friend, you have to play split screen.  I'm not sure if the upcoming expansions for Toybox Takeover and Toybox Speedway will support online play or only split screen.So we play it split screen -- which brings us to our next issues.  Whoever is playing as the 2nd player does not get any credit for the sparks (the game's currency for purchasing items in the toybox mode) he collects.  My son had 307 sparks when he and I started a session, and though it read over 4000 after we played a few missions, it was back to 307 when he fired up a single player session.  Worse than this, though, is that he didn't get any of his character leveling progress.  Also, player 2 cannot earn achievements in split screen.  Oh, and any toys or sidekicks that either player in split screen unlocks only go to player 1.  Player 2 is relegated to &#34;tag along&#34; status.Why on earth would anyone want to play as player 2 if they aren't going to get in game currency, toys or have their character level up?!?For a game that clearly seems to have a community and family focus, the inability to get a multiplayer game to function properly baffles me.  Furthermore, as a game clearly geared toward kids (and kids at heart), there are some enormously frustrating platforming portions of this game.  My 15 year old son, who is no slouch at gaming, said, &#34;I have no idea how Disney expects an 8 year old to be able to complete this&#34; during one mission where we both died so many times we were ready to give up.Also, if you are annoyed by Jar Jar Binks -- and who in their right mind isn't? -- there's about 20 minutes of the Twilight of the Republic play set that will have you ready to throw your controller at the screen.  I truly cannot fathom why Disney would interject such a huge dose of Jar Jar into this game.  It is worse than the movies.  Seriously.If Disney fixes the multiplayer issues and cleans up the numerous bugs, this turns into a solid 5-star game for me.  Really, there is such an amazing amount of content and creativity in this game, it's a shame to see it hobbled by the issues above.  That's what makes all of this so sad -- this game truly has the potential to be absolutely amazing, but instead it just leaves me shaking my head in disappointment.I will say that Disney's tech support, despite being unable to solve my son's and my inability to play a game over Xbox Live, have been very pleasant and prompt in replying to me.  Unfortunately, I've about hit my frustration threshold with this game and am ready to throw in the towel.r />If Disney fixes the multiplayer issues and cleans up the numerous bugs, this turns into a solid 5-star game for me.

I have never played Disney Infinity 1.0 or 2.0 so I am basing this on my experience with 3.0 so far. First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do. Also, watch out because this game gets incredibly expensive really quickly. While all of the new characters look cool, I suggest you check to make sure the character is also good in game since some of them don't have great abilities nor skill trees.", "I have never played Disney Infinity 1.0 or 2.0 so I am basing this on my experience with 3.0 so far.

This game is getting quite big and if you want to build bigger worlds and enjoy smoother gameplay then get it when you get a next gen console. This upcoming black friday would be a great time since this game would probably drop a lot and so will consoles. Bought the starter pack for the PS3 from a local retailer today but had to immediately return it.  There appeared to be a software glitch that prevented the base from being recognized when it was plugged into the console; you could only play the little intro game that comes up when you first load the disk.  It's the exact same base that ships with the 2.0 so I tested the base with the 2.0 disk and figures, and it worked.  Waiting to see if this is a widespread problem before I buy it again.", "Great case! It fits my older model 3DS XL perfectly. It's holds 8 game cartridges and has a loop for an extra stylus. I wouldn't bother going to Gamestop or Walmart/Target. They only sell the Nintendo brand or random cases that are huge. I am so happy when I got the case, it is so nice! I don't know how to describe it, but I think if you buy it for DS, you will know how good it is. You DS need to have a case to save it like this! perfect fit. comfortable grip. very happy with this product This is a good product for the value. Does a great job protecting the 3ds. I have the New 3DS and it fits just fine. The zipper doesn't work very smoothly, but that is only a minor complaint.", "Works great I've always used the standard headset that came with all my systems I've purchased so when I received these reasonably price headset I was blown away by the sound coming from these badboys! outstanding bass and highs and the voice monitoring is what sealed the deal. This is a must have for an entry level headset if you're not wanting to spend too much but want top notch quality. This is the headset to buy.Hooks to controller.  No other cables.  Independent controls for in-game talk, mic volume, and sound from your game.Very importantly these have a &#34;monitor&#34; function so you hear yourself talking over the headset.After going through 5 or 6 of the cheapo Microsoft single-ear headset/mic devices, which have fragile internal wires and break after about a month, I switched to these.  My kids love them. These are quality headphones. The sound quality is not the greatest like you would get with three hundred dollar headphones, but the mic quality is just as good as their expensive brothers. This is a great purchase if you are not a serious gamer. They will become uncomfortable after a few hours. This headset is amazing. Sound is really astonishing, the only thing that stinks is if your a heavy gamer you will go through disposable batteries. Other than that you can't go wrong with this product Great headset. Item as described,would do repeat business. A+!!! It works.", "A great game to play with a group of friends or a significant other. A great portal for laughs and fun parties. Great game to play with friends and even by yourself, don't be fooled by this game coming free with many consoles, it's worth the buy", "Friends enjoy this! A must have for anyone classic Mario play with new school spin and new suits. shaped my childhood and provides good adult fun. so glad I bought it used.  a great way for us to enjoy our evenings Fun for the whole family It was perfect", "so so Product as described. as adevertised and a great price", "EXCELENT!!!! Great. A+", "Good I don't like that you can't use them on the first system.  We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.  Great buy for any family fun or game night.", "First 3.0 figure I got because it was so detailed and looked great when I saw it at the store. Yoda looks like he is in mid action and is great if you just want it for the toy for the sake of collecting. For Disney Infinity players, the character is fast, cool, and has a good enough skill tree but not as powerful as some of the other Jedi figures. So excited! he's fantastic!!!!!!", "I couldn't possibly recommend this game any more.  I am a big fan of Final Fantasy but have missed the last few because I'm not going to keep buying new systems when that's the only game I want.  I love my 3DS, though, and wished FF was available for it.  Well, this is a game totally like the FF series and could easily be called one if they wanted to.  And, I've gotta say that if it was FF, it would be the best ever.  And, since it's not, I guess that kind of makes it better than all of them. Job system is great, characters are great, replaying the same bosses 4x is not great. Way to good Good", "Lovely game. Easier to play than the board. No pieces to pick up after someone gets mad Nothing fancy here and the rules they allow you to change are neither all encompassing nor nearly flexible enough to make the game the way we used to play it way back in the day. Got my first monopoly board in 1951 and never stopped playing.", "excellent Everything fine, nice & useful as expected & good delivery service...", "good A great open world experience with lots to do and a lot of hunting. The story is amazing and the characters are stunning. good game if your a fan of the series", "Fun Kids loved the game.", "The framerate, graphics, and lighting effects are improved greatly but it's still not good. It goes to show that DS2 is inheritly bad. A massive disappointment and a disgrace to the Souls series. As I have become a masochistic fan of the ever punitive but playable Souls franchise, I have to say, I liked Dark Souls 2, main campaign, extra content and all, but as I have been replaying this\u00a0version one generation later, I understand that the PS3 counterpart could have been better in many respects.Well, they made it better. The problem with DS2 on last generation hardware was that they were hitting the ceiling in terms of what they could do to top the original Dark Souls from simple animations to challenges. This PS4 port...well, port would be an insulting term--blows away its last gen counterpart. If it's your first time playing, you're in for danger. If you're a last gen vet, take all your pre-existing knowledge of each\u00a0area and chuck it in the garbage. The enemy placement has been remixed and rebalanced. I feel that's a great bonus to the vets because the experience is still going to be grueling and fresh. Environmental details are vastly improved. Light shines bright, fog and mist are impenetrable, and darkness is oppressive. You can make out the careful detail of the Tseldora Cove spiders, Alonne knights are more ninja like in their ambushes and appearances. The dark orb hurling giants of Harvest Valley can now target you upwardly on the cliff at the beginning, so be more tactful on the arrow sniping.From Software did a wonderful job and I view this as the true vision of Dark Souls 2 made real. If youre a souls fan you will love this game. Looks better, runs smoother and new enemies in locations throught the game. Praise the sun Fantastic game. I am absolutely enthralled with it on my second playthrough. The openness and development of your character is incredible. This might be my favorite game ever. It's dark souls 2, but remixed and includes all the dlc. Looks great, plays smooth. No complaints. Scholar of the First Sin is a worthy addition to your library if you haven't played Dark Souls 2 for the PS3/360. I bought it new after playing DS2 on the X360; therefore, the game is not as exciting as it first was. I wanted the DLC and to see how it would look on the PS4.Anyway, Scholar's biggest improvements are its fast load times (less than six seconds), smooth frame rate, and ability of the PS4 to handle every lighting and texture effect easily. The game is more stable than the original DS2. No texture pop-ins or muddy lighting or network issues. When you click on bloodstains, the phantom players springs up instantly. For those seeking extra challenge Scholar populates areas with more enemies. Heide knights aplenty await you at Heide's Tower of Flame. Graphically the game looks like a high end PS3/360 game, so if you're hoping this version will be a big visual overhaul, you'll be disappointed. (Bloodborne shows you what a real PS4 title looks like.)I recommend buying Scholar at $29.99, not at its present $39.99 price. The game it's based on is over a year old and has aged. I don't regard products like this as games. Games are fun. As I see it, this is a torture device posing as a game. I would have enjoyed it if there had been an optional difficulty level tailored to my admittedly average reflexes, but I'm not interested in spending hundreds of hours becoming more and more frustrated when what I need from a game is enjoyment. It's a bad game that only caters to folks who spend way too much time honing their reflexes to almost superhuman levels. I have a life - I don't have time for this nonsense.Sorry, fans, but I'm just tired of developers ignoring folks like me when it comes to top tier titles. I want to play too, but apparently Bandai isn't interested in opening up their game to a wider audience by including options for those of us who aren't interested in (and just don't have time for) a challenge of this magnitude. After all, it's not as if the elite gamers would be forced to play the game on easy difficulty - they could still go for their challenge all they want.The challenge and the sense of achievement that some say this game gives are just not worth the aggravation for me: it's just a game and beating it is not that important. I have better things to do with my time.", "Awesome! Package came a little burned by the sun, or just because it was storaged, but it works well. Works just how I wanted it to. Best part is that it's 9ft long and makes it easier for me to play not so close to the screen No more buying batteries every week.I am happy. Charged, used one and cannot get it to charge again. Suspect this product sat on the shelf for a long time. Very disappointed. The cheapest way to get a genuine Microsoft battery. This is important since most of the aftermarket batteries are junk. LOVE IT great The wireless needs work, but the plug in USB works great. If your like me and hate spending money on batteries then this is a good investment. I had no issues with the pack or the cable and they seem to work as the ought to. Good buy for those gamers who play for hours and not having to hit the road at 2am to hunt batteries. NO more I say!", "This mini skylander came in perfect condition. New in package. And super adorable. The 5-year-old is really IN to Skylanders.  I can barely make a call with my Smartphone, while my little fellow set up the WiFi and had this tiny toy activated in no time.  The Trap Team's Mini Power Punch Pets, Vack, is just one of the series available, and it seems you can't have to many characters, insofar as kiddoes are concerned.  For the hot mid-day hours of summer, Vack and his ilk keep kiddoes busy!", "Product arrived with a broken screen. :-( I understand it was used, but come on! I figured out was too good to be true, and I was right. Very disappointing though... Very happy with purchase", "I loved this game so much that I had to pick up a physical copy. Unfortunately the saved data does not carry over so I will have to play the game over again but I don't mind. great game, i would like if they make new one but whatever. the gamepley in this game is amazing", "having 10 feet of cable is awesome. Great Good cable just doesn't work well on ps4 unless I'm playing something broke real soon I love that I can sit very far from the TV, but I have had to buy 4 of these(because there inexpensive) because they keep breaking.", "I got broken the game! I do not recommend! Great game I enjoy playing it. Game is a little hard with all the different moves but maybe it is because I am getting old and not up with the times.", "Excellent It wa a great, my grandson loved it.", "Works great Black not blue very disappointed in this i was looking forward to having the same cable i had when i was a kid none the less the cable came in about 6 days and works well.", "fun game. the campaign is basically just playing different multiplayer options, which was pretty disappointing. can't play offline either since the whole thing is multiplayer. it is fun though. Great games my son loves it Good game but not much replayability. You have to grind and repeat the same thing over and over to &#34;rank up.&#34; Which makes it frustrating. What if I enjoy the final weapon but can't ever use it because I have to keep resetting my level... Great game", "Works fine, but is MUCH shorter than the OEM cable. I bought thinking it would reach my couch, but it doesn't. It works and seems to be official Microsoft  product.It is exactly what it said it was. It works for &#34;play&#34;, but seem not &#34;charge&#34; the device / controller. Does not work Barely works. Have to wiggle both ends constantly to get it to recognize and power controller. Tried it on 5 different controller that are all functional. Just what we needed. Sometimes tech accessories are iffy but this works great! It charges the controller and also helps play when plugged. Recommend!", "I've owned a version of this game every year since its inception.  To this old man, the in-game controls are getting way too complicated.  That said, I was able to play the game ONCE, and then a technical issue arose where the game got hung up in &#34;Loading roster-official...&#34; in the startup.  It will not progress any further and of this writing EA does not have a fix or patch and no timetable for when it will be fixed.  Really EA?!?!  I've attached a screenshot of my online chat with EA's support.  Shameful.Anyways, I miss the Madden of a few years back when it was a fun game and not a convoluted mess of various catches, coverages and blocks.  I understand many people here probably love these new features and evolution of the game, but not this longtime Madden fan. Madden 16 is the hot girl who's dumb as a box of rocks and has the depth of a puddle. This game is just awesome\ud83d\ude00 The players look great and the graphics are amazing I have been playing Madden since MADDEN '98. This is definitely one of the best Madden NFL games to date. And the best to hit Next-Gen consoles. New mechanics, Enhanced graphics, great game modes like Draft Champions, Ultimate Team, etc. If you like football, then look no further. This is THE Madden to get. Let me first say that after having played madden 15 which was a very discouraging undertaking on many levels, I cancelled my pre-order for 16!However, wanting to play football, I said to myself, well let's see what happens with 16!.For some reason, it seems sacrilegious for EA sports to give us the consumers who purchase its sports games a blessing without adding a curse!Don't get me wrong, I like what they have done to Madden 16! I just don't like the way they did it.The running game is an impossibility with the exception of a few plays that actually work because within the new animations, the offense moves at an almost snails pace in play action which allows the defense to pounce before the quarterback can hand the ball off. In addition, the defense on running plays lives in the backfield because the block is very stagnant and doesn't resemble they way the pros run block from an offensive line point of view.  With regards to passing, it's actually fun, however, if the receiver doesn't catch the ball after you have gone for the aggressive catch, there will be most like an interception. If you somehow overthrow a wide open target, there will be most likely an interception. When I play games against the computer as I have been lately using the Seahawks against the Chargers on All Madden Level I have been getting beat almost everytime because the offensive line blocking doesn't hold up. My QB has gotten sacked consecutively so fast  at the snap of the ball  that it happens within the blink of an eye and leaves me asking what just happened! Rarely does this happen in professional football in this manner!One other thing that I wish EA would change. Football is a natural game played in natural way. This game is not fully natural the way shooting games are. I don't like the fact that the QB is sacked when a defender is with 5-7 yards. The QB, it seems cannot complete the natural throwing motion which you and I would be able to do in similar situations! The QB has to have a throwing radius of 180 degrees. EA falls short in this aspect because it allows the position of the defenders to dictate the accuracy of the throw!Lastly, there are three things to look forward to in this addition of Madden;1.Exhilarating long distance catches...the QB can actually throw the ball above defenders...(hope they never stop this feature)2. More interceptions because of the new wr/db interactions3. More sacks because the O-line blocking should have been better!Finally!, there is still room for improvement and it looks like EA is on the right track with this addition of Madden.The question is, how long will it be before we get a simulated football game that can do everything? Don't listen to these blind sheep madden fanboys. This is the worst madden I have played, and I severely regret paying 60 dollars for this. Here are some things I dislike after playing several games.1) Nantz and Simms are back for more stale recycled commentary. Love the use of pronouns when announcing. Or generic position names. Other game commentary (like NBA2k) is so much better than this, cmon EA2) Holy glitches and bugs. Connected franchise has frozen or disconnected in the middle of a game several times. Announcers comment over and over how an injured player has returned (literally every play). Also google &#34;Ghost interception&#34;. Do they even test this game?3) New catch styles are dumb. Aggressive catch is so unrealistic and OP.4) If you are a QB in Connected franchise, you have to play on Zoom camera which is awful. Thanks for taking away the customization EA.5) New throwing mechanics are awful. My 80 qb cannot hit wide open guys. Using the left stick for placement is useless and the new buttons for throwing high and low are quite counterintuitive6) Fantasy draft was so dumb. Jamaal Charles, a top 5 rb, went in the 5th round.7) The bubbles that pop up saying for example &#34;20 yard return&#34; look so bad.Maybe this game will grow on me, and I will updated accordingly, but this game is just not a fun time to play. Save your money for NBA2k when it comes out Load times are INSANE!  Gonna have to turn the game on and take a shower then it might be ready.  5 mins to start up.  No lie.  This is 2015 smh. Madden 16 promised big things since info started being revealed back in May.  The question was:  would it live up to the hype.  The answer is far and away YES.  Most likely the greatest football game ever made.  If you like football and know real life football strategy, this is the game for you.WR/DB interactions were one of the big selling points this year and it delivered.  Seeing the animations play out between a WR and DB is a thing of beauty.  Once you learn the controls you realize that player ratings certainly okay a huge factor in how the animations play out.  If your opponent has a big time receiver you had better use bracket coverage or else you will get smoked.  While you would think this would favor the offense, using solid defensive techniques leads to locking down the receivers far more often then not.The running game is also much improved and is easily the best running game released in a video game.  Following your blocks and cutting at the right time is crucial.In CFM, the new in game dynamic goals are very well done and follow along with what's happening in the game.While there are a few bugs to be ironed out, this game is very good.  I say an 8.5/10 but if they iron out some issues then it's easily a 9/10 I was initially frustrated that we could no longer play a career as a legend but draft champions changed my mind!  Instead of having to labor through lengthy seasons you play 3 minute games and after 3 straight wins you are in the championship.  You are guaranteed having one hall of fame caliber player as well.  I drafted Bruce Smith yesterday.  Not sure why people claim 2k would do this better? It's the best ever Madden NFL 16 is not a roster upgrade this year and that's for sure. The gameplay has been massively improved and the new WR/DB interactions make the game more realistic than ever.Being the Playmaker is totally in your hands. The QB you can throw passes in a number of ways such as Touch, High point, and Low Point. New WR mechanics such as Aggressive Catch, RAC catch, and Possession catch allow you to be in control of your WRs. Your user skills on defense will be tested more than ever this year.The new mode Draft Champions brings Fantasy Football into Madden. The mode can be played solo versus the computer or multiplayer vs other competitors. You will go through a 15 round draft to improve off of your base team. The more you play, the more you learn that some Gold players are better for you than some Elite players. You always be able to draft an NFL Legend in the final round of the draft such as Herman Moore, LaDainian Tomlinson, Ray Lewis, John Elway, Jason Taylor, Ty Law, and many more! Wins will be rewarded with content in Madden Ultimate Team. If you lose, you can begin the whole draft process over again. See if you have what it takes to be a Draft Champion.Madden Ultimate Team has also improved. The Journey is a chain of 100+ games and each one is a game-changing moment from a real NFL game. The Journey starts with Super Bowl XLIX and you are the Seahawks on the Patriots 2-yard line trying to rewrite History. This is just one example of the many you will face on The Journey. With all the programs, new challenges, and new legends - there is no better time to try Madden Ultimate Team.If you liked Madden 15 than you will love Madden 16. It provides a fantastic experience all around and is not the same game with a roster update I have been playing madden forever , this is the best one I've ever played  . Congrats team madden you finally nailed it . Madden NFL 16 is back and better than ever! Gameplay has improved with the addition of a new Passing and Catching Mechanic.  Being able to control what type of catch your player makes is a great gameplay addition--we have wanted this for several years! Being able to throw passes in a number of ways (touch, bullet, high, lob, and low) is a great feature.  Updates to CFM includes the ability to practice with your team--another feature the community wanted. I have to give the game high marks this year, despite a number of bugs present in the game at launch, which is disappointing. The actual in game play is amazing, the best Madden has ever been!  They really went all out fixing in game mechanics here, the fight for the ball while it's in the air feature is amazing, and unlike Maddens of the past, this one actually got the defense right! No longer can a rated 70 tackle block a rated 90's defensive end perfectly, or an offensive line block for ten seconds every play (it happens, but like in real life, it doesn't happen often), meaning you have to keep a tight end or a halfback in to block if your line isn't very good. The entire physics of the game is just amazing, and it takes strategy to win a game, not just chucking the ball on a post route every other play to get massive yards, the defense will stop things you do often, like in real life they adjust as the game goes on. The offense also has a few new pocket and qb features that make things feel much more real. 5 stars for that.  Now onto why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Franchise mode is pretty much how it was last year but with a new face. However I will say the new drafting method (which include combine numbers) is cool, as well is the player progression, no longer can a rated 69 guy jump to the 90's in one season. Also, there is no defensive assignments which is out right ridiculous! It makes playing online horrible cause people just put their best receivers on my linebackers, where as if you had defensive assignments, you could put and keep your best corner on their best receiver all game. Great game!  Graphics are Amazing Fast delivery!  Item as advertised. Wish I could do 4.5 stars.For a madden release it is very smooth. I've not encountered any bugs yet.I really have appreciated the upgraded passing game, the reworked blocking and tackling as well.I'm also slightly obsessed with the new draft champions mode!Also simming with a connected franchise is now 10 faster! You can Sim an entire fantasy draft in just  a few minutes. Last year it would probably take you 15 minutes or more.I also have noticed that the graphics are even cleaner than last yeae. Often madden feels fake to me, especially compared to the ncaa series of old. This year it looks and feels clean and fresh! Had 10 hours to paly this bad boy before the release today so I thought I'd give my two cents. First of all, I usually go with ps4 games, but I couldn't resist having the ability to play it for 10 horus before release with EA access. EA access basically lets' you play games early, which is a good thing. And I have to say I'm very pleased with the XBONE Version of Madden.Madden took years to come to form. I've played it since it's first arrival on the beloved Sega Genesis and look what we got now?  It's had a rocky road here and there, and  I understand it's been under heat for being too much like the previous years game, but no worries, they give you just enough to make it feel new.Madden 16 is the first game to utilize penalties to their potential. We finally have them and they work! Pass interference calls? Yep sure are. Holding? Yep. Defensive holding? Sure thing. Late hits penalty calls? You bet!  This makes the game feel more like a real game.  I haven't decided if they're over done yet, but so far, it's pretty standard on what you see in a real game.  It really adds to the realism if you're into the more simulation aspects. It still has the classic controls of Madden.  Truck stick, hit stick, spin move, hurdle, juke, etc.... Long time madden fans will be right at home with it. The newest things are the aggressive catch and possession catch functions. The aggressive catch can make for a amazing eye candy that you have never seen in a football game before, it's so real people walking into the room are thinking they're seeing ESPN highlights. With aggressive catch activated with *Y* on the XBONE you can make for some spectacular catches and they look spectacular on both sides of the ball. Defensive will also make some amazing attempts to gain possession. Defense can do the same thing, so it's kind of a crapshoot what happens depending if they go up for the aggressive catch. You can make some mistakesif you get hit using the aggressive too much and interceptions can be more gracious. I do like the new function, but as with anything, including the penalties, if you don't like them, turn them off.The game feel more organic than ever. 15 was great IMO already. Sure, you get the occasional times where guys flop around on piles and play possum on the field till they want to get up. Yeah, I understand it looks silly, but does it really interfere with the game itself?  A lot of review sites already say this is unacceptable. I say, it's no big deal. When the game is in play, that's what counts.The game has a fantastic running game. Blockers seem to make holes and are smarter around running down the field with you. The classic truck stick is still there, although I dont think it's as powerful as it once was as a veteran Madden player will probably agree. 16 has a ton of new animations to make the game feel more awesome. There's some brutal hits going on in this game. Although I've probably put in 10 hours already, I haven't had any injuries? hmmmm.Passing feels good. I actually prefer to play on the game speed on &#34;very slow&#34;. I think normal or even slow is too much speed for me, but that's just a preference.  QB's with lower ratings finally are making more incomplete passes and they are definitely inconsistent! That's good! I noticed in 15, QB's with bad ratings were sometimes going 25 for 27 in one game! Now if your QB is just a bench guy or not very good in general, you'll see a lot of short and overthrown passes. This is a good thing again if you're playing a team with strong running game, but a passing game, not so much. QB's seem to get more rattled. As mentioned above, you're going to see some great one on one battles with the new &#34;aggressive&#34; catch option.  IF you want to play things safe, you can go for the regular catch or possession. Going for strictly possession, you lose the ability to get yards after a catch. Some people like to just let the cpudo all the work, that's fine, but you lose your ability to make big plays. That's the rules with madden for years, if you take over, you have a better chance at making something big happen!Defensively is still fun with the &#34;behind the back perspective&#34; Sometimes I feel like the camera does some funky things after a pass, but I can usually play good defense sticking with this angle. The hit stick, while still there, doesn't seem as intense as past years? (Is this the NFL saying tone is down EA?) I sure hope not. Either way, it's good we still have the ability to make a big hit to cause those fumbles!Presentation is better than last year, but it's not light years better. Some new commentary lines here and there, a bit more details, but they still sound like they're reading too much. Not horribly bad, but needs a rehaul for next year.The graphics are stunning. The players faces got the most love, you'll see that in the intro. Very detailed stadiums, amazing use of lighting and shadows and spot on reflections on the helmets.  Some of the cut scenes they show in between plays etc are a bit over done, but hey, if you like presenation, there ya go!The classic and most beloved mode is back, the Ultimate Team mode. Build your team of scrubs into the ultimate Madden team and take them online!Speaking of online, I haven't had any major issues, EA has always had decent servers. I've only noticed a few games with a little input lag, but it's very good considering how many people were playing at once.Madden 16 is a great game. Anyone new to the series should pick it up. I don't know if I can justify 60 bucks if you have 15, but if you're a Madden fan like I am, I already know that you probably already have it. God bless.ility to make big plays.

So far...It keeps freezing on Tuning Data Update. Currently I'm rating this a one star because it's faulty on release. I'll keep updating as days past. Hopefully this doesn't keep happening.*** UPDATE *** 8/26/2015Game stopped freezing as of today. The glitch could of been EA servers causing a timeout issue when Tuning is being updated? I'll update my review once I play a few days of it.*** UPDATE **** 8/31/2015THE GOOD:- Graphics are enhanced, but nothing &#34;wowing&#34;.- GUI is revamped and is a little smoother.- Animations have been improved to match physics.- The ignite engine is finally showing itself on the Xbox One.- Gang tackling is not limited by a certain amount of players. It's a nice touch!- Different perspective views for replies and highlights.- The new &#34;battle in the air&#34; is exciting. I love how the WR's and defenders go at it.THE BAD:- MUT is still terrible in my opinion. It's All About The Microtransactions. Current roster and fantasy roster game play is where it's at.- Sound effects are basically the same. It's nothing thrilling.- The songs are terrible! I disabled all the &#34;songs&#34;. It's far by the worst Madden music.- Commentary is recycled from the last 3 Maddens.- Throwing mechanics are still terrible.- Players (One cut RB's, speed players etc.) don't feel fluid.- They claimed to fix the off sides glitch. It still occurs...a lot. Other bugs and glitches occur BUT hopefully patches fix these.- Rosters are not accurate. Some players are missing and some shouldn't be in Madden this year.- The load times are insane. I know content has increased because of the &#34;next generation of Madden&#34; but this shouldn't be happening to this extent. Load times come from bloatware coding and copy/pasting old generation code.OVERALL:Madden 2016 is decent...at best. EA tries to create or bring back &#34;new content&#34; but they almost always fail to execute. Also, EA keeps recycling content over, over and over. It's 2015, almost 2016. Fans want great sound effects, attention to detail (not grass), commentary and overall realistic football game play. We don't care for MUT (some may though) and bogus microtransactions as content in a football game! I've been playing Madden since it's 1992 edition on Sega. I stopped playing Madden in 2004 when NFL 2K5 arrived (It sucks it only lasted a year. EA knew it would lose Madden and took actions on purchasing NFL licenses etc) . However, I came back to Madden when the 2010 edition was released. Now about 6 years later...I think it's time to stop giving $60 to EA for Madden.er, over and over. It's 2015, almost 2016.

Hey its Madden With EA ACCESS I got to play the game for 10 hours this weekend. Lets start by saying this is a solid football sim that gives us something that is better then nothing. With no competition it really is hard for EA to innovate anything ground breaking. Some people will get excited for the new pass catching buttons. However if you play on All-Pro or above they add little to nothing in value. Half the time the button you press isn't what happens anyway. The New fantasy draft mode is fun once or twice but isn't something we will all be playing 6 months from now. Micro-transaction Ultimate football is back and as lame as ever. Touted as the most played mode in Madden I don't know a single person who plays Ultimate team mode. If you like paying more money to get into a fantasy draft franchise go for it the rest of us are laughing at you.Honestly Madden has because something of a standard then a trend setter. You get what you expect with a few new fresh coats of paint each year. Its not a bad game, it doesn't deserve 1, 2 or even 3 stars. Its a solid 4 star experience that needs some competition to push it to the next level. If you can wait until November the game will be 10-20 bucks cheaper as it is every year.With all that said I have to recommend EA Access for nothing else than the Discount on games. I went in thinking that the 10 hour trial wasn't worth the 5 bucks I paid for EA Access however when I purchased Madden from the Xbox live store I only paid $53.00. Essentially it saved me 2 bucks and I got the trial free. EA Sports returns it's gridiron game to the masses in Madden NFL 16. This year's game host new features and old favorites that should appeal to anyone who has been a fan of the Madden Series. I will go over all the different modes you have to play. One of the new features that brings a whole new experience to the game is Be the Playmaker. You now have three different catch options to chose from. They are as follows.1. Aggressive catch: This is a high risk/high reward option. Say you are down a score with little time remaining on the clock and need a big play. Using the aggressive catch could provide you the score or yardage needed to win the game. But beware, your receiver has a lower chance of catching the ball. It could however, be just the thing to lead your team to victory.  It's all up to you now.2. Possession catch: You this when you need a clutch pass to your receiver. You most likely won't get any additional yards after the catch but it comes in handy when you need a big play from your QB and receiver.3. RAC Catch: Look to use this play when you need your receiver to make the big play and turn it up the field for more addition yardage after the catch. I would only use this when he's pen because you do have a much bigger chance of throwing an interception id he's cover well.Another new feature in this year's game is called Draft Champions. I will be honest, when I first heard about this new mode of play, I was not impressed at all. I thought, here we go, another new gimmick I won't be playing. I could have not been more wrong. When I fired up the menu, I saw the Draft Champions mode and said, what the heck, I will give it a try. Now, I'm glad I did. If you are a fan and like playing Fantasy Football as much as I do, this is where you will be spending a lot of your gaming hours in Madden NFL 16. It brings the Fantasy Football aspect to Madden in a way that fun and enjoyable to everyone.The Gatorade Skills Trainer Mode: This is a great place to brush up on your Madden skills. Whether you are a long time player of the game like myself or just starting out, you can learn the ins and outs of the game and the new features that were added to Madden NFL 16.The Gauntlet: This mode was first introduced in last year's game. It's basically a series of drills that will help you become a better overall Madden player. It's a great way to try and beat your scores and improve your overall game.Connected Franchise Mode: A lot of new additions to CFM makes this a more enjoyable experience for guys looking to create and control your favorite NFL Franchise. Everything from a new way to scout your players to giving the Commissioner more options to make your online CFM run a lot smoother than year's past. It's still not perfect by any means but it does show promise for future Madden games.Online Head to Head: If you enjoy playing your friends, family or just looking to for a game to play, this is the mode for you. See how you stack up against some of the best Madden players in the world by going online.Ultimate Team Mode: Build your NFL Dream Team in this mode. Long time fans will enjoy yet another Season of MUT in Madden NFL 16. I know a lot of guys will spend a lot of time and effort in creating their Ultimate Team. The more wins you get, the more coins you can earn in order to strengthen your squad.Practice Mode: Need some extra time with your team to learn harness your Madden skills, then practice mode is for you. Learn your team's playbook backwards and forwards by spending time going over your go to plays. It's time well spent if you are a serious Madden gamer.Super Bowl 50: It's the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Arizona Cardinals in this fictional Super Bowl 50 matchup. You can replay this opening of Madden NFL 16 as many times as you want. It's a great way to get a taste of the game.In closing,Madden NFL 16 is just a flat out fun game to play for anyone who has enjoyed previous versions of the Madden series. It's not without is faults however, but has more than enough good traits to keep you coming back for more. This is the game Madden fans have been waiting for. I, for one, am glad Madden Season is finally upon us!", "Good product, prompt shipping.  Thanks! Love this game use to have a copy but it broke so i bought another one it was great", "excitebike world rally for the wiiware is the greatest video game in the universe a true classic the best of the best excitebike world rally for the wiiware rocks product is as described", "Rarely write a negative review but am cery disappointed in the advertised DVR capabilities. They are non existent. I have done hours of research and it turns out I can only record a select few non desirable shows with my Xbox. The game play is not any better than my friends PS4, the user interface is designed to get you to spend money and not to have fun and be entertained. Which is why I obviously bought the thing. Very limited instructions on how to use It with cable box. Microsoft is not what it used to be. Buying a PS4 today cus Xbox is a scam and is just frustrating. Having to order a replacement due to system not working out of the box. Not accepting games or movies.  Konnect also not working Dad loves it Come on it's an Xbox one, need I say more?Actually, I can say more. For starters, it's an awesome gaming console. Thw graphics are amazing, and now that I have the ultimate high definition TV to go with it, it's even more amazing. The only problem I have is it doesn't have enough games to it yet. Now I have to wait for the virtual console update to be able to play 360 games. But that feels like it's taking for ever.", "It works as expected Has great battery life. Great little controller for gaming on the go. Good value for the money. I enjoyed this a lot better than the MOGA pocket, as it has more compatibility with apps. I have an android phone, and this is easy to pair and works with almost everything I throw at it.There are two modes on this controller, A and B. I pretty much use B for everything as it is a universal setting and I haven't had any problems. A mode is a proprietary mode that is made to work with certain games, but I feel like they aren't keeping up with it as there have been problems for me in Android Lollipop.Battery lasts a long time - days - if you don't charge your phone with it (which phone charging is an awesome feature by the way). I love the way this controller feels. It is the perfect size for portability and ease of use. However, the Moga app that you are required to install does not work with every game.", "One battery didn't work after first charge other is fine. This is great now I can get away from the battery monster for a bit. Ordered for my cousin The part that holds the batteries broke within two days. The batteries messed up my controller. DO NOT BUY! excellent Not the correct battery toggle didn't work with the battery", "My son was so happy to have the game he wanted I never in a million years would have thought this game would be fun. But I picked up for my daughter, but I end up spending more time on this game than her. It's even fun building with your child or friends. Would recommend this to anyone.", "Masterpiece! Love the Wii U games.  Mario 3D world on the game pad is awesome My boys are enjoying this tons.  They have connected with lots of their friends. I have been a long time fan of Nintendo. I started with games on the initial NES, continued playing with enjoying the pinnacle of the golden times of the N64. I owned a GameCube and enjoyed the little known gems of Eternal Darkness.  Owned a Wii enjoying the more casual new games of Wii Sports to the gems of Metroid Prime. This brings me to the Wii U. The high quality games aren't as abundant as have been in the past, but there are some gems, however the Wii U has some annoying problems.  First, I've always had problems getting Wifi to work. Second and more importantly, if your Gamepad that comes with the system breaks, you are close to SOL.  You can return it to Nintendo and be gouged for a repair at 2/3 cost of a new sytem, or you would think by a new gamepad, but no. Nintendo does not sell brand new gamepads. Long story short, if your gamepad breaks, which was surprisingly fragile, your systems become much more like a paper weight. I've always been a fan of Nintendo and its consoles, but do not recommend this one. Thanks its arrived 5 days earlier and nothing broken or damage \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb great deal. Everything is here, and it works. What more to say? I waited three years! Why!? i bought this for my daughter and it came in ok but we tried putting a game is and it was broken! Its great.  It has provided hours of entertainment.  you can play games or watch hulu, netflix, amazon prime.  It is an all in one package. I bought this Nintendo Wii U Deluxe Set for my son, got it today and set it up and the Wii U console is defective it was frozen. I contacted Nintendo support to get assistance and even after them going through MANY different steps NOPE the console is defective and won't function.I will not be buying from this seller again. I got the Mario World bundle set over the other one. Mario is awesome and brings back so many memories from when I was a child. This set comes with the little black box for the games, then built-in games as well, and Super Mario 3D world, all in this $300 bundle. The console itself is not very big, sits above the Xbox One perfectly on the left side free of the vents. Has two buttons for turning on/off and then the game eject. The red little light tells you when it\u2019s off, and stays that way until you turn it on, then is blue. The console is only compatible for the Wii U games only. Which you can find used ones at GameStop for a great price. The console isn\u2019t very heavy at all and can be put anywhere since its so little and long. The sensor for the fun active games is just a long bar, that\u2019s flat and sits on any surface or unit nicely, and the cord is long.Now the game pad that comes with it is pretty awesome, I so myself. My 5-year-old loves the game pad, you can play the games on it, instead of using the TV, so you can play on the game pad while I watch my shows. Its got volume control on it, its touch screen, the sensor goes pretty far from the console, so you can sit anywhere you want when it\u2019s fully charged up. As long as you stay in the same room of the console it will work. When the game pad dies, plug it in, you can still play, and the cord is pretty long so you can sit comfortable.I got some extra pieces for the Mario Kart racing game, with the steering wheel, makes the game more fun as always, we got the Mario and Luigi remotes as well. Then Mario Party 10 as well. 10 is a ton better than the previous 8 ones. All in all this is a great bundle set, and doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg. Its fun for all ages, adults and kids. They offer a wide collection of games for it, old school, and new games. The unit can be put away nicely in an entertainment set or stand perfectly for easy access. The system hooks up to WiFi, and the built-in games are kinda cheesy, but some are pretty fun. If you\u2019re looking for a system that\u2019s easy and fun, and not to complex this is up your alley. You can even hook up Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Instant Video on it as well.in games are kinda cheesy, but some are pretty fun.

Update firmware, get companion app for smartphone, best set out there. Power button broke after having for two weeks, couldn't turn them on.  Also got a weird rattling in the left ear cup when noise cancellation was turned on.  Would recommend if have the money, get Astros instead. The elite of the elite. Pro - Wireless.  Love this, but there are too many cons.CON - they squeak every time I move my head at all!  Not the speakers but the headset itself is making the noise.  What a major disappointment.  They sound fine but this is unbearable.  Skip these and go with anything else.  Wireless is great but does not make up for that.CON - they are not comfortable at all.  They are tight and cause ear pain after a very short time.  Forget long gaming sessions.  I guess if you have very small ears or something they could work for you.Skip these for something else.UPDATE: Can't get anyone at support to help.  Phone number is often down. First I'll  say the look and options of this headset is great. But the bad over shadows the good. The ear cups are way to small and pinch the back of your ears but that's not the worst that would be the constant buzzy sound even if nothing is playing. I'm am come from the astro 50s and have never heard any thing like this and they are way more comfortable. I would Not recommend these at any price but at $300.00 wow what crap. TLDR: The ear pads are glued on and not replaceable with aftermarket pads. I found this out the hard way. I could actually see the lining and the glue seams inside my right ear pad when it came unglued after using for a few hours. Pretty disgusting to charge folks 300+ for something that has glue and plastic. Sound was great, the parts surrounding these cans not so much.  Initially, I got this headset and within 3 days I wanted to return it because of the odd way the pass through works with wireless chat on xb1. Now I have changed my mind because I can use it for wireless 7.1 simulated DTS sound, but not chat. I changed my review to 4 stars because of this caveat. The headset does clamp down somewhat, but noise cancellation and great earpads are help that negative portion. Also, the material is loosening up after a few weeks of break-in time.  First, the look of the headset is definitely in that high end category, it's made to last. The second major thing is sound and of course the sound is incredible. I have other headsets like the g930, hyper X cloud II, px4, Sony golds, and 420x for comparison. This one has much better surround sound with the 7.1 DTS by far and of course the Bluetooth capability to listen to music or take a phone call AND hear game sound at the same time is awesome imo. The sound is also crystal clear with balance throughout the sound field. Also the bass is pretty darn good as well. The presets are many and are customizable via apps or pc downloads. There are over 16 presets set as default with the ability to customize to your liking.  The saving grace of swallowing a 300 dollar price tag is I found a way to make this headset work for my xb1, ps4, ps3, and Xbox 360 after a week and a half of finding the right toslink splitter. A toslink matrix is needed to pull this off. If anyone is interested in that, please leave a comment on this review. Needless to say I have wireless game sound on all 4 consoles and wireless chat on the xb1. I have not tested if I can use wired chat with the ps3 or ps4, but generally sound is the same on XB1 with optical out. The sound was so good that if I couldn't use the optical out then I was definitely not interested in a 300 dollar DTS headset only for one console. My main issue was that I wanted to play MGSV on PS4 and Fallout4 on XB1 and have great sound with some versatility. Having the charging base as an active pass-through into a matrix solved that for me and I love this headset now. Being able to use an android app to control everything is also pretty nifty as well, which is also the only way to adjust the mic monitoring ratio.  Now for a few negative issues I don't like, but for the sound quality I'm gonna live with. -battery life with noise cancellation active is lower than anticipated, less than 10 hours. -cannot use chat features on other consoles, but can get DTS 7.1 on PS4, X360, and PS3 once passed through a toslink matrix. -headset can hurt your ears after a few hours until broken in fully. -will need a tablet or smartphone w/bluetooth to fully adjust mic monitoring because of the supported Bluetooth app that Turtle Beach has. -some people may not go for the hidden mics because they are not as good as boom mics, but I was told that over my xb live parties that I sounded fine. Update this headset with the latest firmware from day one to avoid any issues. -the price is hard to swallow, no questions about that. -volume levels for some people may not go high enough. I factored this into the fact that it can go uncomfortable depending on the presets, games, or apps being used. For my usage it is very adequate.  Finally, I do think for all the features, great DTS sound, and presets that this is worth the asking price, at least once I got the pass-through working. There are other options available, but this thing has superior sound over pretty much anything I have used up to this point. EDIT 09/10/2015 rating down to 2 stars... I had to file a return on these due to theright ear pad coming unglued. Yes, I said unglued because you are stuck with those ear pads on the elite 800 and 800x. Its a shame because I wanted to put some HM5 replacement pads on these. This was my last run at a Turtle Beach product. Throwing down 300 dollars plus for glued ear pads is not for me. For 300 bucks, go grab a Astro Mixamp Pro and Sennheiser G4me Ones or Zeroes. I wanted to give this a review, as I didn't find any reviews that talked about the things I cared about. Firstly, This is a very well built headset, it has some heft, and generally it feels expensive. The fit is pretty tight. I have a pretty normal head and these are tight: I seem to be able to go about 2 hours before I need to give my ears/head a rest because of the pressure. All the controls are on the ear cups - which isn't ideal but after a few days of taking off the headset to see what button to push, you get used to it. You'll definitely need the manual to learn how to dial em in. The sound quality is VERY good- there is no doubt they are one of the best if not the best sounding gaming headphones you can buy. Plenty of bass. The noise cancelling is average at best - it doesn't compare to my bose qc25's. There is no crackling or interference at all - mine are dead silent.  The mic situation is rather unfortunate - with the firmware update people can hear you just fine, but it sounds like you are far away from the mic. Not ideal, but it isn't like you cant be heard or have to yell like some people say on here. Now my least favorite part - the mic monitoring (aka hearing your own voice amplified in your ears to compensate for having the headset on) is AWFUL. Firstly, the mic monitor level can only be adjusted via the ANDRIOD only app - by default it is set to about 80%. Secondly, the level is never loud enough- with noise cancellation off you can hear yourself okay when the game volume is low, but if you want any volume it seems like there is no monitoring at all, and you end up screaming because you can't hear yourself. But wait there is more! If you want to run noise cancelling FORGET about hearing yourself: turtle beach won't let you adjust the level with this mode on. It is almost like talking with earplugs in. This was almost enough to make me return them in itself; seriously frustrating. If you play serious multiplayer - I bet this will be your sticking point.The main reason I am keeping them is the sound quality and the seamless bluetooth integration. It is awesome to easily take calls or listen to spotify while you play. They sound great for music and calls work great. The charging dock rules as well.good: Well built, Out of this world sound, bluetooth rocks.bad: Mic is average, Mic monitoring is terrible. This headset is well worth the 300$! The fit is perfect me, the set up only took like 2 minutes. 2 cables, power for the station and the digital in and out and that is it.YES! These headphones are COMPLETELY wireless even when chatting! No need for chat adapters or anything! But what I had to do with mine was go to my device setting on my xbox and assign this headset to my profile in order for me to start using the mic. I am not sure what causes it but if anyone is having trouble with Xbox not showing you that you are using a mice, then do what I did.Setting&#62;&#62;Device Settings&#62;&#62;&#62;Headset&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;Assign to someoneI did music test while going to school with the bluetooth and it runs smoothly and works perfectly.Charging is easy and simple to do, just flop the headset on the charging station and BAM you are good to go!I would prefer these over the Astro A50's any day!", "Amazing game Delivery was fast and the game works just fine. Only problem I had was the disk was loose in the box sliding around and was a bit dirty. Worth the price that's for sure", "Great game, my little brother loves it he plays it with his friends often! One of his favorites! Good product. Fast delivery service. i \u2764 it its awsm fun cool good epic allso on the pc Kids Lovin it! I will admit I don't understand this game much, but my kids ages 6, 7, and 10 are all big fans. They'd play it for hours if I let them. They have had no issues whatsoever playing it on their Xbox 360. Hahah well it is strangely fun, but I found that it got old quick.Maybe I just don't have the time to build insane mansions.. Grandson liked it. This item was for my great grand son and he loved it.  Thank you. PC version is much better.  This version is a bit clunky and the Xbox controls don't help that.  Its playable, but not that enjoyable. Fun game that allows anyone to be creative - the sky truly is the limit! Fun for filling your time here and there or dedicating hours on end to make a cool house or something else extravagant. My grandson loved it. This game is instant entertainment for hours/days/weeks/months. If you're viewing this item now, I'm sure it's because you've heard all of the hype about this game, and those who talk about it don't lie. It is such a creative and addicting game with so many options for playability. It's a blast to play with your friends, and even just by yourself. It has pretty much all of the features that it has on the computer, minus the mods of course. Microsoft constantly releases new add ons and updates though so there's always more to do. I would recommend this game to any person of any age. i love the game but i would not work on our xbox 360 i 9 year old daugher wanted minecraft so ba o xboxbut she has no been able to play it on there at all yet but it is the xboxs fault not minecraft I bought this for my youngest son and he loves it; he can't seem to get enough of it. It's a great game The game works fine and all three of my boys have enjoyed the game since it arrived with no problems at all. Thank you works great!", "I haven't found too muvh use for it but it works perfectly fine and as intended. It has a few cool features too. i love it Fits perfectly on my tv. Great device The product performs just fine.  We purchased this solely for our younger daughters to use with their Just Dance games.  Camera picks their movements up just fine.  Is it exact...no, but being that they no longer have to hold a controller when dancing, makes this not such a big deal.  Our major complaint with this camera in general, is the cord that you have to connect into the Playstation  is super short.  When my husband went to Best Buy to purchase another identical one to make it longer, they told him only the manufacturer makes it and it would need to be ordered through them, online.  When we received the additional cord, it didn't fit into the original cord to extend it.  Come to find out, others have had the same issue and have posted on forums online that there is no way to extend the length of the cord at this time.  Major bummer if you're Playstation is hooked up on the other side of the room, such as if you have a media room for this kind of hobby.  We ended up having to move the entire Playstation closer to our screen, which then meant we needed to make other cords not related to this camera, longer.  More extensions needed.  Kind of a pain if you only plan on using this for Just Dance games. I'm satisfied with the PS4 camera's function overall, except the camera's field of view is slightly narrow. But other than that it's a great peripheral. I don't see why so many people complain about it, came with a stand, and can adjust at almost every angle. It's perfect! I love it My boyfriend loved the camera. It worked really well Love the camera been playing playroom and just dance all this time good purchase just like u said the product would be...thanks Not for low light room. Xbox One Camera works better. They love it. I haven't used it but my son and grandson are really enjoying it.Thanks Works great, do wish there was some additional sound canceling functions built into the PS4 or this mic on the camera besides that works great and easy to install/setup", "you can plug it! I'm glad that I do not have to go to rip off game stores for this product. The price is very nice for a replacement charger. The only issue I seem to have with it is the length. It is much shorter than the original charger cord that comes with the DSI. it did not work and broke in 2 days of charging &#62;:-( I ordered item and when I plugged it in it started smoking and wasn't connected to the item I purchased it to charge so I know wasn't the item that caused the charger to short out. Luckily I had it plugged into a surge protector. When I tried to return it to exchange it, said it wasn't eligible for return.", "Great game Gameplay was really fun. The story was kinda meh.", "It is working wonderfully. Great deal, works great Works great and design is beautiful Works as stated. exellent", "im from Turkiye, very very tnx, This version of the Kinect puts the Xbox 360's version to shame. If you are getting an Xbox One I would definitely get this to go along with it. Excellent Excellent All perfect Thanks The Kinect in general is pretty fun.  It definitely needs some work, especially if you are a tall guy like me, but it is a lot of fun to play with the family.  I would highly recommend getting a mount for it and placing it over your TV.  That seems to help things out a lot.  As far as Dance Central Spotlight, you could really do without this game.  It is easy to see why it comes free with the Kinect as it is mostly a money grab game.  It comes with 8 songs, and you have to download any other song you want at about $1.99 a piece.  The game doesn't play real well with the Kinect either, you'll spend a lot of time trying to get it to recognize you and your motions.", "Great game as usual. Not really any different then previous years ( nothing new there) Prime customer but got it the day after it was released even though i pre ordered a month ahead. We order this game every year. If you're a fan of Madden, you'll be happy with this game. I recommend the deluxe edition to help get your ultimate team started. get Madden ever year. Definitely feels like a different beast then past maddens. I can see the aggressive catch getting abused in head 2 head, and there is a couple of glitches that need to be taken care of, but otherwise it's a great game. Great concept to add the catching options, feels like a more enhanced experience. Much better than Madden 15, mainly because EA added the Draft Champions and the songs that play when you are on the menu. The only drawback would be the commentary during the games but it shouldn't take away from the actual gaming experience. Great job by EA on this version. It's Madden. What do you expect?! Great game ! When I pre-order a game I usually get it on release day . Not really a huge deal but I got this a day after release Got it on the same day. TY. Poor shipping disc arrived ajar in case True... Its the best Madden Ever.. No bull Buy it if you're a real NFL fan... its worth it. Got it today at 12pm today AMAZON PRIME PRE ORDER!!!", "This is best game i ever played. I own ps4 and gaming pc.. but i cant stop playing this game even its old. Great story arrived on time as described, would buy again", "They sound nice and the mic is pretty decent but they completely fell apart within two months of purchase. Its a real shame that these have such terrible build quality. I do not recommend unless you have a freakishly small head. Perfect. But didn't know if it came with a charger or not. Oh well Excellent headphones. There is multiple volume adjustments and settings to really control sound. very happy with it. Good quality. Effortless set up with my PS3. Crisp sound.I wish I bought this one to begin with, instead of couple cheaper ones that don't last. This Sony looks durable, and is very stylish. And I love the wireless part- no more I have to unwind my wires or take headset off to get a drink from kitchen. head sets kick but made me look at my dre beat a little different lol They were great for about a year but they are now useless as they have cracked between the band and the earcup. Right below the small round plastic disk on both sides!!! One side cracked completely where only the wires are holding the earcup still,while on the other side its a major crack thats almost as bad!! Poor build quality!! 100 bucks?! p.s.-I took care of them and never threw them around I'm a 44 year old gamer. Sound, bass, pulse vibration, now thats what I call  damn good headset lol I just received the product on August 22, 2015. I use this for my PS4It is an excellent product. The sound quality is good considering the price.  I rated it 4 stars because I don't understand the product completely. Especially when it comes to BassImpact and VSS. For the base impact, when I play Call of Duty, it is so sensitive in a way that it vibrates to every sounds, which it leads mo to discern the source of the sound. Even if I set in the lowest setting. This is when I put in Shooter mode. Another thing when I turn on the VSS, I feel it's the opposite. I feel the sound is more surround when the VSS is off. I don't know if the problem is me or the headset.About the quality of the material, it seems fine and looks sexy. People say they break easily. I can see that if you don't take care of it.I wish they add more features/presets in the headset companion app. Also, anything that would indicate if the VSS is on. (I know it is the icon on the screen when you turn it on. But I want also a separate indicator on the headset itself.", "The game would not download to my PS4 I tried foe 24 hours and I CAN NOT PLAY GAME Need for Speed games have been hit or miss for me in the past, but generally speaking I like the series overall. I have to say this is my least favorite NFS game so far.The game looks good on PS4, taking advantage of the new hardware and producing the best graphics in a NFS game yet. However, after just a few minutes of play I noticed glitches where textures wouldn't load in or my car would sink into the ground. That's disappointing considering this was developed by one of the richest most successful companies in the world. EA can and should do better.The gameplay is fairly bland. You can play as a cop or a racer, and both offer three activities each. The lack of modes makes Rivals get stale quick.As you play you earn Speed Points, which you then use to buy new cars, upgrades, weapons, etc. As a cop there's no risk of losing any points you earn, but as a racer you can and will lose all of your points often. In fact, as of this writing I have not once banked any points as a racer and thus have not been able to buy upgrades and progress in the game. The AI cops as well as the human player cops are super aggressive and without upgrades your car will be destroyed quickly. When this happens you are &#34;busted&#34; and lose your multiplier, all your Speed Points, and are booted to a long loading screen that takes you back to the garage. From there you go back to a long loading screen to return to the world and repeat. Whoever thought this was a good idea, it is not. It is the most frustrating, infuriating punishment I've had the misfortune of experiencing in a game. And I've been gaming for over 30 years.If you like unfair, aggressive AI and losing over and over and having a game waste your time, buy this trash. ok", "If your Astro A50s have mic problems this is the fix! Pair this with the turtle beach ear force cable and eliminate the problems. This is amazing. Had my doubts about it working with the afterglow wireless headset I had for 360, but after a controller update it worked flawlessly-even the mic works! No longer need to spend 60+ on a new xbox one headset! Just tried my regular earbuds and they work as well! Worked great for three months, but now the left side stereo sound keeps cutting out. Microsoft quality has really taken a nose dive. The Xbox One itself seems unfinished... It has less audio controls than the 360, which is why I needed this in the first place. Very few Xbox One users compared to 360 users are able to use mics in-game because of this issue. Its okay Perfect! It was kind of annoying to have to purchase this separately to be able to use my headset with my older XBox One controller, but the functionality is excellent.  It took some figuring out how to make it isolate voice from the game sound, but you can do it and it works really well once you have it configured.  Once you know how to do that, you can easily switch it to listen to game sounds and remove the voice.  It fits nicely on the back of the controller and doesn't cause much trouble with it being in the way. Great item! allows me to use my old turtle beaches again! worth the money!!! Awesome As soon as i bought this product, i wa skeptical but as soon as I plugged it in i was satisfied. Thank you very much Doesn't work with all hands-free headsets. I have Bose noise cancelling headphones with inline mic and volume control, the mic doesn't pic up so I have to wear uncomfortable wired hands-free sets from the days of blackberry, if I want to talk to anyone...", "Ugh omg, I love this series more than words can describe, and this game was a perfect end to it. It was super cool. I loved how the game played, and the antagonists were perfect for the setting of the game. The story was insane in a totally good way, and the ending will leave you going &#34;WHAAAAAAAAATTT?????&#34; Love it big fan The best bio-shock title, it was cool to have the main character talk.Elizebeth was beautiful and Booker is one bad motha...such good dynamics and environment. A great game for any gamer in your life.", "Best Bey games ever 7 year old son loves this show and loved this product", "fits great Got it fast works great good quality fits perfectly As described, this is a soft plastic case. None were available by any other retail manufacturer in the USA when the 3DS released. Good product. Good price. You can not pair this with other accessories, like the grip. my grandson loves it . I'm happy he is happy This is exactly what is says it is a clear protector that is hard cased.  If you or your children have slipper fingers, this case is not for you.  It will not handle the impact that the Nerf brand case will take. Fits perfectly and I like that there is a little bend to it.", "Game is awesome! As someone who played the older versions. I imagine that I will get hours of fun out of this! I have never played Disney Infinity 1.0 or 2.0 so I am basing this on my experience with 3.0 so far. First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do. \\If you're contemplating getting this then just do it. If you have 1.0 or 2.0 and want to upgrade then I'm not sure if it's worth it since I have never played them, from what I have hear you can use your 2.0 base and only buy the 3.0 game but don't quote me on that. My son loves it and can't get enough of the stories and missions. Super appropriate for his age (8) and the game provides hundreds of hours of play time. Wish the figures were about 30% cheaper or more, but Disney knows they are minting money with this game. Epic", "I play all my old school games and more. Best devise on the market...Really!!!

This games are my favorite xbox games. I can set for hours at a time and play. So for a 53 year old it better be good. I can't wait for FarCry 5 I hope there is one until then I well play 2,3,and 4. So good shoting and don't forget keep your powder dry. Great immersive game. This will keep you busy for weeks on a solo campaign. Loss of a star to the unnecessary foul language by the radio DJ in the game...whoever wrote that dialogue needs to find another line of work.", "Works great! Looked better on HD tv! Third Party (Non OEM) Component Cable. I was surprised at the quality of this cables construction. Quality was exactly like the OEM cables.VERY durable quailty. Functions perfectly. Nice 480p output from my wii to my hdtv. Worked GREAT! Now our Wi is in color! Expected high def capability using these, but experienced horrible blackout issues (during game play screen would go black for 1 to 2 seconds every twenty seconds or so). Seems to be a common issue that I resolved by lowering the settings from 720p to 720i. Cables are good quality and arrived quickly, just wish the results had matched my expectations. Worked great I have been using this all afternoon.  And let me tell ya  it makes the graphics on an HD TV so much better I personally only play mw3 on it and it sure helps track people and watch movement Works as you would think.", "great Gave it as a birthday gift OH Thank you DLC is a must As described Great game thanks This game is a technical marvel. Masahiro Sakurai thank you. In my mind this game saved the wii u for me. Although the sales of the console are still weak this game made the console worth the price in my mind. Please if you have a wii u you must own this classic. My Wii U was working flawlessly until I purchased this game.  As soon as the update downloaded & installed itself, I got a gamepad error code 165-6596.  Googled it and found many others encountering the same exact problem as a result of this game.  Called Nintendo and they're trying to tell me my gamepad is broken and they want $99 to fix it.  Ummmm, if it's broken then how come it still works just fine with ALL of my other games?  This is ridiculous.  I've owned every console Nintendo has ever released, and I never had a problem with ANY of them\u2026until now.  If Nintendo's game/update is causing gamepad issues for people, they need to take responsibility for it rather than using it as an opportunity to extort more money out of their loyal customers.  I certainly regret purchasing this game, as I can't even play it! Super fun", "GreaT great game, forge, fire fight and invasion are a blast my brother loves this game. Good product. Fast delivery service. My only problem with this purchase was that it came in an unlabeled case", "Incredible, I can't say enough about this fast, versatile Gaming/Streaming device!!! I'm spoiled by the speed of this console. Go from turning the SHIELD on, to YouTube, to Gaming, instantly. Downloading apps, games, is as fast as it gets. Don't hesitate, get one! I bought the 500gig version...So many good things to say I must mention the Shield Grid game streaming is unbelievable !!! HiThere are slow when Engage Hard Drive from usb i highly anticipated the SATV, and put in my pre-order the instant it went on sale... however, after having used it for a little more than 6 weeks, i find i cant recommend it to anyone at this time.i was looking for the shield to do two things: replace my roku for video content, and allow me to stream my pc games to my living room tv... and while the SATV does do both things, it does neither of them well, and is a pretty huge disappointment.the selection of video content is shockingly poor. if all you use is netflix, then you will be happy with the shield, but past that your choices are severely limited. no amazon instant video, no vudu, no hbo, not much of anything. netflix, and google play video. thats about it. supposedly, vudu and hbo are coming 'soon' but who knows when that will be? and it is my understanding that amazon instant video will likely NEVER come to the android tv platform. why? because amazon, thats why. which also makes me rage, but is an entirely different issue unrelated to the shield.as for game streaming... where do i begin? i have had a love/hate relationship with nvidia's gamestream product for years, since i got the first shield portable when it came out. i had hoped that nvidia would correct some of its many, many, many deficiencies with the SATV... but no. when it works, it is fantastic. WHEN it works. gamestream has suffered multi-day outages of its host discovery servers, and continues to do so on a regular basis. generally, every 3-4 weeks you can expect it to cut out for 2-5 days at a time. because of shockingly poor decisions on nvidia's part, this host discovery is required to stream EVEN when the shield and the host pc are on the SAME WIRED NETWORK. and even when you are able to get connected to your host pc, gamestreaming is plagued with problems: their controller emulation is woefully flawed, you can expect it to work for about 1 game in 5, because of the technical implementation. generally, you can expect most (but not all) big-budget games to look for a controller in the 'right' way that nvidia supports... otherwise, you are out of luck. this can be worked around to some extent with third-party tools, but when you consider competing products like kino console are able to provide a controller emulation layer that works 100% of the time, nvidia's inability (or refusal) to get this right is inexcusable.also, if you have a projection hdtv, like a dlp set, i hope you can live with having about 7% of your screen cut off on every edge, because the SATV has absolutely NO overscan correction. again, every other android-based tv device i have played with (and there have been many) includes overscan correction in its settings (including googles own android tv device), and it beggars belief that nvidia didnt include this and continues to refuse to add it.then there are all the other issues like the SATV being sorely lacking in audio and video codec support, having many performance glitches in the pro model owing to, evidently, poor hard drives requiring RMA, finicky peripheral connection, poor external media support, on and on it goes.the SATV has potential to be a great media box. someday. assuming nvidia gives it the support it needs... but if youve had nvidia android products in the past, you know how likely that is (hint: not likely at all)...all things considered, give this a pass. get a roku 3, and a steam link when they come out. Awesome purchase! One of the rare instances where my expectations were exceeded! If Nvidia had enclosed the remote control, in addition to the controller for early adopters, it would be perfection!!! In all honesty, if you have are a PC Master Race guy with a sick gaming rig but love the idea that you can play them on a massive 4K (or HDTV) in your living room and realize that consoles are very obsolete in terms of what you get out of a PC, then this is the true console killer device. I can stream any Steam Demo ( even not mentioned in the supported titles) and much more from my PC and that is cool enough for me.Unfortunately here is some cons:1. Playing fast FPS games will display some very very minor lag, so if your used to seeing the butter smooth movements on your PC monitor with fast FPS games, you will notice a slight difference. This is due to streaming but also to the TV refresh rate. In my opinion, I will play FPS games on monitor because i'm competing against PC players and you need precision.2. You must have a 5ghz router, so throw away your 2.4ghz. If your less than 50mbps your wireless gaming will suffer and you wont want to play PC streaming. Best solution, hard wire through ethernet ( maybe even drill a hole in a wall and feed it through if you can )3. You will notice slight quality degradation compared to your monitor during game streaming primarily always during fast paced action, slight blur while image refreshes and catches up with the wireless signal. I love this device.  Needs more apps, google is slow to get them approved.  Still missing Amazon Prime Instant Video.  Laggy in the home launcher, but once in the app that you are launching, it works fine.  500GB is a bit overkill, especially for not easily being able to put data onto it (no google drive, no DS cloud sync, just ES file explorer).  But when the only other option is 16GB, which is room for maybe 2 of the bigger games (Portal, Talos Principle). Fantastic system. The whole family uses it. Awesome This thing is amazing.  Plays downloaded movies with Kodi, Live channels if you have an HDHomerun, Emulators, AAA games, easy to root and easy to restore the software if you ever need to (Nvidia has the original software available for download), plus a 500GB hard drive to store all your ROMs, games and movies.  Incredible.  Easily the best set top box/console I've ever owned.", "nice charging base for the 3ds xl but you have to take your protective case everytime you charge did the job nicely", "Jump on things, kill things, mamma mia!

The game is really great and has a lot of bosses. I am a true Mario fan. Thanks", "Great With all the characters at their disposal you think a better and more intricate story would have been created, but no, very bland, very very bland. The best part of the game is probably fighting with Spiderman, I just expect more from a Lego game, especially when you consider how good the Lego Batman games evolved. This game is much better than Disney Infinity. Graphics are solid, and it has a good storyline. Product as described. so entertaining, 4 and 6 year old love it. don't have to worry about violence, and this is a brain stimulating game in my opinion since kids have to constantly solve puzzles and think outside the box. I highly recommend it.", "I purchased the polka dot case. It's really cute without being over the top and makes it easier to find the case among all the black accessories I own.I use it with the new 3DS XL and it fits well. The hardcover case is appreciated because it allows the case to keep its shape and has a better feeling grip. The size is also good. The arrangement is efficient enough that it only needs one zipper. If you want an idea, it's about the size of two 3DS stacked on each other.I can't speak as to how it holds the wall charger, but I use a usb cable charger and it fits in just fine.

AWESOME!!! cool game", "Perfect! These games are getting progressively worse.  The first was awesome, the second was less awesome, and the third....you get the point Excellent. Love Assassins creed unity! The graphics are unreal. The layout for France is beautifully done. The open world concept is engaging and there are so many facets and different ways to play, it will keep you engaged for hours upon hours. The main story line is brilliant and your side jobs, or co-op missions are excellent. You have heist missions, murder mysteries, and Nostradamus symbols to unlock. You develop assassin skills through creed points in this game, and your level of assassin is only maintained by accumulating points by playing the game. Definitely recommend this game, and the Dead kings option as an add on to the game. It opens up a whole new story for Arno (main character) to play. I am conflicted about how to rate this--it is a spectacular work of interactive digital art that we should not take for granted, but I am giving 4-stars because the formula is wearing thin.  I loved the historical aspects and the graphics and the combat and collecting.  If you like any of the following games you should like this because they are all the same game in a different skin:- the Assassins Creed series- the Batman Arkham series- Shadow of Mordor- Far Cry 3 & 4 (same but in 1st person)The formula is...climb towers to reveal collectibles in the area; explore the map to collect, buy, and upgrade your skills/equipment; level up to where you can complete the core story and inevitable boss battles.  It breaks down like this timewise: 10% main story, 20% side mission stories, 70% exploring, collecting, buying, and upgrading.  I like all these games, but taking a break after this one.  On a positive note, this one minimizes the sci-fi thing and lets you stay in the historical immersion except for some voiceover from Abstergo Control and a couple of time-slip sub-missions.  I learned a lot about the French Revolution because of trying to solve the Nostrodamus-speak riddles with the clues buried in the encyclopedia entries that you collect.  The combat is brutal and graphic and surprisingly customized to your weapon of choice. There's a lot to like here about it with the open world, collectibles, and fun missions. But that is all a moot point when the game doesn't run smoothly. If I ever get the urge to actually finish this game I'll just pick it up for my PC. If you can handle the frame lag pick it up but if you're accustomed to a smooth flawless gaming experience don't waste your time.", "Arrived promptly perfectly intact from the seller. The person that received this gift loves it and is glad I ordered this one (master chief collection) over the call of duty special edition. Takes a long time for the games to download. I bought a &#34;brand new&#34; version of this system and it brought up a system error. Three days and five separate phone calls with xbox later (to try and solve the issue) the final guy I talked to said &#34;it shouldn't be doing that, it must be a faulty xbox. Send it back and I'd suggest buying one in a store.&#34; Which is what I did- the exact same thing for the exact same price, except THAT one worked right away. As far as this actual product, I'm enjoying it so far but I'm skeptical about game systems from here now. Fun and done. Love this over our Xbox 360, and glad to finally have upgraded. Incredible graphics, but the familiarity of an Xbox. Love it, love it, love it. WARNING...DEFECTIVE HEADSETS...! the headset did not work new out of  the box..i went through all the things they recommend you do to get it working...but broken is broken..then after spending a ridiculous amount of time with support @ ms..they said headset needed to be replaced.  now here comes the neat part...i would have to pay the shipping to get the item shipped back...even though it did not work new out of the box...upon doing some research, i find their is a major problem with the headsets failing and people going through multiply returns and replacements. if you are going to need or want to chat, get ready to buy an after market brand set to use no one has any thing good to say about the headsets...ms just figures we have a pile of these junk things, if you want to pay to ship them back..no problem, we have plenty of these defective things we have to dump on you. now for the console..ti appears to be doing fine the graphics are good and time will tell if the product last or not.. Had the newest controller with 3.5mm built in, 1tb hdd and new headset more like the 360 headset I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, current and upcoming (November 12, 2015), shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spaciousand cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack and shouldn\u2019t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven\u2019t included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller isn't yet available, but will retail for $150 (about triple the price of a regular controller). If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.  Current bundles -  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating.  Legacy bundles-  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4. Awesome...Love it. Excellent Hey it's an XBOX ONE......can't say alot more.  Perfect Awesome This model shipped to me within 2 days and came with all the noted components.  Worth noting is that the xbox one does not come ready to play out of the box.  Several updates stack up and can take hours depending on your Internet connection.  A wired connection is recommended as the xbo has slow wireless speeds (even checked against other devices).  Another grievance is that the halo mcc takes a long time to download.  I wasn't able to play until after the first day which included leaving the console on overnight.  Despite these flaws, Amazon delivered the console as ordered and at a competitive price. 5 stars Great Console; was very happy to give away my 360... love it - but they need MORE games I am honestly surprised at how much I am enjoying the x-box.  I am a lifelong, diehard PC gamer and most of the time, consoles are foreign to me.  Truth be told, I am having a lot of fun with it (albeit first person shooters are a whole new world on the console!).  It is a substantial initial investment, but once you get over that it is pretty fun, especially if you get a Kinect and play with the family.  Now that Windows 10 is out the integration between the two works really well.  I use my PC as a DLNA server to play all my music and video files right to the x-box, and I stream games and apps right to my PC using Windows 10's built-in x-box app.I love living in the future. This was probably one of the best buys I've ever done - value wise. I mean, you can wither get a 500gb version for $345 or pay the extra $45 and get 1TB (double the storage?) The 500gb console can probably hold like 20 games while this can hold a ton. I have both Halo and Far Cry 4 on this beautiful disaster and I have only used 11% of the capacity. Being Far Cry is like 20gb and MCC is like 60gb. Not to mention the operating system and files for the console take up more space than the games.You can't go wrong with the 1TB. There is no reason to get 500G now this model is out. Unless you're seriously strapped for cash it's a harder decision, but if your so strapped - don't buy a console.As for Halo bundled with it, the game is actually not very good. It'll take you ages to get into a lobby and the single layer campaigns are just plain boring. I only play co-op on the story for this reason. It seems like the stories are all there to just grind out the 6k achievements you get for doing them. I got this for my son and he loves it! It's a fun game.", "Great Items... Very Fast Shipping! The Xbox accessorie cords work perfectly . I had lots of trouble finding all the correct parts to get it up and running.. now I have them. Cheap and in a timely fashion. Surprised and thankfull. Thanks , Amazon .", "My eleven year old grandson absolutely loves this game.  It was his favorite birthday gift. My son loved it Probably the worst Lego game yet. Doesn't even feel like I'm playing a game but rather just watching a series of cut scenes. 2 stars only for hearing Jeff Goldblum do his, &#34;ha HA!&#34; Item as specified. Good As with all Lego games, this one does not disappoint. My boys have been playing it non stop since he opened it, and the replay value is pretty good.", "This controller is really cute. I have noticed that it sometimes messes up while trying to use the motion sensor. We sometimes drive right into the wall in Mario Kart for no reason. But most of the time it works just fine. We like the controller and all it was a great product doesn't light up like the after glow ones but is still good for the price", "They met my expectations, except for the fact that who ever packed them bent the cardboard backing to make it fit in the box. That kinda irritated me. Other than that, fine! Love it My kid was super happy to get it. Thank you! Love the price & the set sent cannt wait too order the new star wars set I love these amiibo, I was unfortunate in buying them when the game initially released, so I would see them at stores and regret not having bought them sooner. They very well made and despite a few details here and there they look great. The challenges were very fun and it nice to have the gear and the weapons exclusive to owning them. My only problem is my box was a little damaged possibly due to shipping.", "Awesome! great product still  untouch", "Came quickly and was just as described Perfect! Didn't get a chance to put this to the test because it isn't for my Xbox 360 model. But it does come packaged well. I would give zero stars if I could. But I should've known for the price it would be cheaply made. It doesn't work at all. Waste of 14 dollars.", "Awesome! One of the best Halo games I've ever played.", "This is a really good controller and if taken good care of will last you about a year. Great Good product Great product & great vendor I will shop again. Love it!! Love the price I paid for it even more!! Order a blue and a black last week August 20th 2015, came from Amazon LLC. Package came this week Monday August 24th, and today Thursday August 27th as of writing this review, the blue which I mostly used is already failing!?! The sticks especially when used in combination in fast First Person shooter games (COD Ghosts) is failing, sticking or rather stops responding so suddenly my rifle is not moving as expected.So after three days - WOW! So either Sony who I already believe employs the most retards of any company are producing TOTAL crap, or this is a counterfeit controller.I called Amazon and reported the issue. They are today sending me a replacement, and provided a return label for this one, and will check if it is genuine upon return!Until the replacement controller comes, I can't play split screen with my son, so disappointing! The two controllers that I got with the system a year ago also from Amazon, worked for almost a year, even though both top rear buttons started to stick after a week!SONY I HATE YOU!!! Great controller. Battery life seems longer than the standard controller that came with the system. works as advertised! Love it! Just like the other controllers for a much better price! Love the color.", "I've been testing the PDP AG7 True Wireless Headset for Xbox One for a few weeks. The first truly wireless headset that I've seen, the PDP AG7 is comfortable -- even with my large head. All of the other Xbox One headsets I've tested have a wire for chat that runs from the headphones to your controller. Not the PDP AG7. The key is in the clever USB transmitter that plugs into the Xbox. It connects automatically so you don't have to struggle with those awkward BlueTooth connection processes.One feature I especially LOVE is the separate dials for Chat and overall game volume. No more messing about with the plus or minus tabs trying to strike a balance. The PDP AG7 gives you the control to dial down (or up) chat with a dial. The same with game volume.The overall sound during gameplay is amazing. I can now hear when enemies are behind, to the left or right -- or above me in games like Titanfall. LOVE the sound.The on/off button is on the outside of the left hear piece. Just tap during game play to mute your microphone.The only ding for the PDP AG7 is that the mic is way too sensitive. It picks up everything -- the ceiling fan included in my case. I wish the mic were only calibrated to picking up your voice. Not a huge deal but annoying. Also, when you mute yourself the tip of the microphone (which is blue or red (extra bass)) flashes periodically to let you know you're on mute. I could see it out of the corned or my left eye (even when retracted) so I put a little piece of duct tape on it. Problem solved.Overall though this is by far the best headset for Xbox One I've come across. Comfortable. Excellent sound -- and truly wireless. Two thumbs up for the  PDP AG7! OK so I might be a bit prejudiced but I've always been a fan of Turtle Beach and it's what I own and use with all my gaming systems. Now I like giving others a try and having boys who destroy headsets I personally don't buy Turtle Beach for them but get them cheaper versions. This I got for my 14yr old who games more than he reads.I decided to test this headset out for myself while doing the Gears of War beta. Now if you're a big fan of FPS then you know why games prefer the Turtle Beach headsets. With a TB you feel like you're right there in the game. Sounds is amazing and you can't beat that. These on the other hand, the sound wasn't spectacular but at this price I wasn't really expecting them to be. The set up was easy enough and I was able to wear them for about an hour before they started to feel irritating around my ears. TBH that's a problem I have with most headsets anyway because of the bulkiness. They do feel comfortable once you put them on and the padding is enough to not make my ear hurt on instant contact.Now I did have a bit of problem with the mic. It seems like I had to shout a little louder for my teammates to hear me. Not something I want to be doing in the middle of the night. I seem to be hearing them ok but they couldn't hear me well. Besides that small issue these would have been a great headset. Maybe they could get that sorted out.Now if you have kids and don't want to spend the money for a Turtle Beach then this is a safe bet. Great headset.  Very easy to get working, just sync and play, very easy.  Sound quality is great, even has a bit of protection from outside noises.  They are comfortable and fairly lightweight, plus there are no &#34;sweaty ears&#34; like some other headsets.  This is my first headset from PDP, but they are great and well worth trying out.  If you need a good headset for the Xbox One, this is a great option. Bought this for a true wireless headset for my xbox one. Works perfectly just a little umcomfortable for long gaming sessions This product is great.", "Kids love it! I have to admit that the LEGO Movie was amusing, and it was fun to see some of the elements and humor brought over to the game.  Thing is, while there is more of an adventure mode to this game, it still seems to be a re-re-re-repeat of every other LEGO game that preceded it.  There are also some gameplay elements that are not quite intuitive.  It's nothing we really go out of the way to play here at Casa Rudy, but it's not a terrible game either.  A good one to get at a discount.", "very good. I loved. Lives up to expectations. I bought this as a gift for my bf. He loved it. However,  the light on the statue didn't work. We tried different batteries and still nothing.  Ruined my gift for him on his bday. Now I'm returning it for a refund. Disappointed with Warner brothers. Please do your quality control right. Strong candidate for GOTY for sure! Really good game to end the series .... No Boss fights though ..so it makes it feel like somethings missing ...the items in the collectors edition are actually quite stunning to look at", "awesome!!! Works as advertised. Very quiet operation Terrific product, has lowered my XBox One temperature dramatically. Well built and quiet. This thing is pretty awesome. Not sure why it doesn't extend the full length of the vent; about 2 inches short. My only guess is to allow for better venting when first turning the XBOX off after high usage. SUPER easy installation. Heat sensing, and fairly quiet. You can hear it come on, but it's not overly distracting. Definitely worth the money so far. This intercooler does what it says. I keep my Xbox one in an entertainment center with only the front having and opening, before my intercooler I use a digital temp meter to see how hot the area where I kept my Xbox was getting and it was reaching temps of 92 to 95 degrees....now with this intercooler the air in the same area is hitting 83 to 88 degrees and blowing all the warm air out and to the front....so yeah, I'm happy with it. And also the fan noise isn't noticeable over standard TV volume. Not as noisy as people made it seem. People also complain that the fan keeps working after they shut off the xbox and that's probably cause the xbox is still hot even after you shut it off. It turns off once ur xbox is cool. fan does really pull air into the xbox and vents it. so far so good. My xbox has never been cooler, I can feel the warm air leaving the system and the system box itself is cool to the touch. Great investment for the longevity of my system. Well worth the purchase. works very well Great product. Tempature activated, unlike the PS4 nkyo intercooler. Not too loud either. Sweet I always get one of these for any of my consoles. Heat and electronics do not mix and this item will no doubt extend the life of your console. Awesome cooler.", "After 2 months it died! I only worked for a month, lame", "This charging station works perfectly. I even use Rock Candy branded remotes in it and they charge up nicely. I do not use the straps on mine, they may get in the way of the charging dock. No more going through a ton of AA batteries. Works great charges great what's not to love about it", "Exactly what I needed Exactly as I expected. No wires, low price and works well!! This product would never work with my internet and is out dated so fun!!! It's exactly what it says. Just the Wii and nothing else. I don't know if this was intentional, but mine had an sd card in the sd card slot. Thanks all the same. Had no issue. Very pleased with my purchase. Will purchase from them again. Love it!!! I'm on it  everyday ,and it serves as my primary entertainment hub. I don't even watch my cable tv now lol. Netflix Netflix Netflix, mario mario mario mario, Netflix, Amazon video. Great purchase", "No Works in Nitendo DSI. works great,fast shipping", "short but awesome game Amazing game played for hours!!!!love the WALKING DEAD!! this game is boring with poor graphics.", "i love it came on time It's a cute yarn Yoshi. So cute. And works great. Was so happy I was able to get my hands on one. Perfect just as described.  Fast Shipping. Love the item and good price but package was damaged Its Yoshi, and he is made out of yarn. You know you want it. Arrived in perfect condition. Very happy. Totally worth paying a little more then retail to save me my time hunting for one and getting months a head of the U.S. Release. So adorable :)  I love it.Shipped nice and early too. Great find", "Amazing game! Truly a classic. It's NEW! My favorite final fantasy ever! The first copy I had was used but now I actually have brand new discs, case, and booklets!

I can not put this game down!  I'm even playing the mobile game now! meh", "dont listen to all of the ther reviews this product sucks and im a hardccore gamer They look cool but they don't fit very tight to the controller and its thick so it hard to push the buttons", "BEST PURCHASE EVER DONE ON THIS PAGE...I love it... Great!!! Great", "My son loves this game and is very happy to have it! our son loves this!  lots of different games to play.  hours of family entertainment You have my business! Thank you I wasn't as impressed with this Mario Party as it's GameCube forefathers but all the Mario Party games are a good time. Completely worth having to break out once in a while.", "Perfect delivery, unfortunatly it is not playable on European Nintendo 3 DS machines.No problem sending the game back. Perfect, that is why I buy at Amozone.com. Great game that inspires kids to learn while having fun. A few parts are difficult for my child but that is because of age.", "Fun game Another great pokemon game. The new mechanics are really interesting and fun.", "Wonderful games! Been a fan of the Red Dead Series for quite some time now. Rockstar really raised the bar with this one back in 2010 and the game has aged wonderfully! I'd love to hear of another Red Dead some time soon Rockstar! A lot of people would! RDR is basically the GTA of the wild west.I won't go into detail on the story, as it is best experienced (plus others have quite extensive reviews on the story alone!)If you get RDR, I suggest the GOTY edition, for it has zombies.What game isn't better without a little zombie action?In all seriousness, the additions are very fun and legitimately add value to the games entertainment.Have fun!", "the Word doesnt work.

We use it as a party game often.", "My son loves the Disney Infinity set. I don't like that you can't use them on the first system.  We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.  Great buy for any family fun or game night.", "Does its job. However i feel it is a bit too overpriced, considering there are equally good, free youtube fitness lessons available. Workouts are too slow", "Best Keyboard adapter out there! I paid a little more than the website sells it for but don't pay more than $150.00 for this.Must use Android device or PC with Bluetooth for it to load profiles. I was super hesitant to get this because back in my PS3 days I had tried something similar called FragFX and it was absolutely terrible. The lag on that thing was so bad it was more of a handicap than help.That is not the case here, it's truly 1-to-1. It feels like I'm playing on a multi-thousand dollar gaming PC. I'm SO much better at FPS games it's like a different person is playing. I play on my PS4 with a Logitech G700 mouse and a Sony Navigation controller, from the couch with a small lapboard. I couldn't ask for a more ideal gaming setup.If you're put off by the supposed lack of iPhone support, you should know that it's just a matter of PM'ing the developer over on the XIM support site, and asking for an invite to the iOS beta. It works great on my iPhone 5S.UPDATE: It's now officially iPhone compatible. I still use the XIM daily and love it, best gaming purchase I've ever made. was a little hard to set-up and the wireless (bluetooth) never wanted to connect to my phone, but otherwise works great.", "This did the job.

Adult might find that the board is too short and too simple to play. fun game. gamepad player is on his/her own team. really surprising", "Not the best GT but definitely brings out the most of what the PS3 is capable of.  Worth adding to your collection if you like the series. if you have been a gt fan dont hesitate! they are still adding cars, tracks, races, online groups and races...the physics keeps getting upgraded as well..car manufacturers are designing prototypes and submitting them! its off the hook! the wheel sets have never worked better, and keep getting better. its so realistic my own car feels like it does in the game!! Pretty cool, I'm still working on it, barely scratched the surface!

I can say that is true but it is not perfect. It also has it's flaws which at times really can be upsetting.  First let me try to explain why i think this is a good game. I think the first thing i noticed when i popped the disc in and loaded it up was the Graphics. They are truly representative of the ps4 potential. The graphics are top notch. The cars all look beautiful, the weather, the sun and lighting effects are all realistic. You can change the time of day in most races and if u happen to be driving while the sun is setting... Well you're gona have a bad time because the sun will be blinding. But at the same time thats pretty darn impressive.  Another thing this game has going for it is the simplified/stripped down approach to racing. No silly story here. In fact right after the loading screen, you are put behind the wheel of a Mercedez Bens AMG. Not even a tutorial if i remember correctly. But thats what i like! Thats what i expect from a racing simulator. No silly story that doesnt make sense. No annoying anouncer telling you to slow down on your turns. Nothing. Heck not even a soundtrack unless you change the default settings and turn the voulume up from its original 0% it's meant to be all driving and focus on the sounds of the cars.  Ah yes the cars.. This topic is somewhat difficult.  Yes we already established that they look good, they sound good... But do they handle? Well see here's where driveclub can become an issue if you dont know what it's trying to acomplish. This game is a pure racing simulator. No forgivness. No rewind no nothing. So yeah the cars will perform as they're supposed to. Dont expect a Hyper car to handle all fine and dandy when your going 180+ mph. They all have a unique handling.and especially so depending on the weather condition. If its raining and you're in that rwd car haulling ass... Forget it. You're toast. All the cars required me to do a practice run and then go for the real race.... And i would still come out 5th place. This also has to do with the AI which is yet another thing that grinds my gears when playing this game. Just picture them as beyond professional. They are not intimidated by you and they follow a perfect line all through the track. Im serious this game will require multiple runs through an event. But yet it is still fun. Because it's really satisfying to fail a couple of times and then finally get in the zone and come out on top. Truly satisfying.  Just be prepared. This is no need for speed.  Ah yes now is everything all worth the pricetag? Well.. I would say it depends. I spent about 25 bucks. Amazon at the time that i am writing this is out of stock but that doesnt mean you cant price match it at a store! Thats what i did. I showed em the 25 dollar price. And they matched amazon. However apart from That i spent another 25 for the season pass which is the cheapest method to obtain ALL the dlc and extra cars. Without the dlc you miss out on a ton of stuff. So if u plan on playing this without the dlc then i would say its not worth it. You will be missing out on a lot.  But for 50 bucks total spent. Im really enjoying this game.  So here's a basic good/bad summary of the game  GOOD: Visuals, Sound, weather effect, simplified racing approach, cars are demanding yet rewarding to drive  Bad: AI will have you beat often. No ability to change AI Dificulty, incomplete roster of cars/events if you dont purchase season pass DLC. Does this game require patience? Yes. It was okay!!", "Good product still working happy with the purchase Product arrived MUCH faster than I expected. Very happy!", "I'm new to video games, and am only in the middle of MA1, but so far, I am hooked. Excellent game, excellent price, and seller was very prompt.", "I like this games great", "Works but cheap.. 6 month's they will probably need replacement. Really nice and cool lights but they arent really bright plus one of the bulbs didnt work. I bought this for my son in April. Already the mic doesn't work. I guess you get what you pay for. Received Great headset to have for your little gamer! It's a great quality headset without the high sticker shock! Good quality but very fragile, they broke a week after and the replacement I got was bad too, faulty wire most likely. Works better than my original headsets. We got this headset for around $7 so for the amount of money it was ok. It worked great but it's not very durable and unfortunately had to buy a new one a few months later. I think if an adult got this it would be ok, but for my son who used it daily, it didn't hold up for that long.", "Good price, good quality and durability. Lasted me a year so far without issue. Can't speak for the UMD storage, because I don't own any. But it will store a PSP and keep it nice and safe, and it feels like a solid, nice thing with good zippers. Can't go wrong with it. I love it that it was shipped right away. Great product for a great price!", "Quite average. Some give you quite a work out", "Great item. I love that I don't have to constantly get new packs of batteries. Had it for a week so far. Love this product. So easy to install and much better than being tethered down by wires. Very sleek looking as well. doubles as storage and functionality. Good Within days of use, the contact for the front controller had busted and could only be charged on the rear dock. This may have just been one defective one, but either way, I found [[ASIN:B00L2FGR7W Nyko Modular Power Station - Xbox One]] a much better product. A bit less convenient, but very solidly built, made to blend into the Xbox one, and very good all around. So far no problems here unlike the other folks that complained it didn't make a good connection for a charge.  Nyko hasn't failed me since I first bought a similar charger for my old Xbox 360 system. Come on, nothing is better than never having to buy batteries again. This is a great investment and you will start getting your money back after only a few weeks. I bought two. Overall, this is a pretty good charging station for the XBOX.  My only real complaint with it is that the batteries don't last as long as I would like them to.  With regular batteries I can get maybe a week or so of really solid playing (more than 6 hours a day), but with these charge packs you are looking at about 6-8 hours total before they need to be recharged.  Not a huge issue if you have a second controller to switch to or you aren't a diehard, marathon gamer, but something to be wary of all the same. keeps my controllers ready to go when I need them. Bought as a gift for my brother and the product no longer works. It does not charge the controllers any just from regular use. Great price, works Great Works awesome. Had one for the 360 and loved it as well. Love being able to charge without changing batteries. Stand works well and looks good. Great price and a great product!  The hubby is very pleased with it! Pins do not align up properly and over time you will be in my shoes... Looking for a new dual charging station or using a USB port. Gone are the days of having to quit midgame to swap batteries. You will always have a charge because of the sheer convinence of just plopping the controller down and getting a charge. Highly recommended. Saves tons of $$ on batteries.  The battery pack is tough to get in, but once it is in you don't really need to take it out again. This will charge my controllers, but not after a lot of hassle, and even sometime then, they will randomly stop charging even if they had originally gotten going.  Initially putting the controllers on the device, i have to try, usually about four times, placing it different ways before it all lines up and gets acknowledged by the charger.  And before anybody asks, yes, the batteries are in the correct way, but thank you for your concern.  My charger just doesn't seem to be made that well. Easy to use and charges the controller. The battery cover could be nicer without scratches all over them. I like how you just set the controller on it though, very quick and easy to do.", "This is a wonderful case!  This was the only case that I found that would carry the 3DS XL, games AND the charger!  The spot for carrying the charger is perfect.  Highly recommend! This travel case is perfect for gamers on the go. That tagline may seem clich&eacute;, but this case has it all. There are 12 pockets for 12 games (3DS or NDS), which is quite a lot considering I normally only carry around 6 with me, but now that I have the ability to carry double that amount, I'm sure to utilize it as time goes on and new games are released. Having a pouch for the charger is extremely convenient when going on long trips. In addition, the case keeps everything compact and organized. Although it is, as a whole, a bit big, a strap comes along with it so you can hold it in whatever manner you need to!", "The game was in very good condition and I have had no problems with it The serves to this game are terrible. Awesome!!! Great game, but, 2k has unreliable servers. Great for basketball fans and great career mode but after a while it got repetitive very good Great game", "poorly made. the little slot on the device that hooks up to the usb broke easily. on the day it arrived. too expensive for something that's cheaply made. waste of money. i'm very disappointed... Cheap I used it the first day I got it and then I putt it in my 3ds and a white screen comes out don't know how to fix it This thing makes games fun and exciting. The item itself came in and brand new, I love it and it works. Buy it now Works ad described", "My husband needed this to repair his nes he has been holding onto since the eighties.  Watching a YouTube video he was able to take apart the new, replace this part and have it working like new.  He knew he needed this part because the games would come up grey and fuzzy or go in and out when inserted. After the replacement the games went in really tightly and the cassette didn't even need to be pressed down. product is as described", "great charger .. I recommend it ... buy it very easy to install and charges the controllers very quickly. Also doubles as a good place to put the controllers. As advertised. Great charging station! I had another station for charging, that was a pain because we had to line up with ports. This one, you just put on a sensor on the remote and then just drop it on to the charging station. There is a wrong way to put the remotes on the station where they won't charge, but it's a really easy shift of the remote. One of the USB adapters did not initially work. Emailed nyko, got next day response and replacement within a few days. Great customer service just dont loose the little thingies and youll love it Excellent for keeping those gamers happy and charged and an excellent price too! Great charger Works great to charge my controllers.  I've found the little dongles attach securely, yet are not difficult to get off if you need to emergency charge the remote while playing a game.  Nyko has made several great products, this is yet another one. Great product, Thanks.", "dusty and not cleaned.... Product came in the condition that was promised. No complaints here.", "Good product A must have for anyone with a Vita. Does it work on your vita? Yes, quite well. Was Sony's idea to force gamers/parents to buy entirely new memory cards for the Playstation Vita system a good idea? No. Not cool at all.Also, if you're downloading games, buy the 64GB one. I learned the hard way.", "It came well packaged and undamaged. Just what I wanted This Amiibo looks amazing and is detailed perfectly! Couldn't ask for anything else from the big N! Came shipped in a new unopened box with US packaging. Works perfectly!", "hmmm... a $50 worth of credit for $60. This is pure genius. I'm already thinking of the game i could have bought with that extra $10. priceless!! It was a gift for my grandson and he loves the game he bought with it.  Happy grandkids = happy grandmom. Why pay more than $50 for a $50 gift card", "love the game It's a nice game, and the slots it replicates, is good.  You do not need to leave the disk in the computer to play it.  We have had a problem with the game freezing for about 10-15 seconds then continuing on. Great game!  Just like being in the casinos, but I save a lot of $", "great Meh, kind of boring. I don't like the first person shooter play. My son and I played it a few times together and got tired of it quickly.", "ok I don't like that you can't use them on the first system but my son is happy that they came out with the super hero's on the 2.0 system.  We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.  Great buy for any family fun or game night.", "Was in my mailbox, before date.. impressed Delivery  (Brand  New) awesome ! ! exactly what the shipper said it would be. a little worn but works great.", "One of the best games of our generation! Awesome Cheapest price for a code and it is one hell of a good game! This game is one of the best games I have ever played. The Story is very fun and full of suspense, it makes you care for the characters and you feel a part of the game. The graphics look great on the PS4 and the Multiplayer will keep you coming back since that is also great. If you are getting a PS4 then this has to be one of your first games especially since you can get this for ~$15. Excelent Arrived safely Amazing timing, I got my code email to me within 2 hours of buying and code was accepted and works perfectly. A++ seller&#34; Came right on time and setting it up took less than five minutes.  Great offer for such a really good game. Although some times the matchmaking takes a bit too long. SOMETIMES. other than that the game is epic and i love the multiplayer. WOW.The best game I've played in a long time. It has a Fallout kind of feel to it.This is not a slash and bash shoot em up game. If you run head long into most enemies you die. This game requires strategy as well as weapons. Stealth is the key.The characters are surprisingly deep for a video game. Good game and will be my favorite like always", "great game nice find on amazon yes Great game, a steal for the price, highly recommended one of my faves of last gen", "Works well for my set up Perfect! My ps3 run 1080i on my not Hd TV :) works", "Awesome! LOVED IT", "Great sequel for great game. The product came in a good state. Great game.  Wish there were more of them.", "Works great and arrived sooner than expected ... Very peased I bought this controller due to the fact that my original DS4 controller broke after about 1.5 years. Even though the controller is white, dirt doesn't show up very easily. Overall a well made and great looking controller. Would recommend. Works perfect, feels great. I can't say for sure but it seems as if improvements were made on the analog sticks and around where your palm goes. Fast shipping and overall very pleased. Really nice and comfortable, use it to play PC games that require a controller. Switched from the 360 controller to this and I can say that I feel so much better using this. Perfect My boyfriend breaks these too easily First of all I love the layout, weight and feel of this controller.  I was very excited to have a white controller and loved it right out of the box.  Now that I have been using it for a month, I can say that it does have enough issues to prevent it from being a 4-5 start purchase.The charge - I play maybe 5 hours a week on a good week, so I'm a casual gamer.  I fully charge this through the week and when I plan on gaming, the charge is down within 6 hours or less of active use.  I used to be able to use my PS3 controllers for over a week or more without having to plug them in.  I can't play two full nights in a row for 2-3 hours without swapping controllers.The L3 button sticks, or doesn't register at times.  My left thumb hurts for days after playing from having to hold the button down so hard in order for the button to register.An occasional delay has started popping up from between when I push a button to when the character reacts.  I don't mind much but a serious gamer might be very upset at this.For me it works, though a longer charge and sturdier buttons would be what it would take to make this a 5 star product. It's authentic and awesome! I love it", "Fun, but kids do need quite a bit of help to start. My 4 year old and 7 year old nephew love this game. It's easy to play.", "very nice game with different timelines and puzzles. really like it I bought this game on a complete whim, knowing nothing about it or the Zero Escape series. Little did I know that I was about to play one of the most beautifully constructed puzzle-solving mystery games of all time. Everything about this game is brilliant, from the complex puzzles, to the unique art design, and amazing voice acting. What REALLY makes this game worth buying though is the story. Each decision you make in the story will take you down a different &#34;What if?&#34; path, all of which share certain events but are unique enough to make replaying certain parts absolutely worth it. The ending also has one of the craziest plot twists I've ever seen in any sort of entertainment, be it a video game, movie, or book. Overall, this game is as close to perfect as a puzzle-based game can get, and it's one of my all-time favorite games. One of the best games I've played.  Fun and challenging.", "It's good Runs quiet, but note I have only been using it for 2 days. I will update if that changes over the next month or so. But I give it only 3 Stars because the posts that are suppose to hold the unit in place, simply dont. Not even a little bit. Now granted as long as the PS4 stays (horizontal) in one spot and you never have to move it for any reason what so ever - the fan attachment will stay in place. But pick it up or decide to try the vertical PS4 set up and the fan assembly will fall right off with 0 effort.", "Love them! The length is great! Decent length and it gets the job done. Alright value. It is not 6 feet long, short by an inch.", "Love this controller! I'm glad they added the headphone jack in the controller. The adjustments to the bumper buttons has proven to be most beneficial. The 3.5mm headphone jack is awesome. I actually use it with my PS4 elite headset and everything works great. The pattern is really nice and overall feels like a good controller. This controller is awesome and it's my main one now. The finish is a tad shinier than the picture shows, but it's still a matte coloring. It comes with batteries and those last about a week of solid play. I recommend picking up a recharge kit and then you'll be set. Perfect. Love the pattern on the controller. Needed a second controller and purchased this as a present. Got one of these at Best Buy. The D-Pad is defective-you tap a direction on the pad and it will not register a large percentage of the time, so you have to tap twice, some times 3 times in order to get it to register. Built well. If you're going to have multiple xbox ones and need to keep track of who owns which controller this is a must. I think the color pattern looks better in person than in the photos. I'll confirm it has a 3.5mm headphone jack - which is cool. The fit, finish, and feel of these controllers is top notch.  These were bought in addition to the XB One for my sons birthday and have now gone through hours of use and abuse with no issues.  Even when thrown in frustration by my son or friends, they have not missed a beat.  Having the new 3.5mm jack is nice as well although it's seen no use as of yet.  My son also very much likes the Covert Forces graphics which seem to be of high enough quality as to not rub off or deteriorate.  Very happy with this purchase overall. The build quality is improved and no longer squeaks and creeks when held, but the LB/RB buttons have been terrible on both the original and replacement controller I received. You will not be disappointed.  Very stylish. I was happy that they gave a regular audio jack for headphones.  Very nice feature. 2  THUMBS \u2191.", "A very fun, game. With good graphics for it being a Wii game. However, the controls are hard to get used to, and after you play for about 10-15 hours, the game is really easy, even on the hardest difficulty. But it's still a fun game which can give you hours of amazing soccer time! I still play it even though it's easy now! it was a gift", "The more CDs you put in it, the harder it gets to put them in or get them out. Would not order again! The more discs you put in it, it eventually becomes extremely tight fit and hard to get discs into the sleeve. Nice", "This the bees knees right here man. This was a great deal and the delivery went smooth This product is very nice and the service too. WORTH THE MONEY!!!!! I'm not a Amazon prime member, but omg this is awesome will not find this anywhere else. I'm not paid my Amazon or a troll in reviews. I had doubts that this would be good so I took the risk ordered it and was not disappointed with this buy. Everything is in great condition and at a cheap price for two good games, must buy I'm am not lying really worth the money, I am really picky with reviews so I decided to do one that ppl can rely on telling the truth for all gamers. Hope this review helped one that people can trust. Check out my YouTube! Bliss Gaming. the box was kinda misleading the one i got was not the gta 5 box  it was the the last of us edition lol but hey overall good product very good !! fast ship !! Thank you !! Picked this up on last year's Black Friday for $399.  Opting to go with a PS from an Xbox, I gave it a bit of time, before leaving a review.  So far, I love love love the PS4.  Gorgeous graphics, and I prefer the menu setup over Microsoft's.  Setup was a breeze, as was adding apps, like Netflix and Amazon Video.  Decent selection of games, both hard copy and streaming; all with nice graphics.For the price, this system is definitely a winner in my book.", "Have not seen anything new from the regular Sniper Elite 111. Pretty Damn good", "Have it for PC, but love being able to play in the living room.  Good way to relax after a long day. Best farm simulator game yet Great game", "I love gears soo bad but it's so depressing that it's taking forever to download the game I'm barely at like 30 or 40 percent and I been at this for close to two days already and I don't have slow internet When I open a product, I expect it to start working in 60 seconds. Just like my iPad.It has been over 24 hours. We have been unable to play the Gears Ultimate game we have been waiting for. Why? Because we are still downloading the Gears game! It is 20% done after a full day of download. What an awful experience on my birthday! See attached picture.First it took 3 hours just to start the Xbox One. Very unhappy that it took 3 painful hours to get to the welcome screen. Microsoft, is this cool? (Starting the console required a mandatory ~300 MB system update. I have a ~105 Mbps high-speed cable internet line from Comcast. Xbox one has a wired connection. Xbox is receiving internet speed between of 80 - 90 Mbps. Although the game file is downloading at about ~1 Mbps)Dear Microsoft Product Managers - here is a challenge for you. When a customer starts their Xbox One they should be able to begin using it in 60 seconds or less. If it takes several days to start using their game console then Steve Jobs is right about your sense of taste. And from my experience over the last 24 hours - a lack of respect for your customer's emotions.Folks, wish me happy birthday! Need an additional Xbox One for my room because it really manages my cable TV, Netflix, HBO Go, DVD, BD and home videos via USB outstandingly. Games? I have not play a good game in this console since day one.  I am a fanatic of Gears of War 3 and I bough specifically this console to take advantage of the Gears of War Ultimate Edition game offer. For my my disappointment this game is crap. If this one is the preamble of Gears of War 4, I will continue playing GOW 3, until the backward compatibility for this game is completed. it doesn't come with headset Xbox one is the best I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Rainbow Six Siege includes both R6 Vegas Xbox 360 games, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it. Legacy consoles shouldn\u2019t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven\u2019t included, due to their rarity at this point). You may have better luck at other outlets finding the legacy consoles (Microsoft Store, Dell, various brick-and-mortar stores). There are no functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Current bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Amazon is presently offering a $30 gift card with all bundles, so be sure to select that product version (Microsoft Store is offering additional games and $75 gift card, FYI).  Rainbow Six Siege 1TB bundle. $399. Includes console, new controller, disc version of the title game and downloads of the Rainbow Six Vegas Xbox 360 games, with a chat headset. A new class-based multiplayer shooter with the excellent tactical precursor campaigns. A good bundle. A- rating.   Name your Game 500GB bundle. $349. Includes the console, new controller, a download of one of Forza 6, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Gears of War Ultimate, or Rare Replay, and no chat headset. The choice of games is nice and the selections are high-quality, but 500GB will fill very quickly at this point, and without a headset or bonus games, this is one of the lesser value bundles. B- rating.  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers, and DOES include a chat headset with a matching black and silver color scheme. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller has been released to wide acclaim (modifiable professional controllers can easily go for twice as much), but is scarce on its own at present. If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it. B+ rating. Please note that the bundle with two controllers does not include a second Elite controller, but a regular wireless one.  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage. Bundle with FIFA on separate page is even better for the same price.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Arating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only. C rating. Bundle with Forza Horizon 2 on separate page is a B rating.  Gears of War 500GB bundle (also in white). $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download. This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B- rating. This is the most discounted bundle in sales and has many other offers with it, if you can catch them.   Legacy bundles-  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel is even better, but I haven't tried it yet. Great for adults who love action adventure.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. (I think these are being phased/sold out) I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same.

No headset. Sucks it was only the original Gears of War. Could have had more like the other Xbox One special edition consoles. Greatest gaming system in history, period.  GOW is the best franchise, period. would have been nice if this came with a headset", "Love the Pokemon series,have been playing since I was a kid but kinda still am.the new mega evolutions and one of my favorite regions are back!!! Awesome. my son loves it. Product just as advertised. Great merchant Great! LOVE IT!!!! New story elements different from the original Sapphire. It's basically a completely new game, 3D is kindof minimal though, only really saw it during battles and story cutscenes.. and some Certain areas. Great if you want a new adventure. It seems to be a step up in difficulty however, it may just be me though. (Haven't played Pokemon since the 5th Gen) Came the day it was released to my surprise.", "Some awkardness with trying to follow the instructions with the kinect sensor, which can be frustrating, trying to wave your arm long enough for the sensor to recognize the fact that you're waving, but overall, very fun gameplay--even for adult Disney fans. I was incredibly impressed with this purchase. The price was very good but I was afraid the quality was not going to be good. I was pleasantly surprised!Pros:-Brand new, factory sealed-Disc was in perfect condition-Shipped and arrived faster than expected- Awesome valueCons:-None I can think of!Plus, it's a very fun game. Christmas gift I bought it for my daughter but it's not the game she loves the most.", "good My son loves the Disney Infinity set.", "Love it! Best price I could find for a ps2 card, and has not failed me yet. Excellent Great product, works with all the games I play, and comes with the advertised memory. Thanks! This didn't work on my PlayStation 2! so disappointed. Should've just spent a little bit more money and bought one from PlayStation", "Boys love it Great game . Quick shipping and great new features from Madden 15!! This is the BEST MADDEN 16 EVER YET. The passing techniques give you an option to moss catch and let your receiver be a playmaker in the game which is a cool feature. Great game mode in DRAFT CHAMPIONS, I will enjoy playing this and Also MUT too because of the free 36 PRO PACKS you get for 12 WEEKS (IT IS THREE PRO PACKS EACH WEEK FOR THREE MONTHS. YOU WILL RECEIVE THE FIRST BATCH OF PRO PACKS ON THE START OF SEPT. 1 2015. SO DON'T PANIC GUYS.) and a PLAYMAKER CARD too start off. It is so FAR SO GOOD. GREAT JOB EA. Im LOVING THIS GAME. ITS WORTH THE BUY. Hope YOU GUYS GET THE DELUXE EDITION BEFORE THERE OUT SO HURRY and ORDER! :) Got this game for my husband and he hasn't stopped playing since. The game looks so good and the graphics are awesome Were you excited by all the new features and changes mentioned all over the Internet, in previews and reviews, in videos everywhere?Too bad.  You should have bought an X-Box One.There is no new scouting system in Madden 16 on the X-Box 360.  Instead, you get the new points (fewer points, losing points if you sim ahead without scouting every week), but you get the old system with a bonus (I mean, other than the lack of points making it hard to skim the surface of a tiny number of players): It's bugged.  Every player shows Strength as &#34;fully scouted&#34; with a 0.  Which is just the kind of thing that really helps you figure out which offensive or defensive lineman you want to select!The new passing style might be there, but it's hard to tell at times, when passes seem to go anywhere but where you wanted them to.  There is a tutorial on it, though.Draft Champions is there, and that at least seems like an interesting way to play the game.  Is it worth $60 (or $70 for Deluxe Edition)?  Not at all.It's one thing to see minor changes from edition to edition with Madden.  We get that.  They remove features because it's easier to do that than develop them, or they can add them back later and pretend they're new (like owner mode).  But having an edition of the game where they manage to break more than they add while simultaneously having the &#34;same&#34; edition on another system with a lot more features?  We're getting into new territory here.If you have a 360, you've just been told you're an afterthought by EA.  Make them an afterthought in your own mind.  Don't buy this game on X-Box 360. This may be the last Madden game I ever get. Madden 16 is the same as Madden 15 and Madden 25, besides new players, the voice of Den Roethlisberger when you play for the first time, Draft Champions, more passing options, and U.S. Bank Stadium. I wasn't going to buy it until I heard a great review on WCCO radio about U.S. Bank Stadium in game as being detailed, but that was a letdown. It was detailed in that synchronized fans, empty concourse, and no exterior view Madden way. If you have Madden 15 or Madden 25 don't buy this. If you don't have Madden 15 or Madden 25, buy one of those because it's much cheaper for essentially the same game.", "I was looking forward to opening this and being able to organize the pile of Xbox games in my son's room and it arrived without instructions. Seriously? It was in multiple parts, and nothing to help assenmble. There wasn't even a picture on the box of every side of the tower so that you could have a chance of figuring it out. I googled and the only You Tube clips I could find were reviews of the product which said it was good but hard to assemble. I gave up after about 5 minutes. Life is too short. Outrageous to send something in multiple parts without even a very basic diagram to help with assembly. Wish I'd read the other reviews before ordering. Life is too short. Very cheap material.  Not sterdey at all. Also was missing the controller stands so we can't hold play station controllers on it. Wonderful idea, just wouldn't suggest this product", "I bought this controller for my PC, so my kids would keep their sticky hands off my Xbox One controllers.  This thing can take a beating!!! From being dropped on the floor, thrown on the floor, buttons gummed up, and cord bent to hell. If you're looking for a well made controller, this is a good buy. Great controller and after a year of hardcore use while playing games like the Dark Souls series and FIFA 14/15 the skin of the left thumb stick started peeling off. The controller looks better than its pictures. However, during course of time I faced problems with the left bumper which became non responsive (a common 360 controller problem). However, it was easily fixed by just adjusting the bumper by opening up the controller.", "Very good game. It captures the feel of the movies. Excellent entertainment value. It was way to scary to play after a while.", "Good price. Everything works as described and is very easy to work as well. Shipped and arrived on time. Works great. I had some trouble figuring out what to do, so hopefully this will help some out there looking to buy this.I have Windows 8.1 and did not need to install any drivers. I just plugged this into the USB port on my computer and the green LED turned on for the device. I got my Wireless Xbox 360 controller and powered it on using the X in the middle. Then pressed the &#34;connect&#34; button on the receiver, which then started blinking green. Then I pressed the &#34;connect&#34; button on my controller, which is the small button between the right and left shoulder buttons on top of the controller. Then a few seconds later the top left LED on the Xbox controller X lit up and I knew I was connected. I had a little prompt on my PC about automatically installing the drivers for the controller, then it was done. I fired up GTA 5 and it works flawlessly.For those of you running Windows 10, I believe this receiver  does not work. I think you need to buy the new Windows 10 wireless receiver here - http://amzn.com/B00ZB7W4QUAnd if you're running Windows 7, you may need to install drivers by either going to your Device Manager, Xbox 360 Peripherals, Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows, and right clicking and selecting Update Driver Software. Or manually install them from Microsoft's website - http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows Works great!", "After the trigger PDP case/grip I bought from a local retailer fell apart when I was pulling my vita out of it after less than 24 hours, I started looking for other cases.  For me, this is THE BEST of the Vita 2000 cases after trying different options.  For my large hands it works beautifully making playing the vita as comfortable as holding a playstation controller.  There are some downsides, volume down button is hard to reach on the fly, and the locking mechanism takes a second to secure but given the advantages those quickly become moot imo.  It really is super comfortable. Arrived on time and is made of a very durable plastic. My only problem though is that it does not fit quite the way I want it. The depth and length of the case is a little loose which means it wiggles around. Also, from top to bottom the case almost seems to crush the vita. When putting the case in &#34;locked&#34; position I have to physically force the vita in (with far more force than should be necessary). I used it for a while since it definitely is easier on my hands and wrists when playing for more than 30 minutes, but the design of the case just makes it feel like its damaging my vita so I just don't use it anymore. Great concept and is effective, personally I would not recommend this particular one due to what I see as a fundamental design flaw. I didn't see that it was specifically made for the old model vita when I bought it, but it fits on the newer model okay. It'll do the job What a nice product.  This sure made playing the Vita a much more comfortable thing to do.  I had no idea how wonderful this could be.  Thank you to who ever designed this product.  It's AWESOME.  It changes the whole system for the better. well designed; fits nicely;", "Super fun to play, I have not mastered it yet but with so many things to do it may take some time. Good game! It didn't come with the box or packet, but seeing as I just wanted the game it's great!", "The item arrived on time and undamaged. I bought two of these and they're both in very nice condition. The packaging on one of them was kinda messed up (not bad at all), but the reason I bought two was  so I could open one and hang the other one up, so it's not a problem to me. They came when they were supposed to as well which was awesome! lucario is one of my mains and i love this amiibo This was a collectible for my son, for his birthday. He LOVED it. :) I love it. Its a well crafted amiibo and it arrived in mint condition. Ok", "given as a gift Stupid game", "ESO is tons of fun! I play with a few friends and all of us love the elder scrolls world! So the thing to remember is that if you enjoy the world of Eldet Scrolls than your will love this game! The one thing you don't want to do is go into ESO thinking it's an MMO Skyrim. Play it enjoy it! Explore everything!! And take the time to read the books!! Not my type of game. I like team based play. And while this game has it. It is not intergral to play the game like a team. Great game This game sucks so bad. I have played all the other elder scrolls games and liked them. Their stories were really in depth and thought out. This game feels like it was made so you could just play online with others and the story is a secondary issue. I've been playing Elder Scroll games for years, and this one is by far my favorite. Sometimes their is nothing more rewarding after coming home from work and escaping to a different world to relieve stress. Each time you play is different. My favorite thing sometimes is the interaction with other people online. When you get to bigger cities in the game it's hilarious to hear some of the conversations people have. SUPER NERDS! I take that title too sometimes. You begin to feel a part of the world at times. A large sense of accomplishment comes at times as well. Playing with other people you know will bring nothing but joy! Thanks Bethesda! This is a fun game if you're into MMORPGs. The graphics are nice, and it's a good game to play if you have a lot or a little bit of time to game. Yes, it is an MMO and there are other players running around everywhere, but it is not really much of a distraction. In fact, it is nice to have the help every once in a while. The game play is fun, the story is engaging, and here is a massive amount of content. The voice chat thing is a little annoying, I don't really like that environmental resources are first come first serve, and the story starts like the other ES games where you are in some way the chosen one. It is harder to believe when there are hundreds of other chosen ones running around you. Otherwise, I am having a great time with the game. After the first month, I could finally log in to create a character.  I guess because by then everyone else stopped playing because they were bored with it already.  As much as I played Skyrim, I still find Skyrim to be vastly more interesting and entertaining.  This game is just boring.  I wander around aimlessly and pick things up for people.  The missions or more like chores and busywork; so repetitive and pointless.  There's an incentive to spend real money on crowns in the hope that you can buy something more interesting, which I'm glad I'm not stupid enough to do.  I already was dumb enough to pay full price for the game.  I got so board that I starting a killing spree.  Skyrim had depth and intricacies that ESO isn't even close to.  Not to mention the graphics are slightly worse than Skyrim.  I know we should never trust a trailer to show real gameplay, but there was a hope that the XBone would give something more than what the 360 did. Not my forte. Too much of the same. Son loves it", "Game is just ok but couldn't beat the price, Im happy Incredible game! Has a great story, intricate combat and stealth system, top-notch voice acting, and is perhaps on of the best incarnation of batman that I have ever witnessed. Get this game now!!! Best Batman game to date. Highly recommend.", "Thank you the controllers are awesome great Almost caught on fire! Nuff said.", "Great system.  Great look.  Destiny is a fun game, but is such a grind. I'm addicted to this game!  PS4 has some awesome uses that I haven't even played with and probably never will!  Great machine!  I play games...that's what I use it for!  And I play a LOT! Love PS4. Only wish it had bigger HD!!!!!", "Too tight fell apart and mic broke These are great for the price sound is solid eat padding is comfy great buy Good product Mine busted...the wire tore from the headset...had them under a year...want to say around 5or6 months...kind of disappointed...but they were pretty good...so I guess Ill re buy them ...smh...wish they could have lasted a bit longer though Good Bought the Black ops 2 edition of this, lasted two months then it fell apart. I don't recommend these headphones", "Amazing!!! Great Stick, nice artwork, layout is really nice and comfortable. Easy to make modifications and carry around, I made some modifications and it came out nicely.", "I'm a fan of AC and I've played every game until 100% completion (or close to it). That is until I got Unity.  Like many AC fanboys, I got this game out of sheer loyalty to the series, and the only thing I feel good about is that I didn't pay the full price for it.  Even getting it at $20 is still much, because then you have the problem of slogging through this beast of a game.  First off, this game is massive, and not in a good way.  Oddly enough the campaign is the shortest of any of the AC games, and just as forgettable.  What is amazing is the insane amount of side quests you are given to play.  That would be cool if they where all fun, but a lot of them are like just going though the motions.  There are 30 &#34;companion missions&#34; where all you do is run a ways and then just kill some random dude.  Such fun.  Some of them are interesting like the murder mysteries, but most of them are a chore to play.  Side missions should be what they are, not 80% of the freaking game!  You can do Co-op missions, and they are okay, if you actually get paired with someone doesn't run off and let you do all of the fighting.  Even after all of the patches, I still get game crashes, character freeze ups, and wonky controls.  The controls feel the worst of any AC game.  Trying to navigate Arno in stealth positions is annoying to say the least, and negates the best thing AC had to offer, and that was stealth play.  In this game you move a little bit, get spotted and just slug it out 8 dudes.  Seriously, that's the game.  The graphics where outstanding, you could easily fall in love with moving about the city.  Also, the customizing Arno was the best part of the game.  All of the color options, and trying on different parts of armor kept this game tolerable.  I really liked the detail in the belts, braces, hoods etc.  I don't recommend putting any more than 20-25 hours into this game.  I finished the campaign, about 50% of the side missions, and just said screw it.  This game showed to me that the series has officially run it's course.  A real shame, because this was a good series, but this is what happens when greedy game companies have to shell out half-assed games every year, instead of 2-3 years.  It's because fanboys like me will still by games out of loyalty.  Well no more. Awesome! Without friends to make a club. Or the ability to find a club. The game is lacking Exelent Very tedious. This game just makes me angry when I play it.It has game play issues for example when  I jump on things when I just wanted to run straight ahead. The &#34;boss&#34; in sequence 7, memory 3 was the last straw for me. They had you mash the circle button over and over, and I could not defeat the stupid Bellec. I don't mind a challenge when I play a game, but I want to have fun. I have played all the Assassins Creed games, and this is the first one that I do not recommend. I bought and played this game some 6+ months after its initial release and actually found it very enjoyable with most of the major glitches now patched.  Obviously, Ubisoft is still a money-grubbing corporation that should be ashamed of releasing an incomplete game.  But for people that got the game upon its release and gave up due to the glitches, I would suggest giving the game a second shot.So here are the pros and cons in easy to read bullet point:Pros:* Lots of different things to do: Like most of the Assassin's Creed games, there are lots of side quests and little things to occupy your time between story missions.  I actually thought the murder mysteries and the Nostradamus puzzles a fun departure from the regular beat-them-up side quests.* Eagle Vision becomes more useful: Up until this game, I've never really had to use much Eagle Vision asides from finding Glyphs and because the games told me to.  With more enemies and the ability to go inside buildings and underground, Eagle Vision becomes more important in knowing where enemies are.* Multi-player missions are a challenge: I confess that I played all the multiplayer missions as a single player (I don't play well with others).  And yes, single player is an option that you can access through the world map.  The ones where you have to remain undetected for highest level of reward can be frustratingly fun.* Graphics are an improvement: The city of Paris looks beautiful here.  The cut scenes are also vast improvements over previous games where the characters just look plain terrible and their lip movements often don't match the sound.* Better economy system: The game does a good job of not giving you too much money too fast.  I thought that was actually an issue with previous games where you have so much money that you can buy all the gear you want plus all of Rome halfway through the game.  With the different level treasure chests, there are actuallya good amount of money that you won't have access to initially so it forces you to make trade offs between improving your theater (which will slowly give you more money) or buying gear.  It also helps that the top level gears are very expensive.  Even at the end of the game, I cannot afford all the available gears and their upgrades.Cons:* Boring story: The major players in the plot are all so interchangeable.  One old white French guy look like all the other old white French guys.  **spoiler** And at some point in the story, Arno is kicked out of the Assassin order but then it seems like it was never brought up again and he went on being an Assassin **end spoiler**  Even though I recently finished this game, I can't tell you what the story actually was about.  Something about helping his Templar childhood best friend avenge her father?* Terrible character movements: Upon first playing Arno, I felt his movements to be incredibly clumsy when compared with Altair, Ezio, or even Connor.  The controls felt unresponsive and trying to get Arno through a window can be super frustrating while trying to be stealthy.  For a game where probably 95% of getting around is by climbing and jumping, having unresponsive controls makes the gameplay pretty unenjoyable.* Messy, complicated menus: It was difficult for me to figure out how to navigate the in-game menus.  During the Nostradamus puzzles, it would be nice if the clue stayed somewhere on screen or is easily accessible some way.  To this day, I don't have a clear idea of how to access those clues except by looking through several screens of menus.  Same goes for any option to quit a mission.  I had to look that up online.So my conclusion is that this is a pretty fun game.  The missions and side quests are enjoyable and the graphics look nice.  The most frustrating thing about it is probably Arno's movements and how unresponsive the controls are.  I typically don't care a lot forstories, so having a boring story doesn't hurt my opinion of the game too much.  I just wished I knew who I was killing and why. Best place to buy video games but the game it self had was ok best game ever", "After getting two defective ones from another vendor, this one works good.  I can only compare this to the Microsoft xbox360 wheel and this one makes that seem like a toy.  Force feedback is strong when used with project cars on the ps4.  I've also used this with drive club on PS4 and Gran tourismo on PS3, but the FFB is not near as strong with those games.Only complaint-the FFB weakens when the wheel gets hot (known issue) which is noticeable during longer races.  Once it cools down, the strength comes back.  Overall, very happy with the wheel. Great item", "Excellent!! Good Excellent This game is horrible. The graphics are s***ty. I wouldn't buy this again if it were a dollar. IS HARD, EXCELLENT", "I love being able to control my sim at their jobs in this, although the days are usually too short to complete th daily goals, you can continue them the next day. It seems as if it takes longer to get promoted, but i could be wrong. Also the retail store is cool but very hard to make money although i guess that makes sense This is a good game that will be even better when hey add pets and seasons to it. Overall I like this EP but I barely use it to be honest.This game gives you the ability to follow your sima to work through the new professions Erich is exciting but also very unmanageable if you have more than one sim in your household.So basically I don't use it. EA is pushing its developers to churn out content while ignoring identified issues in the software.Since March (which may be the release date), there have been reports of the bakery/retail issues being acknowledged by EA but remaining unfixed.  This has significantly impacted gameplay.The two that I've experienced so far (in August) are:1)  Employees are not checking out customers.2)  Customers will not buy from the warming case or lice freezer case.The impacts are that you need to either work harder or pull someone from your home to help with the shop and two, more significantly, is that you can't keep customers in the store to eat their goods and spend more time.A traditional display case is used which keeps it preserved long enough to sell most of the time or traditional tables.With Sims 3 and 2, significant game playing bugs were corrected within a month or two.. or three.. but we're almost at 6 months and major bugs aren't being addressed while content is being parsed out for maximum $$ as quickly as possible.This change in direction is sad and it's significantly impacting the quality.", "Awesome! I don't normally write product reviews, but since this one is all over the map I figured I'd share my experience.  I almost didn't purchase this item because of some of the negative reviews mainly talking about how bad it was to play Zelda:OOT.  I have to say that I am glad that I purchased this controller.  Recognized immediately in Win7. Set up was a breeze in Project64 2.1.0.1.  I have tried it (so far) with Ocarina of Time, Goldeneye (first level) and Super Mario 64 (first level).  The controller works exceptionally well.  As for the bad reviews...perhaps Retro-Bit's quality control is lacking in some aspects and those were the unfortunate people that got bad devices.  At any rate, for the most part, any inexpensive, Made in China electronic device isn't going to be a pristine, 24k gold, heavy duty, beat the game for you device.  From unboxing, to playing Zelda perfectly fine in less than 5 minutes.  Don't expect absolute perfection and you'll be happily playing your favorite N64 games on your PC. Item is fine. After a couple of uses a button got a bit sticky/hard to push but other than that great controller. Classic controller. Sometimes the analog stick my get slightly detached but it fits back in perfectly. That issue is rare though and has only occurred with 1 of my 4 controllers.", "Worked great with the original wii Works great with the racing games....lots of control when used with the Remote Plus....added action.....price of wheels is inexpensive and really adds to the game...hope you enjoy it as much as I do", "great it's a little loose fitting, but works great nonetheless Simple design and efficient. Provides some extra grip and minor protection. A little loose in some areas, but does the job.", "This really made my kids happy.  Works good, but not highest quality. One of the ports broke early on, but the rest have been fine for a while. The cord is a little short but this is a really handy adapter to have. I would highly recommend it.", "Excelente! First game was not working but contacted the dealer and they replaced it with no problems. Too violent great game", "muy buen producto It came in on time and worked perfectly!", "It works perfectly yeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!! Smash bros forever!!!! It works, and doesn't give me problems 10/10 would game again Runs smoothly for all PC/Wii U needs, and it even works with wireless controllers! Definitely worth it for anybody who would like to play Smash Bros. for Wii U with a gamecube controller. You can boot PC or Wii U drivers separately with this particular adapter and it's very convenient if you don't have an applicable controller for PC gaming and happen to have a gamecube controller laying around. I was skeptical about buying but i tried and it works just fine. Using this and pairing it with an official Nintendo controller will render the best results. Additionally, I'd recommend using it with Dolphin, since direct support was recently added to this device. That would mean that you would use it in its Wii-U mode and Dolphin will process the input exactly like a Wii (U) would.If you're gonna use this for Super Smash Bros. Melee, you'll probably find it nice to know that no input lag is introduced when using the adapter, provided you use the aforementioned setup.That means no more callibration of trigger buttons or anything of the like. I really recommend this product. Came in the mail just fine all the ports work and I have encountered no problems Very viable alternative to Nintendo's overpriced version. Works exactly as it should, no lag or bugs whatsoever. Feels a little flimsy but it has yet to be a problem after some extended use. The ports are solid, it's just the overall frame of the adapter itself that is lightweight and feels sort of cheap. No real complaints though, this works exactly how I needed it to (For playing Smash 4 on WiiU and Project M on PC), and doesn't cost nearly as much as the official Nintendo product. Occasional (very infrequent, admittedly..) missed inputs.  Strong product overall. Works great! Works great. works for smash, all that matters The only problem is that its kinda complicated to use it on a pc. This product is amazing and is worth way more to me then the wii u version I have. There is no noticeable lag difference between both the wii u version or this one if any. The optional pc plug is super important to me as I play a lot of dolphin games. yes you can do some modding to use the official adapter on pc but this can cause interference with certain steam games. The may flash supports rumble which doesn't seem important but It's  something you miss.Pros:Pc mode (easy install + rumble support)wii u modeno lagdecent cable lengthcons:the controller cables fit a little loosely in the port but doesn't affect the game. Works very well, recommend to anyone wanting to play emulated games. Works great! Works on Wii U and PC. Better than the official Nintendo adapter. Great! Best burrito i have ever ate Working just fine and a fraction of the official version pricewise. I can't complain with this flawless product.", "Haven't had a chance to play it yet but I hear good things. I'm gonna play both KH games before 3 comes out. Everything was as described in excellent condition, very pleased! Love this game! Love the game, it has several games making it a great purchase for the money. I bought this for my grand nephew. He loves it. He said the only problems was that I didn't have the related PS games. I guess I'll be ordering moe soon.", "Love the game! Very kid friendly! Very fun to play and makes you think about how to solve some of the missions (: This game is awesome. Got it for my 7yo brother and we were both arguing over who's turn it was to play! (And I'm 22 lol) the Lego games are great and this one did not disappoint. Good. 5 and 10 year old love this game. They figured it out after about an hour or so of running around without any help. They play it on and off with other games but its one of their favorites. If you have a dinosaur lover this is a game for you =) :D", "This game exceeded my expectations.The game has the fun, nostalgic feels of Halo but introduces new concepts as far as boss fights, story mode and the player vs player. Excellent game that you will not regret purchasing! Good game to an extent.  Terrible texturing.  You will randomly get stuck on stuff and it will cause you to fail POE LVL 35 dismantling mines. Yeah. That happened. Destiny where to start what a let down", "My 6 year old loves this game. I was a little worried about him playing it. It is not scary at all. My grandon loves this game, and that's all I need to know! The game is very cool. All the Lego games are. The kids like that they get to be dinosaurs in this game", "Fun game good delivery Works perfectly and arrived 2 days ahead of schedule. Thank u", "What an awesome game!  I bought this for my 7 year old daughter, but being a lego fan and a gamer myself, I have played every minute of it right there with her.  It's accessible enough for a child to pick up and play, she even beat the game completely on her own.  But it's also deep enough and fun enough for a seasoned gamer to enjoy.  If you love lego and play video games, this one is a no-brainer! Good", "What do the following games have in common: Gears of War, Bioshock, Mass Effect?  All deserve game of the year awards.  Thief is NOT a stellar or ground breaking game.  But that does not mean it is bad.I get the feeling folks were disappointed in this game because earlier games in the series were so highly rated.  But this is my first Thief game so I had no expectations.  Got the game free with &#34;games with gold&#34; promotion.Graphics and framerate are technically good.  Artistically I disliked the lack of colors, which is a typical problem with games running the Unreal engine.  Other complaints about the graphics: lots of load screens moving through the city, textures take time to load, self shadows are poorly done.  Still, overall above average.  And I think stable framerates really help playability in fps games.I like sneaking games like Splinter Cell, Hitman, and Metal Gear Solid.  This game plays in a similar fashion, even if it is not in the same league as those 3.  Downside is that combat is not a viable option unlike in those other games.  Sniping with the bow works fine though.Exploring the city is one of the best parts of the game.  There are lots of collectibles and side missions to do.  This game should keep you occupied for quite a while (unless you get bored).Story was not compelling, nor were the characters.  I did find some bugs with characters speaking and subtitles sometimes not happening at the right time.Overall, an average game.  Nothing horrible about it, but lots of little things wrong with it.  Best for gamers who like sneaking games.  Probably worth it at a heavily discounted price (say, under $10). Excellent Game... A bit difficult but Very Good...", "Teens Loved It Working fine, but I didn't like the picture quality, not as good as Dance Central 2 in my opinion.", "Great case, fits my 3DS XL perfectly (that's what it's made for even though it might be hard to find in the description).  Soft on the bottom and top of the inside sections of the case, with the cover being semi rigid (it's like something you can still bend but you'd have to try).  It's minimal, thin, and has a nice 3DS logo on it.  Meets my needs to keep the thing unscratched and somewhat protected while traveling/having this in a bag.  You can't run a tank over it, but I don't work Oman army base, so this works great for me.  10.99 value is awesome. Great case, it also have slots for your 3ds games and the case is somewhat hard( feel like hard plastic to me). Doesn't take much space and is very handy when traveling. Kudos to Amazon for this fantastic case at a low cost. Whenever I travel I take my 3DS with me in this case. Doesn't fit the charger, but the games and DS are very snug. great fits even with NERF CASE Great Case. Fits System, several games, but not a charger.", "Very cool love the blue color Finally for MSRP price. If its more then $13, I do not think you should buy it. Scalpers tends to continue to drive up prices making it hard to find the rare ones. Product came in its original packaging but said packaging was covered in some kind of dust. The retailer i bought it from however didn't let me cancel my order so that was annoying. Other than that, it's an amiibo, it is what it is and works as it should.", "Works great, looks great. Works great! No issues! My sons favorite controller!!! I hate to give this a three star because it was so perfectly made (to me), the weight, the touch, the feedback of the bottoms, not to my favorite camouflage, but still I had to return it, BECAUSE IT JUST DOES NOT WORK WITH PCS. It says &#34;wireless&#34; but it's only wireless for the XBOX 360 console, not for PCs. Then I had to buy another &#34;Play and Charging cable&#34; for it, since I figured it said &#34;Play&#34; too, right? Again, NO! It didn't work, when you hook up you controller with your PC using the cable, you will be able to find the driver installed on your computer in you device manager, but it just didn't work, and trust me, that is not the problem of my computer, I went to the Xbox official website, they did not say it won't work, and also did not say it will, and a lot of video game forums too, and it all turned out that some of the answers given on the FAQ part on this page is just misleading. Another way for it to work with your PC is you need to buy a wireless receiver to for your computer, and then I called all the Bestbuys and all the GameStops in town, and I got the same answer &#34;No, they just don't make that anymore&#34;. Here on Amazon, you can find a bunch of them, and none of them is original, all knock-offs. If you spend a lot of time, which I do not have the patience to, you might be able to find brand new original ones, for 30+ dollars. So, think about it. nice controller, and it looks cool. Took me a big to sync it but love it..cool dude.", "Had the xo four but one side stopped working. Decided to get the seven pro this go round... Love it. Got two in fact for my husband as well. It was a great purchase. It was shipped and received real quick. Worked Great! It's awesome. My husband loves them and so do I. He gets to hear the dynamic game play and I don't have to! Played bf4 with these and they offer unbelievable sound. Very comfortable and feel very durable. They have the explosions and gunfire has so much you normally wouldn't get thru just a TV sound. Works great My kid's happy!  Works as advertised. The sound's good, and the drain on the battery isn't so bad.  It may only reduce the playtime of a fully charged controller battery by a couple hours.  The headset is kind of heavy on the head.  I still haven't gotten used to it after a month, but I was using simple headsets prior to this purchase.  The Mic is super sensitive, and you may not realize it until someone says something, but everyone can hear just about everything that is going on around you.  They can hear you hitting your buttons, a distant fan, or your AC if it's moving air in your direction.  Usually, those people that complain about it, are also using Kinect Mics which feeds back on everyone.  Other issues I had were when I had to recharge one controller and move the headset to another.  For whatever reason, even if you assign both controllers to you, if you have to switch it will unassign you from the new one and the headset with fail to work.  You maybe able to hear the game, but it mutes you completely.  You basically have to hardwire your controller to the system, reassign controller to you and update controller (even if it says it's already updated), and pull the plug to un-hardwire the controller so it flashes off and on.  For whatever reason, canceling party, chat, whatever and re-entering doesn't work.  Same thing with shutting down system and restarting or turning the controller off and on.  Even unpluging the mic and re-plugging it in won't work, which some say is a popular fix.Some may have problems with the audio settings.  Some times they seem to adjust themselves.  I've noticed it more with chat.  You'll get on and everyone will sound distant or extremely soft; when you got off the time before everyone sounded fine.  You then have to re-figure game and chat volumes, which can become a little bothersome.I also do agree with a review I saw earlier, it does make your head sweat; especially around the ears.  You'd probably want to keep your room at 74 degrees or cooler; otherwise it can get a bit uncomfortable to wear.ler; otherwise it can get a bit uncomfortable to wear. If you have a scuff you will have to improvise with another controller because the paddles get in the way.", "Nice game Just perfect It'd be a great game if it didn't freeze every time just as I got Trevor Game is great, shipping sucked my grandson enjoyed this game very much works fine", "Excelent service, package came well protected. 100% recomended. Love my amiibo Shipped fast, looks great Excellent quality, worth every penny to have great Earthbound memorabilia. Cool works with us version smash bros, my kid is happy we found this for his collection. Came in perfect condition. Thank you Paid twice as much as what the amiibos retail for in the US, but couldn't get it here so it was worth it to me because Ness is one of my son's favorite Nintendo characters. My product arrived in perfect condition. The packaging was done very well. I am very happy and satisfied with my purchase. The product price is very good.", "Excellent good as advertised Great This sucks 5 dollars to return a video game went the cost is only 18", "Thanks works great but still needs a battery.", "The art style is gorgrous but it's just an ok game. This is a hidden gem on the ps3 if you like turn based games. This was one released before trophies, but it is still a fun and challenging game.", "Works as it's meant to. Fits snug on the controller and grips the phone pretty well. Wish the phone mount folded in to be more compact when not in use. Perfect fit. Looks and works great.", "Really annoyed with the issues I had with this console. It cost $50 more than the regular edition ps4 (which was fine... I understand exclusives), and as I already own a ps4, was very excited to see that there was a Batman Arkham Knight exclusive console.I bought this and installed it, and right away it didn't work. I had to call Sony and troubleshoot it, and ended up sending it in for service... and they ended up sending me a new console after waiting 10 days. By the way, the new one Sony sent me works fine. I held off on posting this until I could get past my anger and try to seem more level-headed and eloquent, but as I type this, I am feeling a tad upset and reminded why I've been reluctant to buy electronics online. I love my collector's edition Batman PS4. The matte silver finish on the console and controller is what drew me in. Do not get me wrong, I loved the original black console, but the fact of the matter is that the gloss black HDD cover is prone to scratching. Big time. Even the slightest wipe from a microfiber cloth causes scratches. I do not understand why Sony chose to implement this type of material when they removed it completely from the PS3 slim. It is like taking a step backwards in innovation. Why Sony, why??? So in a couple of years down the road I would have to purchase a PS4 slim? Most likely.The Batman PS4 eliminates this problem and is also part of the reason why I decided to purchase this console even though I had the original black PS4. Like the consoled itself, the controller does not have any gloss. It is quite similar to the likes of the urban camo controller in terms of finish.For the fans who love Batman this is a must. For those who cannot stand the gloss on the original black PS4 the collector edition PS4 seems to be one alternative.Aside from the color the Batman PS4 is exactly the same as the original with updated internals that functions more or less as the original. Even though I paid a premium of approximately $50 for the color I am content with my purchase. It is a very stylish and classy PS4 befitting any household. NOT that good Runs smoothly without any issues in the past 4 months. Controller life doesn't last long so you'd have to charge them at least once a day. Game was great and the finish on this PS4 is amazing. Playstation all the way... Great! Trash", "Great! shetty game Would not work-----have a brand new xbox one that plays all games.....but this one won't load properly. It's very nice. Exactly what I asked for.  Game in correct box, everything working smoothly.  The game was pretty good but the product condition was exactly what I expected. very good Control giant mechs and squish people. How much more convincing do you need to buy this game? Grandkids loved it It's a very solid multiplayer shooter. Well worth it's current $20 price tag. If you have a multiplayer FPS itch to scratch while waiting for future titles, it wont hurt to try this. Its launch day price point was much too high for the amount of content, and has caused a lingering bad taste in many Gamer's mouths, but try not to let that overshadow it if your thinking of picking it up now. It's still a fun game to kick back and play few rounds after work. Awesome game and can't beat the super low price, I received the game fast and for cheaper than the downloadable version.", "\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591DURABLE\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591\u2591It's certainly durable! I bought my NES in 1988 after saving up $100 and making my mom drive me to the mall after school once night to buy it as soon as I reached $100. I played the hell out of that system all through my youthful years. (Time well spent, I might add! Turtle shells don't throw themselves, you know. Someone's got to do it.)Today I still play that very same NES I bought nearly 30 years ago with my daughter. Mario is just as big of a hit with her today as it was for me in the 80's. Not too shabby considering she has been raised in a world where high res 3D graphics are a part of absolutely everything. The console has seen better days but that was expected, it plays well though! The free game that it came with takes a lot of work to get working, as it seems to fir loosely in the system. Overall I am pleased with this product, I recommend this seller. Super clean system as specified. Thank you so much", "Sorry for the late review.  Wanted to test it out for awhile.  Game was what we ordered and it works fine.  Good buy. Good game, live play is enjoyable, was a little disappointed with the zombies mode though. Treyarch's zombies far outscore this rendition of it. This game stopped working not ever two weeks later, also another big disappointment", "Bought this for my Grandson who was delighted with it. Arrived on time in perfect condition. Pretty much the greatest controller ever made.  Comfortable, responsive, intuitive. Works great! Use it as a gamepad controller for Windows 8.1 Too bad the d-pad is godawful trash.  This would be close to a perfect controller if the designers had actually decided to design around a d-pad, instead of slapping it in a well too tall for it.  It's not as terrible as the PSP's d-pad was, but man, it is not great.  Considering that I've played, or at least attempted to play a few 2-d sidescrollers and fighting games on it, it just wasn't adequate.It misses directions. It constantly falls between cardinal directions and diagonals with little rhyme or reason.  And it feels mushy and nasty to use for any length of time.  It's like every d-pad come with soda prespilled inside of it.Which is a shame because the rest of the controller is really nice.  Solidly built, with the right amount of heft.  Feels great to hold, and all of your button and stick placement is where it should be.For your games that don't use a d-pad, its one of the best.  For all of your games that predominantly use a d-pad, you should probably just get another controller. Great controller despite the semi responsive d pad I gave this 5 stars because I got exactly what I expected.  I prefer the wired controllers because I'm sick of changing batteries.  I highly recommend this.", "Perfect for my 7 year old daughter who loves to dance and sing! Good I like it, but my daughter doesn't; she's turning into a teen and she won't do these.", "Adds more to a pretty fun game, got some interesting discs, but nothing super rare, as this is a grab bag item.

I like it", "These battery covers are just what we needed for the price.  I have two boys are break everything.  Product is still holding up so I would definitely recommend. Perfect Regular item I bought this and they do indeed look the part and fit the controller. However, my son is now asking for more as these appear to be broken now. I am rating 1 star. We had these for less than 6 months. I have two boys and these are definitely nice to have", "Good and I feel that my Xbox is safe is it Works great to hold stuff, something to note is that it does not fit the actual xbox disc cases inside Great bag! It fits my Xbox One securely and perfectly with extra room to spare for controllers and other accessories. Perfect whenever I need to carry my Xbox one around, I don't have to worry about things banging into or scratching it.", "great hmm I guess I'll start with the good. The Boss fights are unique and something different for an dynasty warriors game. The stages are well done as well. Now for all the bad. Its repetitive, really really repetitive. On every stage you have to find an item that is essential for beating a boss, blocking an area, or beating a specific enemy type. If done right it coulee been fun but the enemies are spam heavy and a chore to fight. Lastly the game is way too easy Thanks Boring so far", "great I received this product a couple years ago and forgot to leave a review. It came to me in okay condition and everything worked perfectly fine. Only complaint is that the battery life wasn't amazing, but I've had it for a while and it stills works. My son loves playing with his 3DS.  It has many great features, but be warned, there are no games with this item.  All games are purchased separately.", "Works great...plays all of my games; especially rockman and forte, and final fight guy for super  Famicom. Awesome! The controls are great! the first one arrived and it didn't work. sent a replacement and it didn't work. You cant expect much from this product Great product. Items within package were packaged well with helpful documentation for issues you might experience with your older games. While it is &#34;cheaply&#34; made it works great and the quality of the design leaves little to be desired for a generic gaming system to play your vintage games. Item came as described.  Brought back the nostalgia of being a kid!", "I am very satisfied with this item the LEDs are very bright and setting the controller to light up on vibration adds a lot of fun to your game play especially with shooters. Solid feel and looks cool and cheaper than the Microsoft brand. Can't go wrong.", "Works as intended, is a nice length. The cable feels durable but it is not stiff. I put this in my 3ds case without issue. Works with any usb power source. This cable is very handy for charging the new 3DS XL when an outlet is not available. I've used my portable charger and laptop. I haven't had any problems with it. Bought one but not working. Amazon send me a new one instead but still not working properly. The charging light on my New 3DS blinks frequently. The cord was cheaply made. Perfect cable I love it and it gives me more room to charge my stuff. [[ASIN:B0024ZT3XO Gen USB Charge Cable for Nintendo 3DS/DSI/DSIXL]]Does not work unless 3DS is in sleep mode. Tried on various chargers plugged in to the wall (Apple, Samsung, Anker, Aukey), an Anker battery pack, computers, another 3DS with stock battery. Ammeter shows amp registered through the cable is only .15 amps, or 150 milliamps.It might be fine if you're not playing it and only using to charge when you're sleeping, however, I was looking for something to use while with my battery pack while on the go to charge and play... ITTWERKS! This is a decent product, it only charges the device if its off and it charges it slowly. In an emergency when a wall charger is not available this could be handy. When the device is dying and needs a charge to keep it alive and give it life to keep going, a wall charger is a better option. Brings a modern upgrade to Nintendo's dated policy of not separating the power brick and the cord (like every single modern Smartphone). I used it on a normal 3DS and it words perfectly! Came doa, didn't have to use it until return period ended. Don't buy. Works as described. First one I received doesn't charge properly; I tried many different configurations by using my iPhone (1A) wall adaptor, my iPad (2A) wall adaptor, my laptop, my 2A travel battery use charger, etc.  Light on the 3DS XL just blinks on and off and never completes charging.  Returning.  Edit: Got a replacement, and the light doesn't blink anymore.  So this cable is better (I'm guessing for $3.99 we'll get a few badly made cables).  However, the charging light never turns off even after leaving the ds overnight on a 1A Apple iPhone charger (that was the closest thing I could find to the 900mA from a USB output).  When I look manually in the DS's settings to see its battery life, it looks like it charges fine.  As we know, continuing to charge Lithium Ion after its done charging isn't good for the battery, so I hope that's not happening when the charge light stays on.... ok", "This thing is a blast. I threw it on my sim racing rig for F1 2013, F1 2015, and various F1 style cars in other games, and the added realism as well as the excitement factor from using an F1 style wheel is just superb. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to do F1 sims or just wants a wheel with a bunch of cool buttons on it. They're all a bit easier to reach than most on my T500RS GT wheel, and the rocking paddle shifter that stays with your hands through turns is awesome. Great wheel. Would give it 5 stars if they had put actual rotary switches instead of stickers on the front, but overall, it works very well. A little overpriced, but what isn't in the simracing world?", "Awesome! Sensitive buttons and the extra long chord is great. Just what we needed and arrived quickly", "Fun. It's working great...", "excellent Do not buy this new. Used you can find them so cheap. I dont expect anyone to be using these for the xbox 360 but for mocap use. I spent 30$ on two of them used. Both of them work like a charm. If your going to spend 150$ on a depth perception camera, their are way better ones out there then this one for that ammount of money.", "Words can't really even describe how fantastic this game is.  If you like slice-of-life/dungeon crawler RPGs, this is definitely a game you have to get.  Huge variety in the personalities of the characters make them seem real.  Writing is great, and it feels like there are tons more to do in the game compared to Persona 3.  Not to mention a 40-50 hour playthrough which begs it to be played through a second time for completion-sake. Probably the best JRPG on the Vita, Recommended even if you already beat the original on the PS2, because there's so much more this time around. Im currently playing this and i must say its the BEST VITA GAME hands down.The seller shipped it fast and delievered it early even though it was standard delivery.I recomend this for you all especially if you love JRPGS. I love it. This is awesome game and probably longest ps vita game.. played for like 95hours.. i love it.. 5stars plus :D quick delivery from USA to Australia.. 1 weeks..  thanks heaps This was the one game that my friend would give a ten out of ten and it's one of five for me. Alongside Tales of Vesperia, Majora's Mask, Virtues Last Reward and Devil May Cry 3, this is one of the best games of all time. The story is immersive, the characters fun and the gameplay is the best turn-based combat there is, with the use of 1more attacks by exploiting weaknesses and random aid, like cavalry attacks and team ups. The social link system is unique, adding a purpose to interacting with the diverse and interesting side characters. If I had one criticism, it's that there is no point to aim for any ending but the Golden ending, but that's because the Golden ending is so good and most of the other endings are basically game overs with a conclusion to the story. If you like JRPGs, you already own this game. If you're wondering if this is worth buying a Vita or PSTV for, I'd say there is no better RPG on the system and definitely should lean you towards buying it.", "It took a few hours to train and it showed it's potential as a wmd from the start.

Wild give it a 5/5 but the box Came damaged. Everything I expect it to be I'll say it again: buy this Japanese import and your grandmother will never know it wasn't from the States. Came exactly as planned and is nicely packaged. Palutena is looking good on my shelf with my other Amiibo figures. This amiibo looks really lovely in person, worth buying! I ordered this for my son who collects amiibos.  He loves it and displays it.  He has already downloaded this amiibo and recommended to friends that are in search of her.  Thanks, Amazon for all the vendors through your site. The fox amiibo was FANTASTIC! As on the other hand, the Palutena Amiibo had some sort of glue in the light blue arua. Very nice!

My friends say it sounds like I'm ten feet away from my mic it's absolutely ridiculous", "Super fast shipping, works perfect. I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  There doesn't seem to be a promotion for these currently (though there should be some for Black Friday). The new designation for Console with one controller and Console with two controllers just lets you toggle between the standard bundle and the bundle with an extra new controller at about full price. You'd actually save a few buck buying separately, so I wouldn't go for any of them (I don't expect any controllers, except the Elite, to be scarce this season).  A short list of features that may interest you, shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions(I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack (excepting the Forza 6 bundle) and shouldn\u2019t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven\u2019t included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, andtriggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller has been released to wide acclaim (modifiable professional controllers can easily go for twice as much), but is scarce at present. If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.  Current bundles -  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. (I think these are being phased/sold out) I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.  Legacy bundles-  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom (new, with 3.5mm audio jack) controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4.  At this point, I think the best offer for the holidays for an X1 bundle will be for $50 off current price point, plus an extra game and second controller (Dell at least, will offer such a deal). The risk is availability and whether the bundle or extra game would be one you'd want.  Hope this was useful to you. The madden NFL 16 we downloaded and had to wait to play isn't working.  Called Amazon and had to talk to three different people who still haven't solved the problem.  I was supposed to have an email today to tell me what they are going to do to fix it.  Nothing yet.  I'm pretty unhappy.  I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon.  Maybe that needs to change. This game is so broken. Terrible, the 1TB hard drive is nice, but i still have the same problems as the other xbone models. The system looks like an 80s oversized VCR, the system overheats every 15 minutes, and the UI is ugly. Save your money and get a ps4! Exactly as expected.", "Sometimes I hold realism in the utmost importance when it comes to movies and especially videogames. I thought 3 got a little too si-fi for me and a little too unrealistic. Two was more realistic when it comes to gang warfare. I thought the gangs in 3 weren't believable I mean the Luchadors were ridiculous but,the Deckers were just completely absurd. If realism isn't that important to you then the game play is ok. Very good, exactly what I ordered Really fun fun", "works great I have a giant head (typically xxl helmet) which makes these headphones a bit uncomfortable for long-term usage. Also the removable Mic is a pain and not as good as the fixed flexible style of the turtle beaches i used with my 360. Other than that I have no complaints as far as to their function. Audio quality was good and I like that they run off the controller power. It does run down the controller battery faster but that's why I have rechargeable battery packs and a charging station. If you don't have a giant noggin and aren't picky about your Mic it's a buy.", "Good. Works great, easy to install and the price was right. Works great! Excellent product and seller! Works Very good", "It works as advertised. I got these glasses as a birthday present for my 15 year old brother. He loves them! They have a smooth fit that allows him to wear his glasses and headphones with ease. Also, his eyes get less tired when playing video games or just browsing through YouTube. Overall, good product. The frame is very cheap , I expected a little more for a 70 dollar pair of glasses. On the other hand It has served its purpose , headeache frequency and eye tiredness has lowered.", "did the job for my sons xbox 360. Best deal i found online and works great. Works fairly well. The official xbox works better, but this thing is nice if you don't have the official or want a second one for some reason. Or even if you don't have the original anymore it serves it's purpose fairly well.", "Was fun to play for about an hour..then it got boring and repetitive. Subpar demo of a game As a long time video game golfer, I am a long time player of EA golf games, going all the way back to the Sega Genesis PGA TOUR III.In recent years, the Tiger Woods labelled offerings got really good and had a massive online following.This game will see the end of all that.Now, I should have known before I ever bought a copy.  I happened to be out of town for a few weeks when this came out.When I got back from my trip, I wanted to get a copy and get back to golfing with my friends from the old TW13 / 14 Country Club.I was pretty surprised to see so many low priced copies on Amazon.  Less than 2 weeks after release, there were copies for $40 on Amazon.So I grabbed one, wondering why so many were flooding the market with their recent $60 purchases.Well, no alt shot, no country clubs AT ALL, very few courses and the general sterile / bland feel of this game have me understanding why people were dumping this title so fast, and for so little.  It is a surprisingly weak effort after going more than 2 years between releases.There are always promises of more courses around the corner, and they have dished out Scottsdale, but that still keeps the course total in the single digits.  Granted, there are a few pretend courses, but honestly, if we wanted to keep playing pretend courses in a low feature game - we would still play The Golf Club instead of shelling out more money for this.  Even at a low price, I over-paid for this game.In summary, I am positive I have wasted more money on less useful things over the course of my life, so not looking to rant on minutia, but this was a pretty disappointing effort on the part of EA Worst golf I have played in a long time. Glad I did not buy.  I played through the free trial on Xbox One today. Was really excited about it and no buy.", "Good one. Typical Xbox controller. Nothing special to say that everyone doesn't already know. Wonderful, my friend goes through controllers, so I get him one a few times a year. I'm please with my order It was complicated but we figured it out This is a great controller. It has a great feel and I use it almost daily to play many different games on my xbox 360. I personally love it because it has a smooth feel to it and I can't even explain how awesome the experience is if you are playing an immersive game like Call of Duty or Halo. Also, I think that the battery life is great. It uses 2 AA batteries and it lasts about 2 months for me, and I use it almost everyday for about 2 hours. It also is a great material and it does not damage or get smudges easily. The only downside is that it is pretty costly, but it is well worth the price if you buy it. Perfect. Perfect! it is what it is. It functions fine, but these controllers break down quickly. Somehow, I've already replaced it 3 different times...and all three times for the same reason. Clicking the joysticks makes the internal parts break down quickly. Once worn, the joystick will stick constantly. The obvious implications for driving and shooter games show why the constant need to replace it rather than just suffer through. Since the non-xbox options are pretty limited, one deals with the hassle. I bought this cuz my other controller took a crap. This one is still running strong nice D pad does not work well. Have to shift the hat around to get the buttons to press properly on it. Seems like the hat was a little too big so I would have to slide it up to get the down directions to clear the case body. Then slide it back down again to use the up direction. Rest is fine. It's an xbox controller.  What more can I say.  My old one was well worn and the sticks would cause drift to one side, so I bought a new one.  It has that fresh clean smell and I had forgotten that the sticks actually had a texture to them since I had worn it off of my old ones. item is in perfect condition, my boys loved it! Works perfectly.", "Great game. Great game. I CANT REALLY GIVE ANYTHING LOWER THAN 5 STARS", "The headset has worked well for me and has good audio quality for the price. In fact, I would have given it five stars if I had reviewed it sooner. However, I recently noticed cracks in the plastic headband near the ear pieces. Yesterday, one ear piece actually broke off when I put it on. Fortunately, the wire was still in tact and they still work. Please note that there was no accident or incident that caused this. It was simple, normal wear. I have patched it up with electrical tape, but when I invest in a replacement, it will definitely not be another set like this. Waste of money. I purchased these as open box through another site. However, I need to write this review-these headsets are amazing! Bass is incredible and it's nice having the separate dials for sound and game/chat volume balance. Mic is clear as well.I just wanted to say that these can be used on the xbox one, in case you're wondering. All you will need is the microsoft stereo headset adapter. Plug in your controller via the usb cable and keep the headset just plugged into the 3.5 jack on the adapter. They work on pc flawlessly.As for the sound, I prefer them over the px21 earforces that broke on me, as well as the x11's that broke. These are much sturdier, physically, and you can't beat that they're wireless. If they do for some reason have some internal wiring probs, pdp makes it easy on you by enabling easy disassembling. There are 3 screws beneath the foam earcups that lead to the wiring, which can be easily soldered yourself if need be. With that in mind, both pairs have held up nicely with daily usage for over a year.", "Great! Very cool!Much better than pushing buttons on guitarhero style games.Actually, I believe this is the perfect evolution of those kind of games. Not the be all to end all.  It did, however spark a real interest in learning how to play the guitar.  I started online lessons shortly after determining this game would not do that for me, and am still going strong.  A couple of the practice games are ok, but I don't see how this product will truly teach you how to play the guitar without some more formal training.", "best strategy game along with starcraft brood war This is a game I have lived forever and I will continue to love.", "this was surprize so many puzzles ive ever seen in game great konami game Game will remind you of the original classic &#34;Resident Evil&#34; but the programmers failed to rid this version of its countless glitches.

Apparently, it is finicky about USB ports which causes the weird centering problem people complain about. Anyway, tried another USB and all the problems went away. It doesn't feel cheap, which is good for someone that breaks everything like me. I really wanted the 3 pedal Logitech wheel, but the price was too good on this. Compliments to Amazon for delivering a day early on Sunday. Nice wheel.

Highly recommend Fantastic controller, and it's longer than the original Melee cables which is nice Excellent Got here fast. Awesome product. Love it. Great controller. Feels solid in every way.The only negative aspect about is that the L trigger get stuck if you press at an angle. I've seen several complaints regarding this, but none before I bought mine, so I figured I'd mention that so that future buyers will know. As good if not better than the original gamecube controller. It's a really well packaged and works like a regular controller. Great!", "Works perfectly.  Had no problems since transferring it and using theb360 brick. Very cheap option. I have even bought a couple of them since and they work great. A used Xbox 360 power adapter is 7.99 at gamestop and is way cheaper than buying even a generic one brick Works as advertised so far.  Turned out I had a Slim power supply for my xbox 360.  Not a big deal, as you can pick up a used 360 fat power supply from Gamestop for about $25.  The combination is inexpensive, silent, and as close to OEM as possible without it being specific for the one.  The 360 PS additionally recognizes the Xbox One status as did my original ONE power supply going from an orange to green light when powered.", "I'm an 8 year old boy making this review and i don't like this company Activision.

Fast Shipping.", "We love our play station and controller are brand new. It's great for the kids. This version of Sony's PlayStation 3 console is compact, sleek, and even stylish. As a casual gamer, this game system is satisfactory, such that it's 500 GB hard drive is more than enough to store my game data, videos, and music. It's super slim design makes for easy placement anywhere in my home where there's a TV. Plus, it is said to use less energy than it's preceding version, the PS3 slim version usually holding an average 250 GB. It shows, as older models tend to fire off like a heating system or an air conditioner after moderate to heavy use. There are no signs of the console burning out, even after several hours of gameplay. (Note: extend the longevity of your game system by not using it so often, you all know the drill.) I keep some space open around my console so it doesn't overheat. The price of the console when I bought it reflected well for my budget too, as I saw it as less than a dollar for every gigabyte storage in the console's hard drive. All in all, if you want the ultimate gaming experience without paying an arm and a leg for the newer PS4, buy this PS3. Even with changes in its design -- there is a hatch covering any inserted game disc that can be opened by pressing the eject button adjacent to the power button on the front -- the console functions in the same capacity as its older models. Some may see this as a downgrade from what is featured with the older models, but it's really of no consequence to me. It enhances that DVD/Blu-Ray kind of feel for me when inserting discs into the the console. Good price for a good device, and well worth the investment\u2026 if it doesn't burn out and experience that yellow light of death often seen with the &#34;fat&#34; models. Very Nice\ud83d\udc4d THE PS3 is a good machine, but the only problem is that some games free and you have to re boot the power Excelente. Tons of memory space and ease of access. it was quick to set up and very efficient in run time. Excellent Came waaaaaay faster than expected! Works great, though, i was hoping the controller would be wireless as the description clearly stated, but oh well. Great system, great price!", "Great system.  Love the color and look of it.

Awesome, shipment sent to deliver 4-5 days, came in two! Easy sale, arrived as promised. It came perfectly the best amiibo I every got since it came perfectly As advertised.", "Really great quality discs and box!! I adore the entire Metal Gear series (except for the first two games in the 80s/1990).  This game is great...awesome story (very believable, too), great cutscenes (terrible graphics, but that's how it was for the time), and ok combat.  I had to take off one star for the following reasons:1)  The combat.  It's just ok...sometimes the controls stick and it's tough to get up from a crawl and Snake sometimes backs up against walls you didn't mean him to back up onto.  The aiming can take a bit to get used to as well.2)  You will die....A LOT....the game is not very easy on the &#34;easy&#34; setting either.  The worst part is that you have to go through all the cutscenes again if you die during a boss encounter.  Very, very annoying.and lastly,3)  The Psycho Mantis battle is AWFUL, but only if you got this game off PSN on the PS3.  The controller port switching doesn't work at all, and it takes a good half hour or so to kill him.  You'll find the battle to be very frustrating because of this.  I don't understand why this happens, but after performing a search for the issue online, it's clearly well documented.  I don't know why they haven't fixed it.In any case, the game deserves 5 stars for setting the benchmark for all future games to follow it, but the above concerns are worthy of a 1-star deduction.", "Great product and fits perfectly with the description. Perfect I've had this charger for over a year with two remotes. It works great. Just stick the remote in and it charges as expected. There are no cables or issues guiding in so it will sit just right. I thought the plastic may be too light duty, but so far OK. It has some spring/give to it. The controller stack, so shelf space real estate needed is kept limited which is nice.The only negative thing I can possibly say about it after a year is that the LED charge lights may be too bright for some places. I'm not sure I would want it in my bedroom, or right next to my TV as it could be distracting. Take this into consideration before you get/use it. They make a nice night light in my living room, so I actually find the LED's to be a benefit.The only improvement I can think of would be a 'gas gauge' on how far along the charge is, 25%, 50%, etc. Works exactly as described. I am always a little skeptical with products like this that use rechargeable batteries but I have noticed that each battery holds a longer charge than normal batteries. The charging station is sturdy and the red/green lights are very convenient. If you are a regular gamer like I am than you definitely need this! I've had this product for about 3 weeks now, and I just had to put a warranty claim on the product; because it was defective the day I got it.  I tried troubleshooting it and seeing if certain accessories were creating too much drain on the batteries.  After testing, I'm sure the batteries are okay, but the charging station itself is defective.  The charging stand was giving the \\\\\"green light\\\\\" for being full charged, when it was only, at best, slightly over half charged.  Product details state you should be getting about 40 playable hours with two fully charged battery packs (which are provided in the purchase).  After the initial charging, I may have gotten 10 hours of play time between both batteries combined.  I did have a Turtle Beach Headset plugged into the controller; but without it, I may only get between 12-14 hours between two fully charged batteries.  I bought this product because I was sick and tired of the plug-and-play chargers constantly breaking within 6 months to a year from purchase, and my battery pack (which I had for a year), was down to 10-12 hours per full charge,  So, even after a year of use and using a Turtle Beach Headset, the old battery was lasting almost twice as long.  I don't think the problem is with the batteries that are included with this product, it's something with the charger indicating that the batteries are fully charged and discontinuing the charging after the light turns green.  That part of the product is defective.  This wouldn't be a problem, if I could just hook the controller up to a USB (like you can with most of rechargeable battery packs for XBox One) to charge.  I've tried it, and all it does is plug the controller to the system, and doesn't charge it at all.  You have to use the quick charge station in this package, because the way the battery is designed and how it changes the charging port from the top plug-in potion of the controller to the bottom of the battery cover.  Right now I have a ticket in on the Performance Designed Products webpage, [...], which is where you have to put all your warranty claims and report or get help with any problems you are having with your product.  It was inconveniently marked in the fine print on the bottom of the box.  Also, for those who think they might need an instruction manual for how to operate it, there is none.  It just eludes to, on the box, that \\\\\"Red\\\\\" light means charging, and \\\\\"Green\\\\\" light means fully charged.  It's simple to figure out, but I know some people are going to want instructions of some sort.    Update: I've had 4 replacement batteries sent, and a new charger.  I'm still getting only about 5-7 hours from any of the batteries after full charging them on this charger; and the stand is the only way to charge their special batteries.  Also it takes a little over 2 hours to fully charge these batteries off the stand, which makes the fact I'm only getting 5-7 hours of play time is pretty unsatisfactory. It still only shows as slightly more than half charged when you check the batteries status, after \\\\\"fully\\\\\" charging them, on the XBox dashboard.  So it's either false advertisement that we're supposed to get about 40 hrs of play time between the 2 battery packs included, or they're not inspecting the merchandise when they leave the factory.  I'm just going to get another plug and play with rechargeable battery the next time I need to replace batteries.  The battery on that last about as long, probably longer, then the two battery packs included in this package combined.    Update: They've sent me 4 replacement batteries, and replaced the charging stand.  Still does not work as advertised.  Batteries are still charging halfway to 3/4 (even when it says fully charged) and still only giving 5-7 hours instead of the advertised 20 hours.  Not to mention, only used some of the replacements once, and now 5 of the total 6, that I received from the original purchase and replacements, will not charge at all on the charger stand.  Thisis absurd.  It's beyond incompetence and I can't even imagine it stands to measure up to even the lowest standard of quality. This device works perfectly, charges very quickly, and batteries hold a decent charge.  While not the same capacity as using alkaline, the benefits outweigh that one small down side.  The unit is simple to use and even my 4 year hold has no issue putting the controls on and taking them off the charger.  It some ways it may seem a little flimsy, but has been holding up well. Works great. Much better than having to buy batteries all the time.  The green charging light is quite bright, luckily we don't sleep in that room. I wanted to buy this product because I have heard good things and read good reviews about it. I wanted to cut down on battery use and go with a rechargeable pack. Reading the description of this product I was convinced I had found the right one. After using it I noticed even after a full charge, the battery life is still only at 75%. The battery life itself only last for me at least 10-15 hours compared to the 40 hours it promised. Don't make the mistake with buying this product.", "I love this game!!!!!

If you are a Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball GT fan you would be crazy not to buy it. My only advice to buyers is get a new disk because mine has a big scratch but not lethal scratch. the game was great until the story is beaten. i kno the main thing is the online features but everyday dragonball z game from really old always had 2 players or more(not online im talking actually with 2 controllers) the 2 player sucks on here thats the only flaw&#62;&#60; oh and healing with capsules during a vs battle The product came as described and in great condition.

I like how easy it is to drop on/out. The game sucks I have played Elder Scrolls on my Mac and playing this version on my PS4 hooked up to my 4K TV (with upscaling) it ROCKS!!!

Let's face it, there are A LOT of Assassin's Creed games! My game shelf was over flowing so I decided to clean things up a bit, therfore, I sold my &#34;AC2-Reveleations&#34; games to purchase this set. It's cheaper and more convenient than buying each game separate for the new buyers! I guess the only thing I'm surprised were not included were the Expansion Packs/DLC for each game. These are NOT new games so I am somewhat surprised that Ubisoft continue to make players pay for these old expansion packs. Was a lot of fun hard to rate all three games in on though", "Quick and as stated. Can I rate this no stars?  No game controller included, disk drive doesn't work/open and there is a lot of wear and tear on the system.  Also, the system sounds like it's about to crash and burn. In the end, do not waste your time or money to purchase this system (from IOT) only to have to return it for a full refund.  Note to Amazon Fulfillment: throw the system in the trash as soon as you receive it back. The xbox360 worked for a month or so then stopped. Sometimes it comes on but you are unable to put your password in. Other times it doesn't come on at all. This console came without a power cord. It would have been nice to KNOW that as I had a 7 year old waiting impatiently for it to arrive and could have purchased a power supply at the same time. and it has no controller. and now that i try to put in a game it wont read the brand new disk.", "its okay, but i hate driving in games Very good game! This game, omg this game! I'd been wanting this game for a long time now, but wanted to wait till I got the PS4 so I'd have more games on it.(Since I already has so many on PS3). I had gotten it since I was going to be going out of town to my Aunt's house, who doesn't have great internet(or really any at all).My mom said I could take it with me since we'd be there for a long time. I never ONCE turned on the PS3 or used any other games what so ever. I love this game so much, it's one of the best open world games I've played in a long time. At one point I was just like to hell with the story! My mom, dad, aunt, just everyone in my family that was there started playing. We just had a ton of fun driving around, since none of use were any good at it. The story is okay, could had been better. But it's a ton of fun I honestly which some of the Assassin's Creed games were like this.I hope Ubisoft makes another Watch Dogs, just even for the fact I can just drive around blowing stuff up.While playing this game, it was the most I'd seen my dad laugh in along time.All in all, great game, good game play, rather easy controls. Rent it. Don't buy. The graphics are good, and the hacking ability is fun for a week. The plot was so boring and irrelevant that I've already forgotten it. good thanks for selling me a m-17 game and I am only 13.", "It doesn't deserve the hate it recieves. It's not as good as other Battlefields but it's still a great time with good ideas. Definitely better than Hardline... no what I expected, but it is still a great game", "Yep Great Maybe it's just me but the open world format was too confusing comparing to the previous games. I also disliked the new visual style which even though is high quality, was drab for me. I prefer the brighter colors of the previous iterations where the path and markers are easier to spot. I gave up on the game after a few attempts, didn't grasp enough of my interest to play through it.", "good was great not worth a dollar if you already have the first 1 or 2. all the UFC games are exactly the same. very good", "Exactly as described. Fit 3DS fine. Thank you! awesome styluses. they fit in my regular 3ds and they are stiff, so when you extend them out they stay extended. the package was so hard to get open, took me 20 mins. i could have used scissors, but i was determined to do it by hand. great product. arrived real quick, there are colours, they extend, they fit our 3DS's, just what I wanted.", "Can't complain, product as described. Glad there is such a product since our wii's went out. works great great battery ..", "I will get the negative out of the way first:1. Reuse of dungeon maps is so frequent that I can't just give the game a pass for being fun.2. Like Mass Effect (all of them), I kept saying to myself, &#34;Why on earth would you say that??&#34; This was not a deal breaker, and it was not overly frequent, but it happened enough that I felt compelled to mention it.3. I would have liked to have had more mention of the character from Dragon Age Origins, especially if that character was a mage.4. Way too many blood magickers, and it seems that all you have to do to become a blood mage is to get angry and slit your wrist while posing, spraying out more blood than a human body can realistically hold.Now, positives:1. This game is beautiful! The graphics are a huge improvement over Dragon Age: Origins and awakening, which I had no complaints about.2. Your character has a voice! And a darned good one at that! He sounds a bit like Obi Wan Kenobi's big brother if you play the male Hawke.3. Combat for the console is much improved, faster paced, and more fluid.I had fun with this game from beginning to end. As a longtime Dungeons and Dragons player, this game reminded me of some of the very brilliant city and town settings that I have played in years past, and perhaps that's why I liked it. I really enjoyed dealing with the factions and balancing the various personalities of the game.This game proves that you don't need to top your big bad ultimate villain from the previous game just to have a decent sequel. This game was not as immersive as it's predecessor, and the story is more linear, but it has a very high fun factor.If you like a wide open game world, like Skyrim or The Witcher, then you'll be disappointed. You spend a lot of time in town. Personally, I enjoyed this; but if you don't, and if you want a wide open game world, then this probably is not the game for you. Downgrade from Origins, but a nice little standalone game, a must play if you want to invest alot of time into Inquisition", "This game has definitely the best game play of the 3, leading to awesome,  incredible missions,  and it has some oddball missions with gameplay that are totally unlike any of the other one. But there are four glaring faults that make this game terrible...1) The story is just terrible.  I won't go further into detail as to why,  I'll just say after 2 games of setting this all up, you'll find yourself disappointed with the outcome. All those important decisions you made in the last 2 games become nothing more than a number in my next fault.2) There's this thing called galactic readiness. It's a number.  The whole point of the game is to just get the number as high as you can. The only way to get it high is by performing some incredibly boring tasks. Including...3) Multi-player. Which is just a boring,  repetitive horde mode. I'd say it would be a great new addition to the game,  but if you want to complete single player with any sort of positive outcome, you have to play multilayer.  A lot. Because of another number.  A percentage. It's the percent of the first number you try to get that you actually get.  The only way to raise it,  is to play multi-player. And it's impossible to get that number high enough without multi-player.4) This goes back to story kind of, but the biggest flaw is that you really only get half of the single player. Everything in the games story is bare bones  A lot of it is included in about $50 of DLC. Like so much of the story is wrapped up in it,  characters even reference events that happen in the main game.  If you're going to sell me something,  sell me the whole thing.  Not part of it,  then all the other parts separately. If you have time I recommend purchasing mass effect 1, 2 and 3 because it was a great story that provides a different perception on life. It is also a great game, although in the 2nd one you have to farm a lot for upgrades. But overall one of the best series i played and choice your decisions wisely...", "Received very quickly.

Its worth the money. Only problem I've encountered is that I /have/ to turn my ps4 and the PGE on at almost the same time, which really isn't a big problem at all.", "great I suppose the problem of Sony Santa Monica pumping out so many God of War titles is clearly present in this game; they put so much story and mythos into the other games, that there was nothing left for this game. It's hollow and feels spiritless. Where GoW I, II, (and half of) III were soaked in story and oozed frustration, rage, sorrow, regret, loss, and sadness, &#34;Ascension&#34; is just simply going through the motions (never played the PSP games, although I'm sure they were better than this). You're Kratos. You rage. You smash people. Game end.The enemies this time were the lamest I have ever seen. These are mostly the same enemies, but now they have become either &#34;elementals&#34; or use elements in their attacks. Also, why would the medusa's now change their look, when they were set -in stone- (ha, ha, yeah ok) before hand? Why give those insufferable Talos elemental attacks now, when this was a backstory? Why the hell is Ganesha in Greece and so pissed off at me?! Why is this green stiletto-wearing woman from Cirque du Freak spitting poison at me?!...AND what is that hand creature? Where is that in Greek mythology?This game focused more on face-to-face combat with bosses, instead of the interesting and cool ways to take them down. So you're sitting there for up to thirty minutes to take down two people. Ridiculous. It's not a challenge, it's lazy writing and gaming.Also, the narration in this game is barely if ever present. Kratos is unlike himself not yelling at things every other scene. With him silent, it really becomes half-hearted and something akin to just playing with toys.The Fates are more annoying than they are daunting. The boss battles with them are again, some of the lamest I have seen in a long time. Half the time you want to just smack them away like an pesky fly, instead of &#34;...Oh holy...I HAVE TO FIGHT THAT?!&#34;While this game does have beautiful scenery and you're fighting alongside some of the best hits of God of War's soundtrack, this is merely Kratos with so many colors he looks like he's at a techno rave. Kratos is given elements for his weapons, but they serve no real purpose except for minor gimmicks to temporarily halt the enemies. You don't even really need them, as most bosses only respond to non-magical attacks and just actual blade hits.By the time the most awesome battle comes, the game is over in less than a few minutes. A giant and epic fight, reduced to a few quick button timed events. Tragic.This is proof they only made this game for more money. Again, lazy writing and game-making.Borrow it, don't buy it.

This game takes place before Kratos killed Ares or any God, while he was a man still bonded to Ares. This is my favorite game of all time. It is difficult, but yet no so much that you cant enjoy playing it. This with all of the other versions of Game of War are just amazing.  Missing out if you have not tried this series!! great and cool game", "A lot of stickers but they don't fit perfectly. Very happy with these. 30 lightbar stickers on one sheet, stick perfect, and look pretty sweet. hubby like them a lots Awesome little stickers. They just barely cover to the edges of the light so you need to get it on there perfectly, but it's not to hard to do that and makes it look better anyway. Good selection for $10 in my opinion - nice way to tell a couple black controllers apart and/or force your friends to mark their controllers in a way they'll be ok with. Only downside is I would prefer half the amount of stickers at a lower price. The decals seem to all have been cut off center so the entire light bar isn't covered Do not align properly to the shape of the light bar. tried 4 different stickers and none of them did fit perfectly. Stays on great and looks good", "Excelente! After seeing so many negative reviews, I thought I would chime in.  For many years, I was a 2K guy.  Unfortunately, we all know what happened there.  So, when I decided to get a baseball game I turned to The Show. The graphics deserve an &#34;A&#34;. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall graphics. The players, even the managers actually look like the real deal.  The stadiums look legit.  What really sells it for me is the detail.  Every player has their unique stance or wind up.  Even down to their follow thru on their swing is spot on.  The players movement is extremely fluid, and it doesn't feel fake. Overall, the graphics are first rate.  As far as the gameplay, it feels good. It's smooth, and doesn't feel jerky.  The difficulty is just right.  The batting can be challenging, but not difficult.  The pitching is easy to figure out, and makes you really earn your outs.  I haven't played online yet so I can't comment there.  As far as franchise goes its good stuff.  Still has create a player which is cool, but my only gripe about the game is in the difficulty trying to find the player once you create him.  Still, its a very minor inconvenience and the player can be found. All in all, if you're  looking for a good baseball game, don't hesitate to turn to The Show. The game was a disappointment its was for my grandson birthday. It didn't work . I felt so bad. Never again will I order games from amazon .Refund please Perfect!

Great game!", "Compared to the other zelda amiibo this one is probably the best in my opinion no stand to keep great gift to give to anyone who has yet to complete they're zelda amiibo collection Well, for one, this was scheduled to arrive in mid-late September and arrived nearly a month early, so I am HUGELY impressed by that.  I am weird and, instead of buying display cases for my amiibo, I open them with EXTREME care and keep them in the box when not in use.  Probably not efficient, but whatever.  The box came entirely undamaged and the amiibo was in perfect condition.  Got it connected to my DS and will be training it over the next few weeks in between homework sessions and practice hours.  The shipping box was unlabelled and a bit sketchy, but honestly I have no complaint whatsoever.  Early makes me VERY happy.", "cheapest on the internet.

Brand new in the box.My only complaint is that the trap masters are larger than that GIANTS. But that isn't anything on the product themselves. Just one person's opinion for the team that created the Trap Team game. This was a hit with my grandson for his birthday.  He loves playing Skylanders and this was a great item to add to his collection", "No Problems Fun but not what i was expecting", "Preordered the Deluxe for the PS3. Yes, same game BUT in case you haven't noticed, IT'S BETTER AND FUN! Have you had any freezing issues? NO YOU HAVEN'T! Does Man defense work all of a sudden? YES IT DOES! Stop complaining that it's the same game. It's our fault for not buying a PS4/XB1 and getting this game. No company is making games for current gen. DEAL WITH IT!This game is amazing! I've played on this for XB1 and wow, I like it all. Draft champions is such a wonderful addition, you will love it. Coins are much easier to get and the solos are very fun this year.If you're getting this for current gen, I don't recommend if you already have M15, it's the same with upgraded Man defense and no freezing issues if you play for hours and hours. The trophies to get platinum seem the same too from M15 haha, too funny.I personally love the game for Draft Champions and MUT. It's cool but don't shell out $60 if you're not into MUT. While it doesn't have some of the new features that is presented on the current gen consoles, there are some notable changes to CMF. Players no longer drop in rating or attributes when moving them to a new position. Players such as TE have more realistic attributes as rookies. Gameplay is solid. Could've done better in terms of presentation and allowing  to edit EA Trax, but this is still a very nice game. This game is great. I am a madden faithful, and I buy the new game every year. When I went to the store today, I felt bad buying a 60 game, and the whole way home I was worried about the backlash from my wife....well, thankfully she will never know! The game is the exact same - same menu, a few different tracks, exact same gameplay, graphics, and commentary....and thankfully she dosent know enough about NFL rosters to wonder why Nick Foles is on the Rams....Thanks EA for looking out for me....pricks.... Finally arrived and was super excited to play the new franchise mode with new scouting features. Only to find out that it is only available for next gen. Played less than 1 hour and putting it up on eBay.... Like others have posted if you are on PS3 and enjoyed last years game, this is the same game just updated rosters.. I did just purchased a PS4 and will be buying Madden 16 for that system.  For me bad timing and misleading title, but I wouldn't waste your money unless you are on next gen. It's Madden '15 with updated rosters, and more bugs than a sleezy motel.Same graphics, same menus, same draft process, free agency, etc.If EA took 1/10 of the time it put into the heaping pile of dog poop they call &#34;draft champions&#34; and used it to update the game, I could at least give it 2 stars. I like the new ways the Ultimate Team is used. The only reason why it does not get 5 stars is because the gameplay is similar to Madden NFL 15. Only bought this game hoping that you could do a season without going online.How wrong I was same as last years game you can't even play defense when you are in the connected franchise modeTHAT REALLY SUCKS who wants to play offense all the time. :( The review for this game is the same for all others: same game with updated rosters.  Nothing new regarding menus, gameplay, etc.  I should've just updated my rosters in my previous Madden game.  Don't waste your money. This game sucks!! Ppl save ur money it ain't even worth spending $60 on this game Ea sports came up with a idea of ripping of peoples money. i buyed this game on first day it came out. it was complete waste of 60 dollars. They gave me the same game and content it was in last 2 madden series just the change in artwork. Dont buy this ps3 version and xbox 360 version of this game unless you have extra money to throw in dustbin. i am so upset with this game. they charge the same amount of money as xbox one and ps4 but material inside is so same like the last few madden. if you want to play this game you should have ps4 or xbox one. aweful experience with ps3 and xbox 360 version. if you have madden 15 ps3 or xbox 360 dont buy this game. If you have Madden 15 already, don't waste your money. Its the same game with updated rosters (which you can already download from the community section in the old game). Everything is the same. This game has no changes at all whatsoever for PS3.  I wasn't expecting miracle upgrades from 15 to 16, but it is exactly the same game.  Same menus, same graphics, same relocation cities/logos/team names, and basically the same game play.  I definitely regret buying this for $60. For anyone accustomed to sports games, they basically know a new year normally means an updated roster, different menus and maybe one or two new features to entice the consumer to pick it up. Madden NFL 16 for the next gen Playstation 4 and Xbox One will contain the new features that are highlighted in commercials and reviews. But for last gen, absolutely nothing is changed. It's the same game as last year, just with a nice hefty sixty dollar price tag. If you own Madden NFL 15, or heck, the last two before that. You're basically getting the same game.If the updated roster means anything then I guess I would barely recommend it. But even then I would suggest waiting for the price to drop. Not everyone can afford the Playstation 4 as of yet, but that shouldn't give EA the right to give consumers an identical copy of last years game and expect players to be happy paying full price for a inferior version. The only other positive of buying the newest Madden on PS3 is that the previous game will have less players to match up against sense its outdated, and having the newer version would most likely give you more opponents to play against.The PS3 like any other last gen console will always get inferior ports until the system retires, it's the way the business works. This review was just meant as a warning to anyone who may not be familiar with EA's lovely practice of releasing carbon copies for everyone to be disappointed in.", "I was pleased with the product. love this. it products my VITA and holds all my games. the strap did come apart where it was sewn together. i had to tie it back together, i decided not take away a start because i didn't buy it for the strap (i didn't even know there was a carrying strap for it anyway)  i bought it for its main purpose, to hold my vita and my games.The zippers are still intact but if they do fail i will be changing my start rating and will make a note on it.The case its self has a total of 20 slots for games and 2 slots for memory cards.

Great item to have beats turning on the XBOX One controller when your watching TV the XBOX Worked for about 3 days and then stopped working.

But after testing the pin-outs on the socket, it seems you have the right audio channel wired to the mono signal, which would explain the muffled sound. One my other AV cable the left and right audio channels are correctly wired to their respective pins resulting in much better sound.

Online gaming is incredibly fun and quite a good way to pass time.That aside, there are downsides to X-Box Live that can be avoided through prepaid cards. Number one, you always run the risk that unwarranted transactions will be made if your credit card information is stored on your X-Box 360 system. It may not happen all that often, but it's best to avoid it all together.The biggest reason to buy prepaid Xbox Live card is the renewal process that happens when you don't use one. If you order X-Box Live through your system, it'll renew every time your subscription runs out. This wouldn't be a problem except that it's not that easy to cancel. Instead of canceling through your system, you have to go through the hassle of actually calling X-Box Live support. Even then, depending on the representative you get, you may be hassled to keep your subscription because they really don't want you to cancel it. I'...

I knew this however when purchasing the item from other reviewers so I bumped my review up from a 3 to a 4. My real reason for purchasing this item over others was that I already had the same model charging station for my PS4 (and love it!). As for the xbox one model, the only thing holding your controller on the base is gravity. And as we all know, sometimes gravity can be a finicky beast. Also the batteries supplied do not contain as much of a charge as the official rechargeable batteries from Microsoft.All in all however, the device serves its purpose fine so long as you recognize it's faults. I have placed mine in an area that the controllers are not likely to get knocked off the charger but yet it's close enough for me to grab a spare controller if I need one. The indicator lights on the charge station are also nice. I assumed this would get the job done based on others reviews, but I actually am loving this thing thus far!It is quite cheap for giving 2 batteries and a charger stand so it wasn't a big risk to try it out. I personally love the click up to store and click down to charge, I'm the type of person who can't leave a phone plugged in at 100% or even leave the charger in the wall be itself. I don't think I'm OCD... It just erks me... The LEDs look pretty cool too so no hate on them. They aren't as bright as I thought they might be which is good.Don't get me wrong, it does seem a bit cheap. I don't know how long the click will stay strong or the batteries will last. At least as being new I know the batteries last longer than a 6 hour gaming session. That's about my max on a weekend and I have had no issues with the batteries needing charged mid play. Only time will tell as to there life span, but everything dies eventually. For &#60;$25 I'm ok with that. (I got a charge cable just in case it was ever necessary for &#60;$8. Doubt I'll ever need it...)Lastly I would like to inquire about this struggle to place the controller on charge...? The stand has a little nub that fits perfectly into the Mic usb port on the controller... you just sit your controller on that nub and lean it back, then, click down to charge... I've have to have tried this 100 times already just to see what these reviewer were talking about... I just don't see it... It works flawlessly every time!", "My kids love this game!

Was a Christmas present and they loved it.", "Unable to find these in a normal store so was excited I could find it on Amazon.  My 21 year old daughter requested this for christmas and I was happy to be able to find it.  Works as expected, great price. Warning do not buy this. It doesn't read disk.", "The glossy finish feels horrible even with just minor sweat. It also doesn't have real triggers but buttons in there place. the price is ridiculous and Nintendo rips you off for having to get this controller for certain games - but I bought it anyway!! Works just fine according to the kids - they think it's a bargain - what do they know!!", "Great game!  Amazing graphics.  Good campaign mode. One of the best cod games i really enjoy playing it ok Excellent product and seller! Call of Duty seems to be forgetting its roots. Not into the Sci-Fi aspect of the latest trappings.  Have shifted to Battlefield franchise for real military first person shooter.  Call of Duty has sped into the future and has left part of its fan base behind. Previously traded in my launch copy but decided to re-purchase so that I could play through the campaign. I must say that the multiplayer is the worst of any of the Call of Duty games but the campaign is top notch. Worth a play through. Arrived in good condition, worked fine... But not a great game. Wish the multiplayer could have been more expansive and wasnt forced to purchase DLC. Overall pretty good game!Single player is great! Awesome story with Kevin Spacey!", "Great game. Game play is challenging yet fun, and the story line was interesting from beginning to end. Great I found that this game was complicated to figure out,  I understand there are 19 buttons on a controller and am new to Playstations, so I am unable to memorize different functions per button to keep from getting confused what a button does with out referring to the book guide.", "Delivered on time. Everything arrived great as expected. Very happy with purchase. Built in Wi Fi included in this version of xbox 360. delivered as promised works as advertised, cheapest build quality for the xbox 360.", "Graphics are not on par with next gen. Could have spent more time on development. The evil within is a much better game. Admittedly I ordered a copy towards the end of July almost a year after the game was originally released when I should have just gotten it when it came out. This game is a must have for any fan of the alien movies and of survival horror.  The bad about this game is that their are a few glitches and character animation issues. Although the animation issues were mainly after the update to the game also some bad voice acting from minor characters. Amanda Ripley is a believe able character and a protagonist who I was rioting for the whole way. The alien is down right terrifying as it is a constant threat and its behavior is totally random, and the detail put into it is amazing. The world is visually identical to the first alien movie which is great and the graphics are awesome and space walks are pretty memorable. The weapons are awesome and the crafting can get you out of some tricky situations involving the Xeno, the creepy androids, and survivors on Sevastopol. Ammo is scarce as it should be so its best to conserve. Fire is your only true defense against the xenomorph and moltovs and the flamethrower is super effective but ammo goes super fast. You will also be tempted to let the Xeno kill you because the death animations are really cool. The androids are really creepy since they are cheap rubber skinned knock offs of Weyland Yutani's that spout safety protocol as they try to kill you. The bolt gun is the best way to kill them but once again ammo is scarce. The sound effects and score are also great and their are lots of hacking mini games and well done audio logs from the Sevastopol and even ones recorded by the original cast of Alien. Also trophy's/ achievements can all be earned offline and are fun to earn. Another effective trick that adds to the urgency of the game is that saves are all manual so save regularly to avoid losing progress Works great.", "Cool cool Nice as expected", "great game very good", "My kids lost interest in this game very quickly. It seems the set always requires more and more pieces, otherwise they're very limited in what they can do. I think it's because of that that they have lost interest. It seems it has been more a money pit than anything else. Thank you excellent", "It's minecraft!!!! My kids are hooked on it. It's not violent and really puts their creative juices to the test. This game is good for kid. My daughter love it. she design their own city. Cute little game. I didn't like it at first because of the weird square setting, everything is a square. But really like it when start playing with my friend. Cool couple game. I like being the one being protected and waiting for the sunrise haha Excellent It's Minecraft. On Xbox One. Can't complain at all. It's just a good game overall My 12 yr old AND 6 yr old sons love this game! Not all purchases carry over. All maps are transferable. Though that is a pain to do. Despite that it's everything you know and love of Minecraft.", "it gives great grip on an otherwise slippery controller. it is a little ruff to get it in just the right spot the first time but its manageable. i think the price is alittle high but its  a nice product. Wasent carfull and messed mine up I'd recommend watching a video on putting email on I got a set for the 360, and was relatively pleased. The grip is solid, and feels fantastic. It fits the controller well, and doesn't get in the way. However, the adhesive keeping the grip stuck to the controller could be a bit stronger; there are definitely a couple problem spots on mine which keep coming unstuck.", "yeah I bought mine refurbished what thateabs is that it arrives on your doorstep broken i guess so I chose to get s new ps4 instead and had no problems since may the Dodd be with hug Brought it a month ago and works brand new", "Great controller, i just wish microsoft would give us this controller with the xbox! The Play & Charge kit is not good.  The wire connector loses electrical contact and doesn't effectively charge the controller if you move even slightly - like when you are playing the game....We went through 2 of them, and they both performed poorly.  I've gone with a different recharging solution.Big fan of Xbox One overall, and the microsoft controllers are good.  But don't waste your money on  this as your charging solution.", "Please don't waste your time!

It was like they were brand new. My son absolutely loves these and the sound quality is AMAZING I have been buying gaming head phones for 20 years. This is the best set I have ever purchased.  I would buy another pair today if I needed some.", "I got it. Not a bad price and I recieved the correct version. Sucks that scalper a are always one step ahead. Only gets 4 stars for being 1 day late. Highly recommended based on quality. THANKS Perfect just as described.  Fast Shipping. Amazing. Thank you l'm really feeling like it's Shulk time. Now i can unleash the power of the Monado, And get stuck in to training him for battles. gift for my daughter to add to her collection", "Terrible. I am very disappointed. I get the charger but of course there is no cable included . Thank you Sony! !I would rather spend a little more and have everything that I need in one box. Sony people how would you like to buy a new television and open the box and find out that you have to buy the power cord because it's not included! ! Best way to charge up the Vita a couple of times and it is an official Sony product. did not last one week doze not change works great", "I was really disappointed in this product. I didn't receive any directions and after I applied the skin I removed the protective covering (it looked like it was supposed to be removed but I might be wrong as I didn't receive any instructions) then no more than 1 minute later the design started to smudge and come off on my hands. I wouldn't suggest buying this. Product arrived on time and seller also included two free screen covers.  The cover was easy to install and has stayed on. We installed it over a month ago and don't have any corners lifting. We did follow the instructions and cleaned the 3DS XL with the supplied cleaning cloths.We would recommend and buy from Ci-Yu-Online again.", "Had to play it before the new ones came out. Gonna be honest, the sequel is better, but you might want to play the games in chronological order, because the second starts after the end of this game. That aside, one of the best games I've ever played.", "Thank you MY SON LOVES PLAYING THIS GAME. its tough to play Who doesn't like Animal Crossing? Definitely one of my favorite games. my grandson loves this game", "Compliments any and all TurtleBeach headsets. Headset slips off.", "It easy to install and very fast loading into game.Because I use internal hard disk. I purchased the Nyko Databank for PS4 awhile back so I could increase the amount of storage space on it for the hard drive I chose to use a Seagate 4TB SSHD SATA 6Gb/s Cache 3.5-inch drive make sure to use a computer to reformat the drive to Ex fat using a computer not your PS4 or you'll crash the system. On the box it says to use a hard drive with 2TB or less because the firmware won't support anything bigger than 2TB it will support up to a 4TB SSD the only thing is you can't use rest mode at least until they update the firmware. Before you turn on your PS4 to use the new drive you need to get a flash drive with 1GB of storage or greater go online to www.playstaion.com and download the latest software update and then put your PS4 into safe mode to do that hold down the power button on the system until you hear two beeps once in safe mode put the flash drive into one of the slots on the console then on the menu that comes up select the last option this will erase everything that you have done its worth it in the end re initialize the system set it all up again the way you had it While I do like it I don't like that my disk games are not working correctly, although the 4tb I have to store digital games is pretty nice. For people looking to get more than 2tb, grab the Toshiba 7200RPM 4tb drive (just search for it here), seems to work more consistantly than the drive in the recommendations. was simple and works as expected, words of advice though you wont be able to skin it because of the different levels but it is the only down side Bought for my husband and this wouldn't work with system. According to Sony, this is not supported and won't work with the PlayStation software. A little bit complicated to install but will be happy after installing. Great idea but the PS4 cant support that much storage. I did my homework on it and the best i can figure is that your PS4 has a 50/50 chance of it working. Even if it does work it cannot be in rest mode or it will not be able to play games once you wake it up. 0/10 Sure I've had a few issues but noting the internet can't fix, if your fine with your console now, don't upgrades until laters. But, if you want a 'Ton of Games' at your finger tips with not enough room to hold them all on your current hard drive; get the DB and 4tb or higher. I got the 4tb on sale get deal.I just Beat Bloodborne, and I really wished I bought it on my HD because I hate switching disc. What had happen two weeks ago was I went to Play a game from a disc and it was the first time I played one from my DB. Keep giving me this Stupid Error Code about your disc drive doesn't work. So the safest bet on the PS4 is to Boot the system up in Safemode, then Reinitialize; 90% of the time its the right call, and its almost 50% of the time when you call PS4 support they'll ask you do this if the problem is that difficult regardless of the problem.It fix the problem, to my only other problem is I can't use Sleepmode. In standby for too long the console shuts off and and acts like there was a power outage; just play it safe and save a few bucks. Shut the console off completely and always take off that Auto Turn-off feature, I was at a point in FFXIV where I had to do a few things that took longer than I hoped and it shut off, nothing was wrong but the whole you disconnected the power  or whatever BS showed up and. It just scares me when I get that message. That reminds me of my days with Poke'mon where your save file was gone and you had to start over. I love'd my 47 out of 152  at level 99 game. FYI, (SMH) my goal was to get all 152 Poke'mon to 99.P.S. Still a great buy", "Bought as gift for grandson's birthday - he LOVES it! No complaints. Controller came quick and works great. The controller I purchased is a carbon copy of the one in the pic. Sony never fails to amaze me. I love the colour and would recommend anybody to purchase one. Thanks again Sony. good controllers, fast UPS shipping Excellent paint job, reliable and arrives in less time than expected THIS CONTROLLER WORKS GREAT. Works great and looks nice. Like brand new! No cable charger came with it thats ok! Good price and fast shipping. keeps disconnecting, gettin annoyed while playing.... In time and exactly how it was described The controller worked perfectly! excelent", "Funny video game, but difficult levels lol Best puzzle game for the money.  Intricatestory and fun premise. awesome. I've always wanted this game very good Game was good but short and can be boring after awhile I beat 2 times already different endings", "The game is overall good, story's a might lacking as I imagine you'd expect, but there's enough there to drive the core of the game forward and get you to your next action packed, barely clothed, slaughter-fest. The art in general is very nice and the artbook  has some great images in it. The soundtrack is good, nowhere near one of my favourites, but definitely good.If I had one gripe with the game it's that the boss fights that Iv'e faced at the point of writing this are tedious, without anything to keep the player interested in the fight while they slog through the large amount of health and possible multiple forms the bosses have.For anyone without an American PS4, be aware that the DLC may not work for you, it didn't work on my Irish console so just keep that in mind.As far as packaging and delivery go, the game arrived earlier than was expected, fully packaged and with everything listed on the page, more than satisfactory. Fun gameplay and improved graphics isn't enough to compensate for missing or downgraded features from previous titles, most notable in my opinion being a lack of co-op (worse now that there are four characters playable almost immediately) and a scarcer costume system. Love this game, have beat it on all difficulties and have finished most of the missions, there's tons of action and lots of stuff to unlock, highly recommend for anybody looking for a hack and slash that's on the cheesy side. Kinky, but great game.", "It is really good for a starting FG novice. Broke within weeks", "I don't like that you can't use them on the first system but my son is happy that they came out with the super hero's on the 2.0 system.  We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.  Great buy for any family fun or game night. Disney missed so much with Infinity 2.0 and it pales in comparison to Skylanders for the Story Mode. Hopefully Infinity 3.0 is a much better offering.", "The left analog stick keeps breaking. The New controller is nice. The left and right bumper button click much easier then before, and the new 3.5 mm jack works good to.Pros: improved bumpers, 3.5 mm jack,cons: It kind of sucks when using your own headphones having to navigate through a bunch of settings menus in order to adjust the game, chat, and mic volumes. but meh, you get used to it. I just got this controller. It's flawless... It's great! I ordered this item and received the basic controller, not the 3.5mm jack one. Buyer beware. Works as expected This has the headphone jack built in, so while the wife does something else, I can play my games without interrupting her....happy wife, happy life... Excellent I just received this july 9 today is august 26 left triger sticks right stick locks in diferent directions it is not worth 5 dollars avoid at all cost Tried with Turtle Beach X41 and Black Ops 2 X-Ray headsets.  Was unable to adjust volume balance to hear party chat well.  Volume maxed out for chat (chat +/- buttons) on headset but even with volume knob for game sound turned all the way down there was still game sound that drowned out party chat.  The headset adapter allows for much better level control but causes intermittent controller disconnects.  Microsoft really screwed the pooch with their headset integration with Xbox One.  It was a great idea to integrate the headphone/chat feature into these new controllers but with the lack of level controls I was unable to get the chat volume high enough to hear my teammates screaming at me to stop fiddling with my controller/headset.  Returning.", "exelen very good", "Dollar Tree has better stuff than this. I didn't even have it for a hour before it it broke, luckily i was able to &#34;kinda&#34; fix it. Don't wast your time or your money. I just received it & its broken.... Help The battery pack doesn't actually fit the controller.  Completely useless and a waste of money! Broke the first day we used it. Extremely disappointed. They kept a charge for a very short amount of time, and after 3 or 4 recharges, they quit taking a charge completely. We had ordered 2 sets, and they both quit. Waste of money. Battery and the stand it lights up really well", "I bought the red one from USPRO and it works fine except that the battery does not seem to last nearly as long as my official $50 sony controllers.  Not a bid deal, you can still play for many hours (I'd say at least 6 on a full charge, maybe longer, I never counted).  Other than that, it looks, feels and functions just like the real thing and is identical in every way except it says &#34;P3&#34; on the center button instead of the official PS3 logo.  The joysticks have a nice rubber grip too like the real controller.  My 3 year old loves it and will only play with this controller now.  He has used it daily for about a week playing various LEGO games with no issues at all.  I don't know if the rumble/vibrate function works or not, as I have only used the controller myself very briefly, but for this price who cares.Another thing to note is that the controller will turn off automatically if you don't use it after a certain (and fairly short) period of time.  For example, if you are watching a movie on Netflix or something where you wouldn't be pushing buttons on the controller it will turn off, which is kind of annoying because you need to push the ps3 button to turn it back on before you can pause the movie, but overall this is a probably a good feature because it saves battery life and you can just fall asleep or walk away and it will turn off on its own.Overall, I highly recommend this if you need an extra controller.  It is not worth paying over 3 times the price for an official Sony controller when the only real difference seems to be a longer battery life.  I was skeptical about buying a generic controller, but this one from USPRO works great so far and I'm very pleased. Bought 2 and charged for over 24 hours and they still will not work. Piece of cheap junk. I guess you get what you pay for. i love it Awesome !!!! Works like the original !!!", "My Son is really enjoying this game he can't put it down. Thank you so much.  For having it in stock. And for your fast service. Thank you Mrs Phyllis Boris  I Love Amazon Great game. Worth every penny Very great game. If your looking for a game to keep your husband off your back, look no further. Very good quite possibly the best game I've ever played. They sure know how to turn the second half of the game into a subpar version of Twisted Metal Excellent I really like the fighting controls and the batmoble but it overused is this game I hate the the lack of hand to hand boss fights and the end of the story.SPOlERSAfter you find out arkham Knight is red hood you don't even fight you just grapple to a few gargoyles and your done and when deathsroke show he's in a tank at the end of story batman this is the last time became everyone know who he is.he have hush he can  set up like hush pretened to be batman to destroy Bruce wyanes life so every batman villain will be trying to attack bruce he can us that voice gadget to set it up.

LOVE IT!", "As a family we enjoy spending time together, this was a great choice every family member has play with it We bought this for our energetic 10 year old, do to the song choices available. The product was new, the price was affordable after looking at this at local stores. The shipping was quick. She loves to dance to the Wii game.", "his favorite - he loves this game, always playing it. I think it's too redundant. Always doing the same thing over and over. Super Awesome! Love the game, always played with friends but never actually had the game. Now I have it, awesome! Assassins Creed set in the 1600s pirate era in the Caribbean.  I loved ship to ship combat.  I loved the graphics.  I am into history.  The only thing I did not like was being jarred out of the historical immersion to go to the sci-fi Abstergo offices to collect post-it notes.  I work in a high-tech office--I am playing this game to escape from that! Awsome game son happy Best Assassin's Creed game yet - the tried to copy it's success with Rogue but failed. Great game for pirate enthusiasts, but lacks some of the stealth charm most of the other entries provide well. Still a great game in its own respect, and adds a nice spin on the series", "good I've had this controller for almost a year now and wanted to post my review.Plus :Nice LookWorks just like the standard controllerMinus :-Cheaply made.  It hasn't broken, but on the verge of breaking.-Seems a bit bigger than the standard one.  I go back to the standard controller and it feels a tad bit smaller than this one. Absolutely love this controller, defiantly worth the money!! Looks great and feels fantastic", "Not as enjoyable as I was hoping.  The loading times and instant death QTE's turned me off to this quite quickly.  Which is a shame considering how much I've loved Shinji Mikami's previous work.  If you absolutely love Resident Evil 4 style gameplay, this game will feel pretty good. Excellent!!! Exelent Decent game If you are bored of your standard fps and want to try something challenging and new, try this out. It's not perfect, especially on the story side of things, but the intense and rewarding gameplay has me coming back for second play through. This is gore version of resident evil/Silent hillif you love survival horror and somewhat enjoyed the movies &#34;Saw&#34; this is the perfect game for youAtte: I removed 1 star because the way of playing the games in &#34;Chapters&#34; is not that good idea to meNote: The case arrived ripped, I do not know if its amazon or the shipping company's fault, however the game made it ok. Descent Best game I have purchased this year. Better than The Last of Us - that was such a soap opera! This game is for Resident Evil 4 (and before) lovers. It's perfect. Single player survival horror - hope they make The Evil With 2.", "No Japanese voice track made me sad. Otherwise good. Great game so far. Ragequit for a while after raising relationships and sharing teenage angst banter several times with a character only for them to betray me. Gameplay is pretty similar to Valkyrie Chronicles in my opinion, short of the fact that I no longer have to aim. Only gripe is that I wish the &#34;spot the traitor&#34; voice thing was a little more defined.", "Excellent Classic!", "I'm an optimist so I ignored the many poor reviews on this product.  I should not have been an optimist.  Complete junk.  Product is curved, where the 2DS is flat.  Impossible to secure to the device.  Look elsewhere for a case. I didn't like this at all. It hardly snaps on to the 2ds and even the smallest fall, it just pops right off. It's useless.", "Bought it for my 4 year old niece who loves Disney princesses. She loves it, not frustrating for her to play. You can have 2 players and change their appearances, outfit and accessories. Just approach mirror one the second floor left stairs. This game requires nunchucks! Can't start without it. Game consists of twirling the wiimote as a wand in different directions and moving character with nunchucks toggle. You get to play in each princess world with own difficulty. With two players you take turns doing challenges/mini game. Doesn't seem long to beat Ariel's world. I bought this for my four year old and she absolutely loves it!! Some things are a little difficult for her to figure out but it's a perfect game for younger kids to wander around and be a princess. She loves designing her own dress and features every time. We don't play a lot of video games so maybe that's why she struggles a little but it isn't a big deal. The game is a perfect intro game for younger princess loving girls :) cool game for my 5 year old. My daughter LOVES this game. Even used it came in excellent condition. Thanks so much!", "So I love the game features. But I don't recommend the game at all. The new town that is added with all the new game features doesn't work. It's constantly freezing. And no. Its not you. It's not your computer. Don't uninstall any other expansion packs. It's just the town. This expansion pack is one of the best I've ever gotten. Running a resort is really fun, plus the extras like fishing for sharks, going boating and windsurfing, are great.", "Have received idk where it is. Not happy. Great. My kids begged for this after playing the demo, and it's now one of their favorites. love I'm enjoying the game overall, but my copy seems to be glitchy. I've played through to the second to last level, and then it froze on a cut scene, so I'm not able to progress.I also experienced the &#34;cat #4 unbreakable bench&#34; glitch in Bricksburg, which is annoying, but something you can play around.Overall, still as fun as most of the other games in the series, but possibly not as great for gameplay issues. Good. It's fun if you like the movie, but a little repetitive at times...  don't pay full price, I think I got it for $10 and it's worth that, kids were into it for a few months", "Good entertainment EXCELLENT Great game", "I do love this game. In fact, I'm actually playing it again a second time around. The reason I knocked off a star is because the end of game was oh so rushed. I like doing all the side quests (defeating the Borgia, finding all the Romulus keys, thief assignments, etc.) and, I forgot what sequence, but towards the end you don't get a choice to decline the quest it just keeps going until you've completed the game. NOw of course there may have actually been a way to go back and finish the side quests, but I obviously have no clue or not to that effect. son happy", "Great game! I love this game! If you like PvZ and Call of Duty,  you'll love this game!  I wish I could give it 1 million stars!", "Worked, lol Excelente Very well made and engaging fighter.

Unless they only make this in one region or country, I would not pay that much for a 500gb ps4. What the hack is this price coming from? Greedy Greedy Greedy WAAAAAAAAAAAY too expensive. If the price was converted to U.S money it would come out to $373 and change. If someone was to sell it for around that price I would buy it.", "This was a gift for my brother.. he was very happy with it thank you. game was in good shape Great addition to the Resident Evil series.

Great graphics, fun to play and really like the addition of Dixie and Cranky.  My 7 year old son loves to play it along with the adults.  Would recommend!", "Great headset and mic, but with the PS4 and this is a MAJOR factor that I never knew about, the Amplifier(Bass & Treble) does NOT work on PS4. I spent a lot of time looking for a good mic'd set and this is it, was pissed about the AMP(Bass & Treble) but other than that it's comfortable, has a long lead which is always good. The overall volume could be higher but again I'm putting this down to the Amplifier issue. Overall, happy with it, never experienced the Amp working so really I don't know what I'm missing. If anyone has suggestions regarding the amp, please let me know. I must try it on PC someday to see how the amp works properly. Amazing gaming headphone, I have had mine for over a year now and don't always treat with care but everything on it still works fine. Works with my Iphone 5s, PS4, TV, basically anything with a headphone jack. I would say tge only thing that keeps this just short of greatness is the fact that they could be just a little bit bigger to fit comfortably. That isn't to say it isn't comfortable, it just takes some adjustment of the headphones to be comfy. This is a great mike. Just a little fragile . Has broken in the same place three times. My son loves using it so we replace them.", "AAA+++ Brilliant", "not as user friendly as we would like Ordered this for myself for gaming and have been using it for a couple weeks at this point.  The main reason I chose this headset is because in video reviews the microphone sounded amazing and hands down better almost every other $50-100 headset I looked at.  The headset does not disappoint, mic quality is excellent and I have no complaints about the audio, no static or hissing as far as I can tell.  The control box has a lot of great functions and works as advertised. No major complaints about the comfort, ears are completely covered although occasionally I get a little pressure on my jaw.ONE WORD OF WARNING THOUGHI had trouble getting the device to work properly initially, seemed as though it would start to sync drivers up, fail and not work.  I looked into it and apparently the headset couldn't get enough power from the usb despite a brand new computer with a solid motherboard. I don't know if it's a common issue but the solution is to use a powered usb hub which I had (usb hub that has an a/c cord).  Once I did that it performed amazingly.Even with my usb issue I still recommend this headset,", "Exactly what I needed works great Excellent", "10/10 would play again You have my business for sure!

However, I bit the bullet, and have had no regrets. The game mechanics are very similar to Arkham City, with some minor gadget variations. Overall, the game plays great, though it does have some minor hiccups, such as a slight pause during the cutscenes, or small glitches involving the hostiles when you interrogate them. If you are on the fence about purchasing this, I would recommend you do. As of right now, I feel it has the best boss battles among the 4 Arkham games, in addition to the best story line.", "MY SON LOVES IT quality seems pretty good, I like it I dont love it , doesnt seem to be worth the higher cost", "It's awesome grate this is a great product for anyone who knows how to use it. Sadly the one i received is finicky and often disconnects itself in the middle of rewriting the profile. It worked and got here on time. The only problem was that it doesnt work on the snow leopard 10.6 mac like it says. Luckily I have a laptop and can use it still. It works. It works great. Awesome product that's perfect for DS games!", "kids loved it. Great Game For the price, I like it. Fun with Good for exercise. I like it better than having to pay $2 per song with Dance Central Xbox One. Can have many players too. Will get 2014 soon. Many good songs. Have additional free songs. And, of course, videos of yourself looking ever so silly. Excellent Our boys love it", "Its serves its purpose well, not great for shooter games but works wonderfully well with anything else. I been playing games like skyrim, nba 2k, and assasins creed without any issues. Would give 5 stars if it wasnt for dead zones in fps games but great. 1994", "Thanks... Only able to use it as a USB headset but it works great. Only issue is airflow to my ears isn't great so they get hot after wearing them. I bought these as a gift for my husband but we ended up returning them because they don't plug in to the controller.  We would've had to plug them into the PS4 which would mean a long cord across our living room.  He did test them out before we returned them though and said that they fit comfortably and the sound quality was great.", "Works just as good as the original. No issues and price isn't bad. Glad i bought it this is not the charger as stated. it is the power cord. choose words wisely seller. charger vs power adaptor or power cord is a HUGE DIFFERENCE!", "Not the Correct ower cord. Doesn't even fit. Not for snes DO NOT BUY! PLEASE READ THE REVIEWS!I made a terrible mistake buying this cause it doesnt even work for my snes. The cord doesn't fit the snes. Whatever those 5 stars are telling you are lies. Now i have to order another one from somewhere else, i wasted 7$ for no reason. Again dont buy", "Great product, as described. Great seller! Purchased this for my kids and it's one of their favorite characters. Arrived fast and as advertised.", "Action packed game kids love. excelente Husband loves this game. Call of duty gets more attention than I do! LOL But really, it's a cool game I HATE THIS game with a passion. It has horrible graphics and is very, very unrealistic. I play COD for the realness and good graphics. This game has neither. I was very surprised too and a bit upset since I spent so much on it and waited a week for it in the mail.", "Received the first one and it would not work at all. The second one would start but would lock up before you could play it. Both had disk read errors. Arrived quick and works great. I see many fun times ahead with this game.", "Cheap.  The headphones are really small and don't go around your ears. They hurt if you wear them for more than 15 minutes. Bought this 1 month ago and use it daily. Crystal clear sound in full stereo, mic is working well and sound is clear according to people I speak with in PS4 games. I really enjoy mute button and volume control. They work really well and are very easy to set up and use. My only complaint is that the ear covers are too small so they can get uncomfortable after awhile. Even with that, it's hard to find a product like this for the price. Excellent quality and we will continue to buy this brand for its performance and lower price. I purchased these headphones so that I could play PS4 while my wife slept at night.  I work until late at night and my wife is usually sleeping by the time I get home.  This headset fits the bill perfectly.  It's a little small and the ear cups could be a little bigger (hence the 4 star rating), but what I love is that the headset plugs directly into the PS4 controller and not directly into the PS4 (unlike the Turtle Beach counterparts).  This basically makes it a semi-wireless headset.I haven't had any issues with other people hearing my voice and the microphone has seemed to have help up over the past couple months of use.  Another drawback would be the microphone doesn't disconnect so it's just kinda there as you play.  Overall, the sound is great, and for the price, I couldn't have asked for more.Pros- Great Sound- Semi-Wireless- Cheap PriceCons- Fit is a little tight- Ear cups could be bigger- Microphone doesn't detatch Had trouble connecting to the mic after using it for 2 days. Not impressed.", "I was not disappointed at all with this game.  Perfect introduction to the next chapter of the series. Excellent game! It very short bad very bad This is an awesome game with fantastic graphics only real problem is its very very short.  This was for the Metal Gear fans like myself!", "So I just got my controller in the mail and it looks great and seem to work just fine except it's black. Now that wouldn't be a problem if I hadn't specifically chosen the blue one. And the black one costs less so I paid more than necessary for the product I recieved. Also when I revved it, it was just a controller and recieved wrapping in bubble wrap. Call me picky but I prefer my new items to be unopened and in their original box. Plus the sticker on the bubble wrap it even says it's &#34;seablue&#34; who ever wrapped this and sent it to me knew what they were doing, they just didn't care. I would send it back but I need a controller to play my games and I'm already irritated to the point of just giving up. Really nice controller only the place for the battery is kinda hard to find", "The screw drivers worked great These tools work great but I found the someone's without the prying tool which you don't really need at Walmart for a lot less. But these have a rotating handle which makes them easy to use", "Really Nice More than I thought i was going to get. Love it. It pretty much covers everything. You do need to take youre time putting it on, but its worth it.", "Great game awesome, just awesome. i'm a fan of RPGs, and I loved the concept of this game. so creative and fun.", "Best one so far. Great solid game. Really that funny! Good.", "This is one of THE most frustrating gaming experiences I have ever had. Graphics are great, Game play is spot on.This COULD have been another Halo type of game (albeit with RPG and MMO elements). I took 3 stars away because of the sh*tty servers at Bungie and getting kicked off Xbox Live all the time. Bungie is SUPPOSEDLY 'working VERY hard' (as per Bungie.net), but this game has been out for literally MONTHS now (new DLC has even come out), and not a thing has been fixed. I keep getting close to completing a mission and BANG! I get black screened or kicked off Live, or else it's a 'caterpiller' error. And does it save your checkpoint? HELL NO. Gotta start the level all over again. SO FRUSTRATING!!! Is this Bungie's idea of a joke? This game was RUSHED onto the market. Bugs galore. Thank GOD I waited and bought it used for $20. BUYER BEWARE! For $19 this was a great price for this game. Awesome MMO game. Fast prime shipping. Just what I expected! Great Item & Even Better Shipping Great This game just did not live up to the hype for me.  Completely generic combat.  Too much repetitiveness in the missions.  The darkness portion of the missions are especially a pain.  Get killed and you have to go back to the beginning and all the enemies you've already killed will respawn.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the ammo you've used.  Aggravating.  The MMORP aspect of the game seems kind of light.  If you're playing single player its even lighter.  If you don't have an internet connection and at least an xbox live silver acct, do not buy this game because you're not going to be playing it.  At all.  If your xbox 360 doesn't have more than a 4gb hard drive - do not buy this game because you cant even install it.  I'm glad I waited until the priced dropped, if I'd have paid full price for this game I'd have felt violated.  There's just too many other - better shooters out there that tell a more compelling and coherent story.  Destiny seems to have collapsed under the weight of it's own ego. My son loves this game", "I purchased this when I was working in a machine shop and I needed something that would protect the bulk of my DS from grime and debris. As a result, my review is coming from a somewhat biased place, since any case was going to have to work really hard to do its job.The case itself fits nicely, though I had to take a few minutes to figure out how to snap it on. If you have your DS open too much or too little, you can't get this on or off. It's a decent clear, so the colour isn't overly compromised, which I do like. It's sturdy enough that I don't feel like it'll have a problem protecting my system, although it's not padded so a decent impact would still break the machine.However, I find it doesn't do a fantastic job of keeping the dust and grime out, by any means. Scratches, yes. Spills, yes. I still find myself having to take off the case to clean it once in a while because my DS starts to get a lot of little particles hanging out under the plastic protector. It's also much more difficult to get the case *off* than it was to get it on. I'm very clumsy and have a tendency of dropping electronics. To avoid breaking my 3DS, I bought this and it has been working perfectly for about 10 months now! It fits perfectly on my 3DS, and it can withstand a big beating! (I drop it on hardwood floors) I highly recommend this product if you need protection for your 3DS!", "Excellent works great", "I was excited to receive this headset. Was.. I'm only giving this 2 stars because of the head sets beauty. I love the way it looks. Sound quality...ehhh. Too muddy. Lots of mid range frequencies. At 50 bucks I wasn't expecting amazing quality. The thing that made me throw them right back in the box was the left speaker going out after the 1st use! Waste of my time. Very nice headset feels very good on the head i can wear the headset it fit great over the ears and head sounds great better then most headsets iv tried.And iv tried 100red of different kinds of headset and TRITTON headsets has been the best iv found on the market for the PS4 And Music.", "Was a gift! OK, so this game may not be a AAA title and is glitchy at times, but it is damn fun. I really enjoyed the 32 hours or so it provided. Good classic RPG stuff right here. At the asking price for this title, its a no brainer.", "Great audio quality. Works extremely well, microphone is very clear. Its no better than other brands, and you can't beat the price. They work great. Using as PS4 headset earbuds. Be warned that only one earbud works when just chat audio goes to headphones. Both will work if you send chat and game audio to headset. Okay sound, but God they are uncomfortable for anyone but someone with big ears. I don't have particularly small ears, but I am female. The design of the outside has sharp angles and they press on tge tender cup of your ears. After a while they really start to hurt a lot.Bad design. Or at least design great for guys only. For $10, these things have lasted longer than literally 9 other headphones I've owned in the same time.  Mute slider is a must for ps4 chatting, I've even had to use it to run outside in a pinch. I purchased these to use with my PS4 controller because my bose in-ear did not work correctly (the mic).  This have been great.  I just plug them in and adjust the levels and it worked wonderfully.  If you are looking for a cheap in-ear that has great quality, these should be your choice. Great sound and the reason for four instead of five stars is that the mic switch is labeled (or wired) incorrectly. On is off and off is on.", "Awesome fun game very unique. Definitely worth the purchase! Excellent game", "The game is amazing, but the copy I received was defective. I ended up getting it from Walmart. excellent", "Rare accessory not found in stores anymore, collect now while supplies last. Otherwise this is a very good case for vita 1000 or 2000. Good quality, nice padding inside Quite large and smells great. Can fit 5 games and they never fall out. Nice soft material.", "Great works great, have used it a lot and never any issues. Great for gaming. would recommend. Great mouse, I am a graphic designer in training and this mouse fits my needs very well. I also love the blue lights. The scroll is nice and smooth and the mouse itself is a bit longer, perfect for people with bigger hands. Overall I love it. Wish you could change the speed Plugged it in, and it works like a charm.  No issues. Bought this May 2013 on a recommendation for a cheap gaming mouse with good performance. It is used a few hours everyday for gaming. Over 2 years later, it is still going strong and is my husband's preferred gaming mouse. It has been two years since I purchased this product, and it still works well. If you're in need of a functioning mouse, and don't care about extra buttons, fancy configurations, etc. Look no further. Excellent i didnt use it too much.. ended up giving it to my bro he games... and he loves it! Very cheaply made, uncomfortable to hold in hand, I lost it and don't really care.", "Good quality only issue is the smell of the ear cups, but excellent sound. Very poor quality. Wasnt expecting this quality Just tried the headset and they work perfect sound quality and mic work great. Also tried them on my phone and it all works with my music and videos and to make calls. I highly recommend this headset bought these on prime day and worked great for awhile then the plastic band already broke.. I stream and need something reliable and this was not it.. P.S. i baby my equipment and they were not abused they are simply put cheaply made Very easy to break, plastic parts that connect the earphones and connecting bar are not durable.", "One of the best Mario Games  for handheld 3DS! My Daughter LOVES it. A must have game for anyone with a 3DS. Honestly you can never go wrong with mario. My save file has 5 sparkling stars, so I can't claim this isn't a fun game considering all the time I've sunk into it....However, it has major flaws.1. First, the forced &#34;2.5-D&#34; perspective or whatever the technical term is. I HATE the camera in this game. This game is very easy. The challenge exists solely in how much you're not allowed to see from moment to moment. The camera swings around to different distances and angles constantly and arbitrarily, preconfigured on a track made by the game designers. Most often, it only moves when Mario moves, so if you're in an area and there's a enemy just offscreen, the camera won't back up to allow you to see the enemy until you walk to where the enemy IS! Did it kill or hurt you from offscreen in your moronic quest to get permission from the camera to see it? Screw you, love - the game makers. There's a boss battle at the end of the game with a boss trolling the far wall and a boss trolling the near wall. If you inch forward at all, the camera zooms past the near enemy to focus on the far wall. You have to hit one boss then the other until both are dead. Not really hard at all. Except the camera will not allow you to see the near wall enemy unless you move Mario all the way from the far wall to the near wall. This is beyond annoying because trying to attack the near boss when the game won't allow you to locate it is not hard, it's stupid. The camera pulls back far enough to find the boss only after you moved close enough to be in it's attack range. Infuriating. Not to mention the camera zooms to the left or right side of the room depending on where you are, so you never know why you still can't see the near enemy. Do I need to move toward the center or closer to the camera?...oh I died.Another common instance is often the in-level shift from &#34;3d&#34; to &#34;2d&#34;. You'll be humming along in a level with the camera showing you depth, then randomly it'll pan to show the classic 2d perspective.Having removed your ability to perceive depth, the game then kills you because while navigating obstacles you pushed Mario too near or far from the camera and fell off the platform. There's no way to know this is happening until you're watching the death animation. The camera stinks.2. Lousy bosses. There are two bosses in this game. Bowser and the spinning/boomerang twins. That's it. Them over and over and over.3. The death system. I don't get this. If I start a level with a suit and then die, I'm immediately put back at the start of the level without the suit. For the impatient, you can try the level that just killed you except in a weaker state. If you wanted retry the level with your suit back, you had to quit to the main menu and reload your save. Huge waste of time. I did this every time I died. The game rewards this behavior btw. I was never offered the super tanooki suit because the game never knew I died on a level 5+ times. If you use the super suit even once, you can't get shiny stars on your save file. I understand being precious with suits to reward good players in NES Mario because there's no save file. Except this is a level based game. If I want to play a given level with a specific suit, I shouldn't have to play another level, retrieve the suit I want, take that suit in the overworld so I can try the other level suited up. That's not rewarding anything.Playing this, I kept reminiscing &#34;remember all those super fun times you died in NES SMB or SM64 because the camera wouldn't let you see where you were going? Ah the memori...wait, that never happened! Those games were actually good!&#34; Everything i wanted and on time", "I absolutely love these games! I had years 1-4 and finished that in about a week so of course I had to instantly buy years 5-7!

Prompt shipping Best Mortal Kombat I think I've ever played, although its missing a few characters I'd really like to see return. Best game of the series Absolutely incredible!

Product came fast and as described. New. I love this series, I think the 4th one is the best, which doesn't appear in this trilogy, but these are still awesome games, one glitch in the third game, FPS slowdowns in one mission in the third game, but aside from that it was awesome, I highly recommend these game/games.", "Got the game for my son.  He loves it. As advertised. Super fast shipping. Children love this game. My son loves the game!", "Nice game A fun family game. My family is having a blast solving puzzles.

When you extend them to make them larger there is just a thin plastic piece which unfortunately snaps super easily and leaves you with a couple of dangling ear pieces which are completely useless. Love them! I bought these not here but at Walmart on 08/23/15 and I gotta say the sound quality is pretty good and the setup was easy too but one thing I noticed was while playing mw3 online I couldn't hear the opponents footsteps while they closed up on me,maybe I didn't set it up right or it's a feature they missed.If somebody can help me out it would be greatly appreciated.

But apart from that, sound effects are really kool, as you can adjust bass & treble. great for gaming and music on my pc These headphones sound amazing and work really well until they stopped working. Not sure if its the headset or my teenage son being too rough with them... This headset's design is defective, probably by choice.They skimped on the plastic quality and did not reinforce the sides properly. If you use it completely normally, never drop it, treat it with perfect care, it will break. Just above the earphones, the plastic cracks if it is only stretched slightly (by doing what we all need to do to use a headset -- put it on), and will eventually break through completely.Don't get me wrong -- the speaker and mic quality are wonderful. But they wanted to keep the price low, and skimped elsewhere. Stay away from this headset, unless you plan on modding it. Nice headphones, worth it if you are a gamer nerd.", "perfect! Good stuff", "Good game, but it doesn't work properly. I am roughly three-quarters into this game and am calling it quits. You cannot save your progress but must depend on &#34;save points&#34; at specific places during the game. This fates you to having to play the same mission over and over and over and over... until (if) you succeed. Due to the tedium of having to repeat the same missions I set the game play to &#34;easy&#34; just so I could accomplish any forward movement through the game.Worse is that if you die, the game throws you back at some random origination point on the map. This requires you drive/run/walk over huge stretches of territory just to get back to the point on the map where you last died in order to continue.Another time I fought my way through a mission but needed to log out of my computer. I thought it would save my progress to that point so I could pick up where I left off. Nope, I had to play through the entire mission, including waiting through those agonizingly long cut scenes again.The game punishes you for playing it; the tedium of repetition of missions and the extent one must go through to get back to where you were should you die, is a huge disincentive for me.The other issue are the graphics; I cannot afford to buy the latest, fastest computer every time a new games comes out. I actually have a two year old &#34;gamer PC&#34; and Nvidia video card, yet I had to set the graphics on the lowest level or the game was too stuttering (laggy) to be playable.And don't even get me started on having to have to log into UPlay to even open the game.It was fun up to a point then the frustration of repetition and tedium has taken it's toll. I am abandoning the game unfinished. Nice Pathetic... I have nothing but problems loading and playing Far Cry 4.  Super long intro that you can't skip, save points are too far apart.  Glitches to the point of unplayable irritation.  It looks great when it works.  I have spent many hours to get maybe 15 minutes into the game.  I'm done...I have never had so many problems with a pc game. I've been having a lot of fun with this!  I'm so glad it does not have the ridiculous &#34;boss battles&#34; from Far Cry 3 that required me to hit various keys in an exact sequence.  Those were a 100% buzz kill!  This game is very similar while being far more engaging and immersive.  Yeah, the radio towers and the crafting are, dare I say it, a little silly.  And the friggin' wildlife is over the top homicidal!  Having a pint-sized dog chase me across a field growling and snapping while I'm bristling with military grade guns and knives is a hoot.  And those eagles!  Has anyone told the game makers that these are carrion birds?  They might stoop on a river trout, but they DO NOT go around raking anything that is likely to fight back with their claws!  It's like they are all having the worst hair (or feather) day of their lives.  But ignore all of this and give the game a try.  If you like open world style adventure games that have tactically oriented FPS action, this is what you want.  Having finished Just Cause 2 recently, I found this to be a large improvement. I'm old in the world of computer gaming.  Lets just say I was already old when Duke Nukem was released.  What I like about this game series is the story line.  It's not too futuristic and actually it's pretty close to any CIA operator's best case scenario.  So it's fun.  It doesn't demand too much of my time and I get to play it when I'm looking for a good distraction between surgeries.  It takes my mind off the pain and it gives me good reason to NOT take the pain meds - which would make it that much more difficult to stay alive in the game.", "Good, but really similar to madden 25, barely changed anything Great purchase, quick delivery. Thank you. Very good Game says &#34;Unable to read disk&#34; 2/3 of the time I turn it on, even though it was supposed to be in very good condition. Also freezes every few uses. Barely playable.

I haven't finished the game yet, but so far on the PS3 it looks great, is a lot of fun and has kept me entertained as my go to ps3 game of choice this year when I have time to sit down and game. Excellent game! I love this game.  Maybe it is the pirate theme (something not done in many video games) or the ship combat (another thing not found in many games) or the tropical atmosphere.  The historical story appeals to me, even though I generally find stories in video games boring.  The modern day component is lacking though, especially for those that appreciated the Desmond story from the previous games.  The sea shanties are so addicting! Amazon had the cheapest price and fastest delivery speed on this game when I bought it. My boyfriend and I both thoroughly enjoyed it. This is my favorite Assassin's Creed to date. A great adventure and addition to the Assassins Creed line. My wife actually played this more than I did though she has little patience for some of the small side challenges. She loves the naval battles, the combat, and the whaling/sharking?. The parts of the game that require stealth, patience and a bit of dexterity with the controller tend to drive her crazy at which point she throws the controller at me and then gets mad when I complete an objective on the first or second try after she's failed it 20 or 30. I like how the map expands as you play and how the game levels up the difficulty too. You get to be an assassin AND a pirate. Enough said. Amazing game, best price I could find.", "needs adaptor for standard headphone jack great", "As advertised. Love it.", "Decent game, wish it had actual dinosaurs Talk about a pay off IGN gave this game 9/10 lol what a joke. They must have played for an hour and proceeded to write their review from that. This game is awesome for the first day maybe even a few day but man does it get old QUICK. If you thought Destiny was repetitive and lacked content wait until you play this, it makes Destiny look like a top 5 all time game. This game has 0 story mode it kind of reminds me of call of duty multiplayer except worse with no campaign mode. So much day one dlc although most has nothing to do with the game you still have to pay to change colors or ad new monster/hunters and for a game lacking in content that stuff should all be free. They also might have the most DLC of all next gen games and it's all useless, instead of spending all that time making dlc they should have mad a campaign mode. At $20 I guess it's worth a try but man does it get boring fast.", "I'm gonna rate this game a 4.4. This is my favorite fighting game on the PS4. The sexiness is a major major plus. But I think it does try to be semi tasteful. The core gameplay is fantastic, as you would expect from a DOA game. You have lots of stuff to unlock, lots of modes to play, lots of characters.Here is one gripe. How many iterations of DOA5 has there been? Plus, Ultimate, then Last Round. Same kinda applies with Street Fighter IV. Lots of versions that add on to the other. But on Last Round, I made the mistake in assuming that all dlc would be included, which it should have been, if it's the final version. And it's painful to scroll through the costumes, and see that there are tons of costumes that are locked because of dlc. It's a horrible teaser. Everytime you play the game, it shoves the costumes in your face and says 'nah nah you don't have this, neaner neaner'. I would have rather it shown me just what I have, and if I wish to purchase more, I would just go on my PSN store.The graphics are superb. Still has last gen roots, but its shiny and looks great. I love the rock paper scissors fighting dynamic. It's the first fighting game I played where I feel like I'm not just button mashing. I love the game, I wish I could give it a 5 star. From a gameplay point of view, it's definitely a 5 star. But that dlc thing really bothers me. Again, I'm fine with dlc, that's just how games are nowadays, but to scroll through the costume options and always be reminded that you don't have these costumes is really cruel. Especially when I paid top dollar for supposed the ultimate version of the game.

Their are a lot of guns to choose from at the start and wen more in the campaign!  The animations are great!  You get slo mo camera when you get a great shot with the sniper gun!  The graphics are Xbox one graphics!  Horse mode is really intense!  You won't be getting to level 30 easily like cod zombies.  This game takes more skill!  I highly recommend this game!  It's truly awesome! I like it", "Extremely hard to get on (said your mom). They rub a lot (said your mom). Works great on my PS4 controllers analog sticks where the rubber was peeling off. They work great and I am pleased with the quality of them and there is only one thing and that is that it's is very difficult to put on the joy sticks just like u said the product would be...thanks great being able to try the different styles and see what works best for you, easy to install and work and last great", "Was a little hard to figure out how to stick all my discs in, but holds them all well. Organizes and keeps them off my desk and floor", "It's good. I just wish that they'd make an actual Persona game like 3 and 4 or even 5 on the 3ds. This game is really awesome! I was never into the Etrian Oddesy games but having the persona characters in it made me pick this game up. Little disappointed I didn't get Tarot cards but that isn't going to stop me from giving it a good review. This game was an awful crossover. It reduced the characters down to stereotypes, making some characters, like Teddie, insufferable. The story is nearly non-existant and replaces S. Links with short cut scenes, leaving major sections without any character interaction or plot development. The combat is awful, getting rid of the 1more system in favor of boost, which was a poorly conceived downgrade. The characters go as a group instead of one by one, so many times a healer would heal themselves because their target died before their turn. I didn't hate the game at first. Even with paper thin characters and downgraded combat, I was enjoying the experience. The date cafe was a particularly fun dungeon that paired you with any character, including the other protagonist. That was right before I realized what this game really is though. Grinding. I watched five hours of cut scenes (which is insultingly low for a persona game), fifteen hours of exploring the dungeons and doing puzzles, and seventy hours of grinding. Persona 3 and 4 were both balanced to make grinding a last resort if you skipped too many fights. Here, it's basically essential if you even want a chance to beat the game. Reducing difficulties does nothing, so this is basically a minimum time requirement to beat the game if you don't exploit the auto-death spells like everyone kept telling me when I asked about the insane time. If I have to exploit poor gameplay to get through the game in a reasonable time, the game is doing something wrong. Do not waste money on this. Buy Persona 4 Arena Ultimax instead, which has DLC for the first games story. It is at least has 200 times more story, the characters aren't cardboard cutouts of their previous selves, and it's a pretty forgiving fighting game with the auto-combo system.[[ASIN:B00KBD4SJA Persona 4 Arena Ultimax - PlayStation 3]]", "On the second 360 with this thing. Works great. It sucks I transferred all my s*** on to my new piece of s*** hard drive and it deleted everything!!!!!!  DONT BUY THIS S***", "I never realized I could use a PS Eye on a PC as a webcam until browsing the web one day.  I really just wanted a microphone to use with Cortana, but for the price, why not get a camera too?  I used third party drivers that are easy to find on Google and installation was a breeze on Windows 10 Pro.  I have a working camera / mic now with excellent picture quality and virtually no motion blur for next to nothing.  There's really no reason to spend more money than this on a &#34;real&#34; webcam when you can have this. Good camera for the price. Excellent, everything is fine.", "not impressed. Overheats. Works great and runs just as well as the original.", "ok Great product, fast shipping.", "Works perfect on xb1 unlike what others have said mic works perfect and so does the sound no distortion great headset. Returned the next day. Mic quality was awful. Alright so I rated the A50's 3 stars for a couple reasons durability, comfort, set-up, and connectivity. Here is why...DurabilityThe two black columns with the green wires inside are made of metal. The rest of the headset is hard plastic. The structure of these things are insanely well put together. Worth 300$ if you go off of that. The ear cups have some sort of memory foam which is really breathable for your ears.ComfortThe A50's are highly comfortable and easily adjusted by pushing up on the black column and down to move them down of course. Again, he ear cups have some sort of memory foam which is really breathable for your ears and is really comfortable to wear.Set-upNow setting these things up is super easy! 3 Cables: Digital in and out cable, power cable, and charging cable. That's it! Super easy and fast set up! Now these are NOT COMPLETELY WIRELESS if you wanna use xbox live chat. You still need to put the chat able in the controller along in the headset themselves.ConnectivityOkay, this is the reason why i returned mine! The first hour or so the headsets were working fine. No buzzing or anything. Perfectly fine! Then out of nowhere my controller starts losing power which in turn causes the controller to constantly disconnect. There was no solution or anything so I returned my headset and went with the Turtle Beach 800X, but thats for another review that I will be writing soon!All in all these headsets are perfect, if you do not want to chat, and just do hardcore gaming!", "It has been well remastered. Excellent game Just the way I expected.....!!!Brutality At its Peak.... Awesome This game sux.  I don't see why so many people rave about it.", "this is our favorite all time game for PlayStation. Ratchet & Clank: Into The Nexus (Ratchet & Clank: Nexus in Europe) was released for PlayStation 3 on November 12, 2013.[6] In this game, Ratchet and Clank, on board the Nebulox Seven Prison Ship, are tasked by Talwyn Apogee to deliver notorious criminal Vendra Prog to the Vartax Detention Centre with Cronk and Zephyr's help. Vendra's twin brother Neftin Prog, along with hired thugs from Thugs-4-Less, stages a jailbreak and frees her. Vendra activates the Nebulox's self-destruct sequence, escaping with Neftin while Ratchet and Clank are flung into space, unable to save Cronk and Zephyr. Ratchet and Clank pursue the twins throughout the galaxy, seeking revenge for their fallen comrades.This installment introduced gravity-based platforming and gameplay, as well as 2D puzzle sequences involving Clank in the Netherverse, a focal point of the game's plot. Arrived on time and as described. Great game and value (comes with a free downloadable title)! Absolutely can't wait for the ps4 version of Ratchet and Clank. Loved this short but very fun game.", "I was extremely excited to get this product because I just bought a PS4 for my nephew's birthday gift last month. I know how he is all into Batman, Robin, and the Joker, so while he was at daycare, I upgraded the appearance of his device and set it on his bed as a surprise.This was important for me to do because I had put another decal on his device to decorate it before first giving it to him, but it began to bubble on the first day from the normal heating while being played. We peeled that one off to find that it left a nasty residue that we had to scrub off with alcohol.This one went a lot smoother. It went on seemlessly and the fit was perfect. There were no air bubbles, and it looks GREAT. Plus it seems to be made from superior quality, and not as thin as the last one.It's been a few days, and he's been playing it a lot. So far there are no bubble pockets forming from the heating, and it still looks as cool as it did on the first day. No edges have come up and it really adds character to what comes as a plain old gaming console. The controller decals went on just as well. Needless to say, he adores the graphics. He was so happy to see it.I would highly recommend.I received this product at a DISCOUNT in exchange for my honest review. This is my personal experience with this product, and reflects my own opinion as it would be if I had paid full price for it. My daughter loves the Joker and just had to have this skin for her Playstation 4.  The skin is a good quality.  It is not thin and the colors are vibrant.  This was my first experience in applying a skin to a PS4.  It was easy to apply and once applied stays in place.  Great product for a gamer who wants to make their PS4 look a little more personal or perhaps just wants a change. I recieved this product at a discounted rate for the purpose of review.  All opinions expressed are my own.", "Lovely Amiibo! I'm glad I got this amiibo.", "Excellent. Both have failed.  Mic goes out and speaker plastic broke.", "Brand new and on time!! It's cheaper built than my original controller, but it has better battery life. Joystick problems already, but at least it's not counterfeit.... i hope not good remote Makes my gaming possible and fun!! Favorite game: Journey :D Works well! I received a genuine controller that works perfectly both for PS3 and PC use. There have been reports of fakes, but this was not one of them. All features work perfectly and the build quality is great. I bought this remote for my sons ps3 cause our dog ate his original remote. This one is just like the original and the seller was fast and reliablet I would purchase again if I needed to. I've only just received it, but everything seems in working order. I'm happy with this buy and am considering buying another if it continues to work and budget allows. i opened mine up because i thought something was kinda wrong...  it did not have the OEM motherboard..  the vib motors has very very thin wire leads... the analogs were not connected to the mother board it used some kinda film circuit..  the battery did not have the standard fasteners  the battery its self had 2 prongs that locked it in to place on to the assembly...  i will give it one star...  because i am forced to..  but it was fake,, i was not built to the same standards as the original sony controller..  i wont get fooled again....", "Didn't even work!!!

This is an excellent item, it will go nicely with the rest of my collection.", "Received it about a week ago and opened it and played with it for a while. You have to mess around with the carts a bit to get them to play sometimes though. Another thing: THE SLOW BUTTON DOES NOT SLOW THINGS DOWN IT JUST REPEATEDLY PRESSES THE START BUTTON! Other than that I love it, cheap and it does its job. I just ordered a second one because the first one didn't work. I thought maybe I just got a bad one. This one does the same thing. Just white and black lines and blocks. I'm so irritated.", "I don't like that you can't use them on the first system but my son is happy that they came out with the super hero's on the 2.0 system.  We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.  Great buy for any family fun or game night. good product. Gift - he loved it. Hulk is a favorite here in our house and was a perfect addition to our Disney Infinity Character family. I just love this item! It's sold out almost everywhere and my son is eager to have this!This character actually is a must-have if you have the Marvel Infinity PS3 Set as there are parts in the game that is specifically for Hulk! HULK SMASH HIT!!!", "He loved it Love the design. Skin is cut perfect to specs of system deminsion. Would rate 5 stars however 3 of the four system skins had bent corners upon arrival. 2 corners being located right at the power button. So definetly an eye sore!", "Nice! Magnificent product. Easy to install. I should of made a video to show the easiest way to install it. However, I do have pictures. I hope this helpful. Pros:-Fitment is good. Its ok if you mis-aligned the skin, you can peel it off and re-align.-Good price for the quality of the product.Cons:-Color is a bit orangey not red like the real MGSV PS4. In a good light you can see the orange hue. But if the PS4 will be in a darker space like indoors or inside a cabinet the color is hue is reddish like the true MGSV PS4.-The prints on the skin isn't sharp. It looks like they were printed on using an old ink jet printer. Far away they look good however.They were readable except for the Diamond Dogs logo where you cant read out the &#34;Diamond&#34; part. (Please excuse my poor photos on the prints. They were just out of focus)-Shipping was a little slow. Prime took me 4 days to ship. This is on the shipper not the product.Bottom Line: If you don't want to import the real MGSV PS4, I'd say this skin would suffice your needs. I would recommend wiping your PS4 with alcohol to clean off dust and oils first. Also using a small squeegee will help.", "Very good headset Best gaming headphones for PC.", "We were surprised at how much fun my grandson had. He said nana that's exactly what I wanted.thankyou Amazon My son loves Skylanders and loves this new one.  Got a great deal on it due to their &#34;black Friday&#34;  deals in July.", "The build quality on the remote is great. It looks great and works pretty well, too. My biggest complaint is that I am unable to control my TV's volume with the remote. I own a Vizio M-Series TV and all other CEC functions work fine. I can turn on my TV by powering on the Shield, it automatically selects the correct input, and I can even control the Shield with my TV remote. But for whatever reason, it will not control my TV's volume via CEC. This is a pretty big deal for me and it's why I am rating it at 2 stars. This means I need to use another remote to control my audio system. I've been communicating with Nvidia support this past week, but there hasn't been a resolution yet (and I can't say their support is all that great either). This may just be a compatibiltly issue with the TV that I own, but either way, it's a big disappointment for me.  Some other minor issues I have: - Fairly big response delay at certain times. I think the remote must go to sleep or something because if you haven't used the remote for a while and then press a button, sometimes the response can take up to a full second. After that first response, all further actions are pretty much instant. - I wish I could turn my TV off with the remote. There doesn't seem to be support for this. - Too expensive. I got mine on sale for half off. I don't think I'd ever recommend it at $50 especially since it can't replace all other remotes.  EDIT: They finally came out with an update recently that addressed the CEC issues. It is now working as expected for my setup. It only took them about 7 months from the time I originally opened up a ticket with their support staff (and many more before me had as well). Amazing Remote I like having this remote for most media.  Too bad the Shield is laggy, especially when trying use the speech option for searching. Perfect This remote is stylish, easy to use and I love the headphone feature. I highly recommend good but should of have an air mouse built in together with it, some cheaper devices comes with a air mouse remote. Super achat Worst UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT AND CENTER in the business and they charge you $50 separately for it. I would rather use the controller which also sucks, but not as much.", "I was skeptical that this would work, but so far, it's great. The battery packs installed easily and charged pretty quickly. As previous reviews have stated, it's a bit finicky as far as the placement of the remotes in the dock. But that's a small price to pay for a good product at such a low price. As long as you get it situated and leave it alone, it's not a very big issue.The shipment also arrived way ahead of the estimated delivery date, so that was nice as well. Packaging was also of great quality.Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase. Worked great for about a month. Now only one dock will charge. Doesn't charge controllers, haven't been able to use my controllers because this charging doc doesn't work.", "They worked and were comfortable. What more could you want from a Playstation headset? great product still  untouch", "I love the Lego games. This one goes so well with the first two movies in the Hobbit movies.

It is a pretty good product and it works, some people are just picky. fast shipping, item was as described", "works perfectly and my 6yr old daughter loves it i picked the 2ds + monster hunter 4.it works like a charmi love it!", "Awesome! Everything the game has to offer gets old real fast.When I first started playing this game, everything was fun and inviting. I was thinking game of the year contender.The combat felt responsive and visceral, as did the stealth kills, as did harvesting herbs with my knife, shooting orcs in the head with my magic arrows, and generally just running around felt right.But everything this game does, (including the graphics and the scenery) ceases to be fun after a few hours.It's all very arcadey, even the difficulty. It's like the game wants you to cough up quarters every time you die. More flexibility in the quest system would have made the game more dynamic, more fun.Enemies can't see you until you're very close, a design choice that makes stealth kills from behind quickly feel cheap and too easy to obtain, and the longer you play, the less fun they are, and imo, stealth kills are the best part of the game.I also died many times because I suck / did not complete the game in the right order.I went off on my own, trying to take down orcs in the order I chose, and rage quit after dying 20 times in a row.I also did not like having to collect magic arrows for my bow. If they're magic arrows, why are they littered all over mordor for you to find? Orcs can't use 'em, orcs can't see 'em. Would have made more sense to put them on a cooldown, give you arrows for free as time passes.The game is, essentially, one man against all the forces of Mordor. And that wouldn't be fun, and it's not.The game doesn't do very many things, and what it does do isn't very good, and you're forced to repeat them over and over and over again.The biggest problem with this game, is that everything you'd want to do in a lord of the rings game, like visit the snowy mountains of cahardras, the dark mines of moria, ride horses across the plains of rohan, see edoras, rivendell, osgiliath, ithilien, fangorn, minas tirith, the forbidden pool, the winding stair, shelob's lair, orthanc, etc etc, you cannot do. it's just a boring endless combat game in a bland, ugly environment that you quickly become bored of being chained to.It squanders the rich lore of middle earth, the hobbit, and lord of the rings.Remember the films? the beautiful colours and the wide variety of environments?The unforgettable characters and villains?Gollum makes a pointless appearance so the ranger can choke him, because every ranger chokes gollum.There's this attempt to rebrand rangers as these uncaring and inhuman people.  None of that s*** is actually in the books.  But yet again, this game reinforces that bulls*** stereotype.None of that is here. why should anyone give a crap about this game? it's not worthy of the middle earth license.It's also got the bioshock vita chamber never really die thing going, which makes no sense for the middle earth universe. I quickly came to hate it, dying over and over with no point but to die again.  It's not a good sign that this is the most interesting part of the game.The ending is anti climactic and feels almost pointlessSPOILER\\\\\"You really want to quit?

Great way to debut the system when it came out and sometimes a good hack and slash is just what you need. I tried to go into playing this game with an open mind, but it became evidently clear that the designers of this game are @ssh0l3s. At least in Tomb Raider Definitive Edition, you have options on how to defeat enemies. Lara's movements are multi planar, but Marius only moves 1 way. Ryse has &#34;combat&#34; button mashing, but you have to do it the same way each time practically against every enemy you face. The graphics of course are the high point of this game (just like 99% of current video games), with a story that is as transparent and 1 dimensional as water. The boss battles are EXCEPTIONALLY annoying. Be prepared to &#34;be defeated&#34; in every section of this game. This game also has the good old auto save which is now an industry standard and run of the mill rip off tool for video games these days. If you pay $60 for this game, then you should have your head examined. very good Cool story mode, but doesnt require a ton of skill.  Graphics are good.

If you play your all of your GameCube games with the thumbstick, please ignore this review. I play all of my GameCube games on the Wii and needed to replace my old controller. I heard positive reviews about the Smash Bros. GameCube Controller and since it was compatible with GameCube games, I purchased one. I tested the controller on all of my games and the controls were very responsive. The thumbstick, buttons, and C-stick were working perfectly, but I quickly discovered something alarming. The D-pad seems to be extremely sensitive to ALL of my GameCube games. When I press up, down, left, or right, it thinks I'm pressing a diagonal input. I play half my GameCube games with the D-pad and I find it frustrating that the controls aren't functioning properly. I know this controller was exclusive to Smash Bros. but it was advertised to be compatible with GameCube games. The D-pad being overly sensitive might be a flaw to these new controllers, so purchase at your own risk. Great for the competitive smasher! Good controller", "Splinter Cell fans should get this! My Boy enjoy this game hard to find thanks Amazon10+", "Beautiful Amiibo! Kids love it, for thier 3ds. Yay amibos", "This is my second purchased, sending one to my little brother, great device for gaming. Being able to play most PS one games, and the psnow service allows ps3 games. Only reason it isn't 5 stars is due to the lack of TV apps. It ships with system software/firmware 3.35 For playing Vita games on TV its very useful And if you have many PSOne classics on your PSN acct. it would be well worth the money other than that don't bother it doesn't have a Netflix app or any other streaming apps So unless you want to play Vita on your TV hold off on this one. But for doing that it works great even though I have rarely used it Ps vita should've been so much more. But it falls flat in almost every regard. Owned an actual vita when they first came out when sony promised AAA titles for it. But when that dream ended, so did my use of it. I sold it a few months after kill zone mercenary came out (last decent game for the console). I bought this for the sheer intent of remote playing to my ps4, especially since it came down in price so severely. So I had both my ps4 and ps tv hardlined to the same network, and to my surprise... IT SUCKED!! Terrible lag, video quality sucked, and lost connection a few times. So I packed it up and sent it back that same day. Sony needs to figure out how to make this ACTUALLY WORK. I love the idea of remote play, but I have never been able to enjoy it successfully It might be an incredible flop but I really like mine. Once the hackers finally get some custom firmware that's easy to load it's going to make this thing worth it's weight in gold. Some sort of hack that enables USB storage and instead of those terrible proprietary memory cards will make a huge difference.

The Playstation TV/Vita is amazing! works great too! using my ps3 controller to control the ps4 system through this.*Note: a fast router is recommended.", "Decent, does not register when you push down the triggers half way, only registers in a full press, which can mess you up in certain games. the c stick only works on the y axis.", "This product is similar to other energizer chargers. However, I have to agree with other reviews that the controllers are a bit more difficult to place than some of their other designs. I selected it since I wanted it to match my Xbox One control charger, which is does, but it is a bit more difficult to place the PS4 controllers than the other charger. Works extremely well! Have been using for the past month or so and have had zero troubles. Controllers are always fully charged and charge very quickly. The different colors from when charging and is fully charged is very helpful. Great charger to prominently display!  Works with both standard black and colorful controllers.

This sucks got it today can't play it cause it won't download Great I've been playing since a week after launch and have completed everything multiple, multiple, multiple times (you have to if you want good gear). The actual gameplay is a blast and the first raid is fantastic, but there are a myriad of issues. The story is boring, all the NPC's constantly speak in vague metaphors, the multiplayer crucible is a lag fest with cycles of unbalanced weapons, and it can be tough to find a roster of dedicated friends. All of the people I played with originally (people I knew) have quit playing. Then I found a lot of people through LFG and eventually settled into a new group. These people also quit after the first and second expansion. Now I mostly play PvP/Trials, and go to LFG to find more rando's to play with for PvE stuff. Honestly, not a great game to start up on because you'll have to grind forever to get the good gear, and let's face it - the human brain's susceptibility to addiction will keep you playing this game LONG after you finish the story or even finish playing for the sake of a good time.  As of the next expansion, I will be joining the ranks of others who have &#34;given up the habit&#34; and walked away from this game. It's a grinding game...got bored. AMAZING GAME every one should have it A I really enjoyed this game....until I became level 34 and bought a gjallahorn. Now the game is pointless to me. There is no trading system, content is restricted to fire teams only, which if your friends dont have the game or they are not online, you wont be playing.  if you like repeating the same thing over and over but with different modifiers, then this game is for you. Sad this came from Bungie dam thing has no story to it feel like i was robed", "It's works perfectly they did not work. defective", "Great buy I really enjoy it. This is a great system, and when I got it from the seller it was in very good condition. I now am using this product all of the time. Thank you! play it all the time love it Runs great, easily modifiable. With a few other products, I now have a pocket emulator with hundreds of games and great battery life. 100% advisable", "I have never played a game with as much load time as this game. The wait time for loading is constant, from anything as pausing the game to check the map to gaining new intel on enemy captains. And the wait time itself is atrocious. It takes forever for anything to load. As well, the game has a lot of difficulty rendering its own pieces and environments. When you pause, for example, and it shows an enemy captain, it takes the game a few moments as it loads the character layer by layer (so first you have the basic outline, then some armor, then some more armor, then some new color shades, etc). It does this with the  overworld map, too, especially at night. You take a step one direction and the ground appears very bright in color (as far as the camera can see). Take a step in another direction and suddenly everything is dark again. There are lots and lots of little bugs like this that really should have been worked out before release. It makes for a very poor gaming experience (especially the never-ending load time).It is a fun game and all, but it could be so much better just with basic fixes. Boyfriend loves the game!", "Makes the XBOX One controller much more comfortable for me. Good deal. Great shipping speed A+++", "not sure what the seventh game is on here but all in all a good buy I didn't realize it was a brand new unopened game. That made this purchase even sweeter! LOVE megaman", "My grandson loves it awesome!", "My son was happy with his Xbox One and all the goodies it came with. Worked fine since the day I bought it and still is running like a dream. There have been so many issues with this console. The OS is a piece of junk that freezes and sputters its way through existence. The hardware is large, bulky and is always running hot. I do not recommend this system. I will most likely buy a PS4 as a replacement for this mistake. The Xbox is great.  But the packaging was terrible.  The box was ripped down the front and every corner was worn.  Thankfully so far there seems to be no damage to the device. Excellent idea to have it all together for a gift. It made my gift giving job so much easier. Okay, this thing is dumb. It is way too dependant on internet connection, and it slows my house's connection down, a lot.  I haven't been able to even play Assassin's Creed, because it is too slow to download. I left my xbox on, downloading, for 24 hours, and it got to 18%.  The only reason I'm even giving this a 3/5 is because the two games I've purchased (hard copy) have been amazing.If you get this system be sure to get Batman: Arkham Knight and Rare Replay. Xbox 1 is more tempormental then Xbox 360 but Microsoft is always standing by if you need them ship speed too slow\uff0cbut the machine is good Best deal and price! The system out My sons are adicted to this xbox! The visuals are amazing and the quality of gaming is impressive. Even I like to sit and watch them play since it feels realistic and you can easily get into the game experience. It works fine except for the disc slot, it'll accept the game but not read the disc Controller was a little rough, not in the best of shape at all, the system itself was slow to get moving but now working much better, so not perfect but for what I paid for it, I would say its good.", "One of the best games on ps4 Wolfenstein nails it again with an awesome storyline incredible graphics on the ps4 and one of the best game I played on the ps4 would highly recommended get both of them Nice add-on for the classical Wolfenstein fan.

As in any game, it takes a couple of playing hours to get accustomed to the various ways of playing, but that isn't a big deal. Simulations seems realistic enough, some penalties are frustrating but -I guess- it's my fault as I am still mastering how to play. I changed the setting from &#34;rookie&#34; to the level higher (&#34;pro&#34;, maybe?) and I see a huge difference in the players' behavior. Anyway, great game to spare some time when outside is too cold, raining or snowing. Don't like it compared to previous years.  Too many big hits and the option for opponents to force you to fight is annoying.  Will probably skip next year's unless they make some changes.", "Never stops playing it! Love this game! I was in fantastic condition when it arrived.", "My daughter loves it. Can't be used on my system even though it says MAC/PC compatible.  Apparently my MAC does not have enough memory however the sims box does not specify. I waited to get the Sims 4 until about a week ago, as I wait for every Sims upgrade, and really any game upgrade the I know will come with expansions, etc. Why? Because when you buy a new version of a game that you have every expansion and mod known to man for and then have to revert back to playing just a base game without even bug fixes, it's always going to suck. Always. So, I've waited til there was a sale (because no Sims base game is worth $60) and picked up the basic version. Since I waited, many of the issues (no pools, no dishwashers, etc) were fixed with game patches. This is the case with pretty much every game anymore, so be aware that many &#34;huge&#34; or &#34;unfixable&#34; issues people were freaking out about have already been fixed.First, yes, it definitely is different than the Sims 3. In a lot of ways, this is great. I don't mind a 5 second load screen between locations when it means I don't have a 5 minute load time initially. The Sims 3 took forever to get up and running, and that always annoyed me. Also, the world is what I'd call &#34;semi-open&#34;. There are little neighborhoods that the Sims seem to be able to pop around in without a load screen, and when your Sim is out of their home lot, you still have partial control over the sim at home (you can make them &#34;take care of self&#34; &#34;build skill...&#34; and other general activities). Relationships also take A LOT longer. My first household was two Sims living together, and they aren't in love after like a day. It does seem a big more organic and not like it takes TOO long based on the Sim's lifespan. However, if you want to have a Don Juan/Juanita type Sim, it'll definitely be harder.One of the things I do miss, kind of, from the Sims 3 is Create-a-Style. I thought I'd miss it way more than I do, though. For sure, I miss being able to make custom hair colors and modify make up colors. Even with mods, not all the mods have the exact same color of hair and soyou kind of end up stuck using one creator's hair styles. Generally, it's not a problem if you want to use someone like Skysims or Nightcrawler because they already have lots of styles out, but if it's a newer mod creator it can be annoying since they don't have like 100 hairstyles I can choose from. I also miss being able to change the bed linen colors, and the walls. However, there are a lot of built in options so generally, I was able to find something I liked fine in the base game as far as furnishings. Of course, we'll get more and better furnishings each time we pony up for an expansion pack, or if you go and look at thesimsresource.com or modthesims.com. MOST experienced Sim players already mod their games to hell and back, so I think losing Create-a-Style hasn't been as bad as it could be, but I do wish it was available for the less tech savvy among us who can only download and install custom content, as opposed to creating it (If you aren't downloading custom content from the above sites, I encourage you to start. They have content for ALL Sims games and instructions on how to add it to your game. It's very easy and really fun!).A handful of items are &#34;unlockable&#34; by achieving certain things (like reaching the top of a career or something). Since I mod my games into oblivion, the idea of unlocking an item is kind of a fun side-quest type thing, as opposed to super annoying given the small amount of items overall.Build mode is different, but I think it's MUCH better. First, there are premade rooms, which is a nice shortcut when building. Second, roofs are far more complex now. There's no auto-roof, but it's not as difficult to make cool looking roofs anymore, either. It's hard to explain how build mode is different, exactly, but it seemed easier to use. Buy mode has to be accessed through build mode, and has the same options of searching by room or by item type. Buy mode confused me for a second but I don't mind it now.You also only get three traits per sim! That part is kind of dumb. Maybe an university pack will allow a fourth, or something, but it still seemed kind of light on the personality and I wish I could have added two more traits. :( Additionally, I think some of the skills are less intuitive. For example, you have to find an actual fishing spot to fish, as opposed to just clicking on the water or looking for a school of fish. I had to ask Google for help on that one. lol But there are more skills, so there's that.As far as similarities, in the base game, you control your Sim at work the same way, with a handful of options. You can textOne of the new additions I didn't think I'd care about but kind of like now is the emotions. It's more complex than &#34;Sim has to pee&#34; &#34;Sim is hungry&#34; or what have you. The emotions stack, and modify each other, and while they sometimes relate to the needs (such as being uncomfortable or bored), other times they're outside the needs or sparked from other activities. Sims in certain moods can do extra things, not just with other Sims but with the world around them. This includes special paintings (there are WAY more options for painting now, in general), and getting embarrassed from sucking at playing an instrument (as well as making other sims &#34;tense&#34; because they suck). It helps make up for the lack of traits (still mad about that though, I'll be honest) and I think it could be fun as you get further on.Overall, I think Sims 4 is a solid game. I haven't been tempted to go back to Sims 3, which I kept installed just in case, and I don't find myself fast-forwarding through everything or cheating to keep my Sims from freaking out and having low needs. I only have the base game at the moment, but I've probably added 100 items via mods. The expansions are cheaper this time around, it seems, but I'm entertained enough to wait. I know a lot of people are pissed about Sims 4, but Istill think it's worth playing and trying. A lot of people were pissed about Sims 3 as well. People just hate change, especially gamers. That being said, I think I would still encourage you to wait for a price drop or an Origin sale, since it's a lot less frustrating to buy a $35 game and think, this is okay but I wish it had more, and paying $60-70 for a game and thinking the same thing. I bought this for my grand daughter and she was happy with it so so am I. I have not played this game much yet but I do not love the way that the controls for the camera work. In The Sims 3 you could control the tilt of the view, and so far it seems you can not do that in The Sims 4. It bothers me.", "Great unit. Son  loves it It was good It's a Playstation 3 Super Slim. It works perfectly and comes with a controller, and all the proper cables. Just what I ordered, no complaints.", "Just started playing this game and a few hrs into it. It's not as action filled as I though. I'm hoping as I get more into it , it will be. I can say he can do some amazing things as he collects relics and trades them for power re s. Really cool powers.the beating heart guides him. Then you have the old relic bones that give him powers. Kinda cool. Just a bit slower for me to get I n to this one.I'll 're review as I play it or after I finish it. $30 is fair and the game is great. Not much of a visual change from the goty version I bought last time. Good game, not worth $40 The game itself is amazing and the Doud DLCs are good enough. The problem is this one edition. This is not a remaster as much as a port. There are zero gameplay changes and few graphical improvements over the PS3 version. More importantly, it is slightly worse than Dishonored GOTY for PC, which has FAR better graphics, better load times, and no glitches. The PS4 version looks sharp, and if you don't have a med-high end PC (and have the patience to put up with the load times...) you'll enjoy it because it's a great game that still looks awesome. But for anyone else this is a huge waste of money at either $20 or $40. Consider buying the GOTY edition for PC for a mere $20 on Amazon or $30 on Steam: it will look as good as the PS4 edition with just a mid-tier graphics card. And now we wait for Dishonored 2... There isn't much going on with this edition, I would wait for a price drop. It's nice to get all of the DLC, and to not have the screen tearing the PS3 version had, but other than that it doesn't have much going for it. The graphics are slightly faster and sharper, but not as good as the PC version on mid settings. I got it on PSN for $19.99 because I got the PS3 one free with PS Plus. At $19.99 with all of the DLC, it is worth it, but $40, come on.1 Star down for the retail price. I miss Dishonored and playing it on the ps4 makes everything complete! This will get the PS4 generation on possibilities of 100 percent &#34; Ghost  &#34;  and the future for Dishonored 2 and co-op and so fourth. i played this pile of junk before I think Christopher reeve was still alive during that time as well so why would they release it again let the man rest inn piece If you've never played Dishonored before or haven't bought any DLC for the 7th gen system, buy it, hands down, no questions asked. If you bought it and the accompanying DLC for 7th gen, hold off. Here's why: (Full disclosure: not very far into the game but far enough to compare it to the PS3 version) With Borderlands: The Handsome Collection and the Shadow of Mordor, There was a noticeable difference in either gameplay (Shadow) or graphics (Borderlands), Dishonored has barely better graphics than the PS3 version and the gameplay isn't noticeably smoother either. While borderlands carried over their comic-book style graphics, they did manage to clean them up quite a bit, Dishonored didn't do that. As far as gameplay goes, the load times are quicker and that's where it stops. The biggest advantage you get is the DLC, that's what makes the game worthwhile to buy new. Unless you never play Dishonored on PS3/360/PC there is no reason to purchase this. this version is barley even &#34;Definitive&#34;. this game deserves better This game is a 4.5. The core gameplay is fantastic. The ps3 to ps4 upgrade is very nice and very appreciated.  The issue at hand here is the port or remaster, whatever you want to call it. There are great remasters out there. Tomb Raider from PS3 to PS4 is one of them. I still know some PC gamers that are jealous because the PS4 Definitive Tomb Raider is better than their PC Tomb Raider. As for PS4 Dishonored, if you have a high end PC and a PS4, just stick with the Dishonored PC that you already have. But to answer the question, is this PS4 Dishonored better than PS3 Dishonored. Yes, very much so. Graphically.  There are some great port jobs out there. TLOU, GTAV. PS3 to PS4, you can tell worlds of difference. I hear the Prototype PS3 to PS4 port is no good. I played Sleeping Dogs PS3 and PS4 versions. On that version, I can see the minor improvements. Improvements though minor makes a huge difference when you're playing a game for hours. I would say Dishonored gets a B+ on the port job. They could have done better, but I appreciate the end product they came up with.  Definitive editions tend to price drop like a brick fairly fast. I bought this game brand new at Gamestop just this morning and have been playing it and having a blast doing so. You can wait till this game hits your price point, but yes, this game is a must buy if you don't have a souped up PC to play it in.  Watch PS4 gameplay on twitch and or live from playstation. You can see the difference between the ps3 and ps4 versions. Draw distance is much better. Textures are slightly improved. Lines are finer. It still has an oil painting quality to it. You can still tell the old gen roots in the game. Overall, Highly recommend.  P.S. When the heart tells you secrets, you can hear it in the Dualshock speakers. How cool is that?", "Lots of profanity.  otherwise, good game. Excellent FPS action and single-player story telling.  The villains are genuinely threatening and scary in the way that the best movie villains are.  Not much more can be said about this that has not been covered in other reviews, just wanted to vote. Good", "This was a huge disappointment when compared to the great game that is Borderlands 2. The dialogue is bland and the game just feels like a huge step backwards. Gearbox owes us a great game. BORDERLANDS 3. It is a giant expansion of Borderlands 2.  If you like that fast and furious combat-centric action of Borderlands 2, you should like this.  It is set on a moon with low-gravity, so think of it as Borderlands where you can bounce around and use anti-grav pads to jump 50 feet in the air during combat.  Fun single player action.", "I get my money's worth out of it. Worked great for 2 years. After that, died. Had professional try to repair. No.", "I purchased this for my New 3DS XL. Inside the case came a usb charger cable, a car charger, three plastic game cases, two styluses, headphones, and a screen protector for the touch screen. I did not receive a screen protector for the top screen as pictured. The bottom screen protector is fine. The headphones are dollar store quality and I will give them to my niece because they will match her pink DS lite. The cases for games are fine. I haven't used the piece that goes into the car because I have one that I love already. The usb cable works well. I received a pen - like stylus  and another small stylus that appears as though it will fit into my niece's ds lite. It didn't fit into my 3ds. The case itself is not overly bulky but does the job to protect my 3ds. I have dropped it onto my kitchen floor and my ds is fine. It also fits my 3ds even though I have a protective case on it as well. Time will tell how well everything holds up but I am pleased with my purchase. I do wish I did get that top screen protector though! My granddaughter loved it.

Great game,  and I ordered it on a Sunday and received it on a Tuesday. Being a Witcher fan, I must say this was the buggiest of all the Witcher games, imho.  I didn't have any memorable problems with the first two, but this one has many flaws.  Broken quests, bugs that require you to save then reload (which itself takes a ridiculous amount of time).It's the Witcher, as done by a large publisher (WB).  That means basically a generic open world game (skinned as the Witcher), complete with tons of mindless collection quests.  There's nothing really new or unique here, unless you count the almost laughable character control; the biggest challenges in the game involve running up to a door at just the wrong angle and trying to correct it, only to end up at best doing a weird, frustrating sort of back-and-forth dance, or, at worst, falling off a mountain.I'd say &#34;Ditch WB and big publishers&#34; to CD Projekt Red, but they're making too much money to listen to someone like me. Boring!I am very disappointed. Game was okay. Something different.", "Classic! Best game ever", "The girl I bought it for loves it. im a sims fan", "hubby love this games I am a fan of open world games, but missed playing this one on the PS3.  I decided to try the PS4 version and while I found it enjoyable, it's not among my favorite open world games.  I found the learning curve in the beginning to be a little steep.  I never could quite get down the mechanics of fighting.  Sometimes Wei would just stand there as I was hitting the buttons to get him to move.  I'm not sure if it was because I was mashing the buttons too hard or if it was a glitch.  Luckily, you can buy upgraded outfits that come with weapons.  The game became much easier once I had a sword and a gun.  Still, there were little bugs where my gun would randomly disappear or Wei wouldn't pick up a knife that was dropped by another enemy.I was able to overlook the glitches because this game is fun overall.  I loved driving around the open world of Hong Kong.  It was fun to play a game that wasn't set in the U.S.  The game features lots of side missions that I enjoyed playing.  My favorite side mission was the drug bust one where you have to hack a camera and then catch a criminal remotely.  The characters in this game slowly grew on me.  At first, I found them all rather irritating, but Wei and his best friend grew on me to the point where I cared what happened to them.Overall, this game is worth playing if you're a fan of open world games.  It's a great value and it comes with all of the DLC.  I enjoyed playing it while waiting for the blockbuster games to come out this year.", "Had a few scuff marks but nothing a magic eraser couldn't take care of great condition and no yellowing Something rattling around inside, but it works fine.

The noise was fine with me. But first time I unplugged it and moved it somewhere else. Turned it on to play and now it turns off on me randomly. Only bought cause the price but bad choice I guess. great job Was delivered quickly. Works well, motor is a little noisy Do not order waste of time and money Great item and great price.", "Not really. Good Great console!", "Really great GTA game for DS! Worth having it! :D None", "excelente Excellent game I'm a big AC gamer and started from the beginning in this franchise.  I understand the fact that they had to recycle old games to make this in order to put more members on making the PS4 version but this game was so glitchy that I just wanted it to end...Obviously Ubisoft doesn't care and won't be much bothered my review but I wish they put more effort out of respect to their loyal customers!I miss the Ezio series when I couldn't wait to get home to play and even had dreams about the mission.  Hope the PS4 brings better AC games with it! Best one yet!", "I really like it Thanks u Amazon I love this game more than I love my life.", "Pretty good It feels nice and has a ferm grip Great grips! My PS4 grips were getting worn so I got these, and they fit great. Definitely recommended! Took me a day or two to get used to them, but they fit both my PS4 controllers perfectly, and the grip is so much better! The rubber on both of my controllers was tearing off, but these solved the problem instantly. Better than before. These look spectacular, and fit the controller (360) very well. However, they feel more plastic-like than rubbery, which makes for something of a slippery grip. That, combined with the fact that the studs are a little too big for comfort, means there are better choices out there.", "Awesome game. Fun game. Gets a bit &#34;grindy&#34; after a while. I would probably skip this version, however, and get most recent pack (The Taken King bundles will soon be out). A cross between borderlands and halo for the most part. Nowhere in the description says that you need to be connected online to play this game.  Keep this in mind if you plan to buy.  Waste of money, thanks Bungie for saving me 20$ that i can spend in a better game. Can't stop playing it....So addicting! I think I dream about destiny!", "grate Awesome game if you love the series!", "Good love it The songs are great and the game play has improved. My chief complaint is the excessively long load time. All of the hot songs, with good routines. The whole family can play (& the company bleeps out the bad words). a good workout, too! Too bad some inappropriate songs were included (I.e., Bang Bang) Wife loves it - nothing else needs said :) Prepare to sweat your dance off.  This game is fun and has some interesting song choices.  Always a good time. Great product, did exactly what I needed to do :-) Got for the kids but they seemed to lose interest.  Needs more songs...and not the purchase type. Good", "Thanks! I really do like this guitar, my kids have a great time with it. I only gave it 4 stars because the top part of the guitar handle was broken off when we got it and I think it is kind of expensive for a toy to come broken. But it didnt affect the way it played and the kids didnt want to give it up long enough to send it back so we just superglued it and it looks ok.", "I don't like that you can't use them on the first system but my son is happy that they came out with the super hero's on the 2.0 system.  We got these for our children as a Christmas present and we have had hours of family fun playing the games and fighting together and against each other.  The characters are made form the same plastic as the first one and if you step on certain ones they will break but they are pretty sturdy compared to that.  We bought the carrying case and the display case to make sure they were always put up so they would not break like they did on the first system.  Great buy for any family fun or game night. recommended. Gift - he loved it. Just perfect", "Great price, but only lasted about a month before it stopped working I was hesitant b/c the other reviews were so back and forth, but it works great. We haven't had any issues and use it almost every day", "Gave as gift -- Son loves it. Excellent a whole lot of fun", "whoever thought these headphones are worth 300 bux is seriously kidding themselves. Awful surround sound, volume extremely low. Waste of money, these are suppose to be the best headsets on the market for ps4, very disappointed. Most of the eq presets are useless. Using &#34;movie signature sound&#34; preset for almost everything. But still, overall experience - nearly perfect.", "My kids love Lego. We bought this for my son for xmas cause he played it at a friends house and loved it.  It was a game the whole family can play and it has some adult humor that I think is over my kids heads, or at least my husband and I laughed and they didn't.  Great game.  Legos is always a family event. This game  is great but can be beat fairly quickly. I have a 7 year old and a 9 year old and they are allowed to play 2 hours of video games a week. They beat this game fairly quickly and were both like &#34;That was it???&#34; I guess I expected more from a Lego video game. They still loved it they just wish it would have taken longer to beat it. Compared to other Lego games, this one is poorly executed. Not entertaining at all.", "Awesome Awesome game I mean it Madden football....if you like football buy it!", "I love it! The system layout is nice and the graphics are so much better. The only thing I haven't gotten used to is where the stylus is located at. Best console i've ever bought. My custom gaming PC is little more than a google machine since ive had this. if you like pokemon get this. if you like mario get this. if you like social games get this. if you like puzzle games get this. This thing puts all mobile phone games to shame.Do wish the battery life was a little longer. But i do have it on almost 24/7. I'm 23 years old i have larger hands than average. and this XL is just barley the right size. if you have much larger hands you may find it uncomfortable to hold. This $200 console does NOT come with a charger!  I knew it does not come with a charger and I didn't order one with the console because I thought the charging port is one of those universal usb type connectors which I have a few chargers for. It turns out the port is a proprietary Nintendo connector that requires a different charger with this connector type. The unit lasted about 20mins out of the box. I tried to get one locally, but it was out of stock after visiting TWO Target and a Super Walmart in my area. my grandson adores this , I'm happy he is happy! My son ordered this and he has really enjoyed it.", "Product as described, quick delivery.  Thanks. Great game for the gamecube", "PERFECT! Thank you!! Horrible doesn't work. I wanted it for my little children that have a hard time with the wii controller. Very upset.", "works great.. Works just like new :)", "It was great just what I needed. Prefect! Just what I was expecting to receive. I love the length of the cord itself.", "Amazing for price First thing I noticed was the mic quality is exceptionally bad. I didn't expect anything great, but an 8 dollar external mic is better than this. 2nd thing is that the build quality is pretty bad. Chunks of plastic have started crumbling off the sides only after 2 months of light use. This hasn't affected performance directly, but I worry about how long this chunk of plastic is gonna stick together. The audio quality is great though, which makes it a shame that these 2 issues really bring down the whole product. These headphones are great!  I decided to splurge on a nice pair of headphones, and these are rad.  They're SUPER comfortable.  However, it only has a single audio port for input and output, so if your device has a separate microphone jack then you'll either need to get a 3-&#62;4 3.5mm audio converter (converting output + input into a single cable that plugs into the headphones for the mic) or you'll need to use the USB attachment (which is a HUGE cord)", "It was a pleasure to get two of these controllers for one price and they worked perfectly.  My husband plays his Nintendo NES daily. they do not work Delivered on time", "My daughters (ages 11 and 7) both love this game.They never seem to get tired of the songs and enjoy being able to play with other people around the world. Quite nice. You should try it Okay THIS GAME RULES! Our kids love this game for some reason.  We have a 11 year old boy and a 7 year old girl, and this game is perfect to let them run off some energy on rainy or days that are way too hot to go outside.  You need some space for this game, at least 10X10 if you have more than 2 people playing at a time.  One person can play this in a 5X5 ft area.  This keeps the kids moving for 30-60 minutes straight.  Great workout, great cardio.  Really recommend that you have the PS camera for this game.  Not nearly as fun if you have to hold the controller.", "great product I like the older version of Doom much better.  It played very well on a PC from the disk.  Having to run this through Steam is crap.  What ever happened to just being able to install a game and play it?  Having to create an online log in and play is a pain.  Also, I couldn't get the game to work - it kept freezing in the opening credits.  I confirmed my system was compatible so the game is just crap.", "Worked exactly as advertised right out of the box! Seems to work well.  My son hasn't complained about it.", "Probably the funniest game of all time! Could play it all day! I mean your assissian don't get any cooler then that Great deal, what I wanted", "It's fantastic it works great I ordered the US version but received the Japanese version??? Definitely not US version It came in as a perfect package. Perfect", "Game is very short and does not have a lot of boss fights. Does not give the same feel as sonic generations on console. The best thing about this game was playing through classic sonic stages. This isn't really a review, but mostly what I like about this game in my opinion.Although shorter than the Xbox 360/PS3 version, Sonic Generations for the 3DS is still a fun game...BUT I wish there were more levels. They didn't even include a stage from Sonic Heroes, though I suppose the Special Stages and stage select soundtrack make up for it...I guess. One thing both versions of the game did do right however was using Chemical Plant Zone and Casino Night Zone from Sonic 2 as in my opinion those were the best, memorable stages of that game. The rival battles here were meh...not really special to me and the Time Eater boss I have to admit was less frustrating than the 360 version.The stages are lush and beautiful especially Casino Night, Tropical Resort and Emerald Coast. A nice memory of my Sonic Adventure DX days making me wish that they ported Sonic Adventure to the GBA or DS. 2D stages of that game would've been interesting.If Sega decides to do another Generations game during Sonics 25th or 30th anniversary I'd want a full 3D version of the original classic Sonic the Hedgehog.Like most reviews here the game can be beaten in a few hours but Mission mode will surely keep players coming back. I've finished all missions and got S rankings in every stage so there's not much else for me to do then to improve my profile card. Pick this game up if you're a Sonic fan and want to relive those days of the Genesis and Dreamcast/Gamecube. Or else watch the playthrough videos on youtube to see how the game plays.", "Good item Great expansion to the third installment of this game franchise. Only marginally better than the great abomination that is Diablo 3 because the auction house no longer exists so items that drop actually help you. But wait! You can't trade any of your items. Props to Blizzard for ruining fun for everyone at a level once thought to be unfathomable.", "Bad ass! Five stars of all the gta's this is the most fun and does anyone know if is two player like it was ps2", "The stand itself is good.  I like the style as well but it's not that easy.  The stand part is very simple.  The charges placement is bad.  I like it that it doesn't use your standard charging place to charge.  It uses the place where you use your headphone but it's kinda difficult to get in if the ps4 is already in stand.  If you have to do else,  it defeats the purpose of easiness hence you'll be removing the stand many times over the time that you keep this v  took me a little struggle to get the charger on it.  I don't suppose that'll be the last time Great product, works like it says and its good for it to stand up (in my opinion) because the bottom doesnt heat up.", "This game was shipped pretty fast but i give this a four stars because it didn't come with the original box and the disc had light scratches on it. My son likes this game plays it all the time.", "So here is my two cents on this product.. i previously had a type pad for my ps3 which had mechanical keys like a keyboard essentially aka hard shell keys u press on to type a letter.. however this product has a soft rubber feel on the keys.. it definitely takes some getting used to because u can't type as fast as u do like on a phone for example. So u have to slow urself down alotttt. But it does a decent job at what it's supposed to do which is type faster and easier than using a in game keyboard like when u play a mmo such as final fantasy 14 or when using the Internet on the ps4. It's a okay product but not worth the money in my eyes. There has been a wait to get this product but I can see why. It's prity nifty. The little knob on the actual pad comes in handy when you type. Easy to use and install. I like that they put a headset jack on the pad so you can still have the option to connect a pair if you like.", "Product was excellent I recommend R-Rsales The controller plays extremely well! I looks almost brand new! I recommend this seller!", "Does not work. Poor quality vable Very good quality, works well, great price, and shipped very fast.", "Very easy to apply and something I highly recommend to anyone looking to protect their system. I would recommend this product to ANYONE with a NEW 3DS XL. This is AMAZING at putting a screen cover on. The step-by-step helps you put the screen on with little to no bubbles at all. Worth EVERY cent. Thank you so much!! Perfect for both my children's New Nintendo DS's! Love it! Barely know it's there (had to double check once I took off the protective layer). We've had ours on the DS's for over a month and there are no signs of peeling. Great for us! Fits perfect and it does it job.", "Helldivers is hella fun!Seriously, right now, I cant think of a better co-op experience. The action is tense, the maps look cool, and the enemies are tough without being overwhelming, and even when they roll over you, the game never feels cheap. You can revive yourself as long as you are still able to crawl, a teammate can expedite the process, and if you do die, your teammates can set a beacon that revives you. There are a ton of upgrades to your weapons, special abilities (which take the form of calling in ammo, special equipment, ally revives, etc...), and so on. There are two different vehicles your team can pile into that are also armed. The missions make sense.Anyway, this twin stick squad shooter basically gets everything right. You will want to play this. Not worth 39.99. Maybe 19.99 at best.  Gets boring quick good! This is most useful and it includes all DLC.", "I am extremely happy with this purchase of a modified ps4 with 2 Tb of memory.  The seller provided amazing customer service in support of their product.  The system came new with the upgraded completed with precision.  The seller provided pictures of the quality of the work and product prior to shipping.  The ps4 is hooked up and running perfectly.  The system came new with a controller, chat board, dual charging system, the last of us remastered, and the standard accessories for hooking up the system.  I would highly recommend this seller for any gamer looking to upgrade their systems. Great product, expedient and thorough service!", "Nice product It works perfectly and costs less than a wireless controller. I would 100% recommend it.", "Great game came on time Very well", "still better than most all games to this very day! i cant count how many times ive beaten the game! :D Good as always!!", "Excellent recommend 100% Poor Great game great gameplay.", "Thank you for  the replacement and it meets all of our expectations . Thank you again Works great at a great price", "Good and robust case. Hard case with lots of room. this case is amazing!! It fits my new 3ds  xl with my clear protective case on it..  Check out the pix if you dont believe me. Great quality, well worth the price.", "EXCELLENT this was one of the best purchases i have ever made! I got my games and xbox for cheap with no problems and it is still going strong! I guess they built the hardware better in this one then the white ones. Got this on a whim a couple years back.Love the package that is given.Tons of stuff for a real steal of a price.Still works good, not a single problem!", "Love this game. Incredible game! The fastest F-Zero in the series! Superb graphics and insane racing tracks. One of my favorite racing games. I'm glad I bought it, and am now replaying one of the major games of my childhood.", "I should have read the reviews before I bought it. Same problem with no connection to my TV. Just a blank screen that says no signal. I am able to the hook up the original NES just fine with its cables.DON'T buy it if you want to play N64. It doesn't work. My son wasn't optimistic when I first ordered this cable but once he received it, he was beyond thrilled that it worked! Allowed my old SNES to work. Yay! It works and that is all that matters!", "Easy installation looks great excelente", "The controller is in very good condition but the Start button needs to be pressed harder than the other buttons,, that is the reason for the 4 star rating, I recommend this seller. Brings me back! Item arrived quickly and works great!", "Great gift idea It&#34;s perfedt!", "Terrible purchase. I bought four so I could constantly have two in the controllers and two on the chargers. Im glad I did. These things do NOT hold any type of charge. They start giving the &#34;low battery&#34; signal within 20 minutes of being off the charger, even if they have been charging overnight. You get what you pay for in this case, and I would rather spend a little bit extra to stop constantly swapping batteries. After only a few uses I pull this off the re-charger and it fails right away.", ":) My kid love this. So cool", ":) Another interesting piece for my collection!", "Is gud Great headset. Definitely worth buying.", "Received these the other day and one of the wheels had a piece chipped on the side. Since ordered a replacement Well they are tiny. Was really disappointed on the size. But all in all packaging was horrible. But Wii remote fits and it works.", "was as stated Excellent product and seller!", "Great product! The cartridge is in near prefect condition and plays very well! anything with mario is great Its a nice game", "A little hard to program, but once is done works perfect! Its my firstime having a game controller for my phone to play with and im excited about it.  But i have games that requires most of the button.  This controller is excellent but i notice that r2 button have not functioning right.  I will give it 6 stars if everything is there when i bought it.", "My boys love this game and ..... I have to admit: this is the only game that I like to play with them! Great good", "Sigh, I absolutely LOVE this game. I hate myself for waiting so long to play it. I had a hard time accepting that remedy wasn't making this one but still..it's not a bad game at all. Now just hoping that I'll be able to play it on my Xbox one someday!!! Btw love the games soundtrack. I tend to leave my Xbox one just to have it playing. Great game awesome story love the max Payne series", "Red nunchuck, Japanese Import.Beautiful item, I use it with my Mario Wiimote. It is a slightly darker red but not noticeable.Works very well. Grandson enjoys boxing.", "Bought for kids but fun enough that I like playing it. This was surprisingly decent. For those who do not know, this is a sort of port of a free to play mobile game onto the 3DS. I say sort of port because quite a lot was changed. The biggest of which is the removal of all the micro-transactions and the nonsense that business model spawns. So things like timers, &#34;premium&#34; currency, and lottery machines are gone. That alone is a major improvement.However, on top of that they also added in a basic story line to the game. It isn't anything special, but it might be that little extra something to motivate you to continue with the game.As a bonus, there is a entirely separate second game included that is themed on the Mario universe. This one seems more basic though. The mechanics all seem easier to understand, and when you start up the game it recommends you start with this version if you're new to the Puzzle & Dragons gameplay. However, I've found that it ramps up in difficulty far more sharply than the regular game. Regardless, you can play either or and your progress is saved separately so there is no harm in trying either out.I'd say it's a good value. You get two games in one, and there are none of those awful micro-transaction shenanigans in it. The story is simplistic/boring, and it still retains its match-three gameplay you may have seen on your phone. It's a good time waster, best played in small doses at a time.", "Perfect I've been using this for about two weeks now.  I've struggled my whole life to learn chords, strum properly, and truly learn to play the guitar.  Finally this tool has helped me do just that.  Inside of two weeks I can progress between about 8 different chords, my fingers are calloused, and I can play parts to about 10 different songs (albeit small parts).  This is an amazing way to learn to play the guitar for those folks who are musically declined like myself. This doesn't actually work on my tv, you need special cables to play lagless", "Fits perfect Fits perfectly I was trying to install a better battery in my PlayStation 4 controller when I accidentally broke the little bag that holds the trigger in place. I was a little worried about these considering they are aftermarket triggers and not from Sony, but they are 1-1 quality. I think there's another review that says their noticeably a little cheaper or might be a little looser but that's just them being paranoid. These are exactly the same and now that I had the replacement in my controller for a few months I really can't remember which one broke. If you need a replacement I highly recommend these. Fixed broken PS4 remote in 5 minutes!  I have spares for when it happens again.", "My 16 year old loves this The case fits perfect around my wii u gamepad. I bought two and placed one around the black and the other around the white gamepad. It looks nice on both and I really like that the case is like hard plastic. Also, there are like little rubbery feet things on the bottom of the gamepad to help keep it from moving when placed down. It also fits on the charger still. All the hole cuttings align nicely as well. Overall, I am satisfied with my purchase. It really gave some color to the controller and protects it as well. It's everything I had hoped for and more! It's so cute My boys love Splatoon, so this was perfect for them. However, they have to keep removing it to recharge the game pad. Case is pretty rad, no damage and the colors are bright. it really looks good if you have a black wii u pad. I plan to order another for my husband since we both have our own wii u pad and love the game. it is a case and not a sticker and it doesnt make it heavy very light. It's amazing and centers the controls so you can have the best experience", "I honestly loved this headset, it has nice sound quality like the expensive headsets.I would've given it a five star rating if the wire was a little thick, because the way it is now, you feel as if you can just pull it apart with one tug. Other than that you will be satisfied.

It seems like the story is interesting but the controls specifically the jump mechanics kept me from enjoying this game by causing me to constantly have to repeat every single action involving a jump with any kind of  precision I haven't played DmC in a long time, but I thoroughly enjoyed the definitive edition. Graphics are way better and the gameplay is as fun as ever. great tracks! awesome fighting! dante epicness!! no imperfections here i love it", "recommended !!! excellent !! It's good It came in perfect condition!", "great Good product! I initially bought this for the grips. My hands, though not neccessarily large, get cramped while gaming for extended periods of time. This has been a huge help!!! Added bonus was the additionaly battery on it, though I haven't really noticed exactly the boost in battery life since I usually have it off or charging when not in use. Makes playing the vita a much easier experience and the additional battery is terrific. Really sturdy but light in your hands. Im very pleased.", "My 6 year old son loves this backpack. Great size with 3 different pockets & water bottle holder. Cheaply made.

This works perfectly in my Xbox Slim!", "Mac buyer beware! This product is for Power PC and does not work on just any Mac. I know the game is good because we used to play this years ago, but Power PC is not supported by newer Macs. This is the best greatest game i've ever met. I love it more than any kind of games on earth, even the StarCraft II. But regrettably, it's no longer supported by modern Mac, which the CPU is Intel. When I try to install it on my Mac, it says 'the PowerPC Apps are no longer supported.' It's bad for me. Does It mean that I have to play it on a virtual machine after?", "My husband and son was very satisfied Arrived on time, intact and as advertised. No complaints. The code doesn't work I want a refund or replace I prefer Ghosts.", "These are good but I got the CQC and those rock! I don't play many PS4 games but I felt I needed some additional cushion and surface area.Let me first note that I didn't realize how aggressive I am with my controller, so this review may be slightly biased.For starters, they will easily pop out if I'm pushing to hard at the edge, especially when playing with racing games. They got a lot of abuse during Rocket League. The more they popped out, the looser they got to the point I just stopped using them. This was very frustrating for them to pop out during an intense gaming session/scene/etc.The absolute worst part is that the little tabs that hold them, would catch on the DS4's own rubber pads. These things actually ruined my left stick's rubber padding. It created a gash and it just got worse every time it popped out. Unfortunately for me, I noticed too late. It's one thing not using something that cost me $13, but another thing ruining and having to buy a new controller that will cost over $50.I definitely like that it has a big and wide soft grip, but I wish it had a better way of locking them in.", "I was a little skeptical about buying these at first, then when they came, I put them in my controller and I can't explain how nice they are! Definitely recommend over those standard plastic analog sticks as these will take MUCH longer to wear down (If they ever decide to). Only thing I noticed when I first put them in the controller was when the shell was closed, the right analog stick didn't want to move. That was easily fixed by pushing a little harder down on them to seat them in the controller correctly, and everything was fine from there. If you're looking to replace old, worn-out analog sticks, these make excellent replacements! I love that when you first use them for the day, you can feel the cold aluminum. They are pretty awesome and look nice on my controller. I bought these thumbsticks to try and fix a slight drifting issue I had on my left thumbstick and it worked. These thumbsticks also feel much better than the old plastic ones. I was hesitant at first to get metal joysticks for a controller, since I was afraid that I'd lose the grip of the rubber stock sticks. I had nothing to worry about - Grip is still present with these metal sticks, and they both feel fantastic. I tried going back to the stock sticks after using these metal ones, and I just couldn't do it. My DualShock 4 (yes, these are fully compatible and feel MUCH better than the convex stock sticks) feels like it's built a hundred times better than when I first took it out of the package. It was really easy to replace the sticks, too, since I had a plastic separator too.If you have a DualShock 4 or an Xbox One controller, these are a must, as far as I'm concerned. No wear and tear to worry about, and the controller actually feels higher quality.", "Good third person shooter like GTA This is such an addicting game!

I use this game as a reference guide to identify various forms of life in our oceans with adolescents and younger adults who have not had the opportunity to explore the oceans themselves. Of course, one video game is not a substitute for the real thing such as going out an exploring the world underwater. But it does become an added teaching tool in the study of marine life using visualization, imagery, and hand eye coordination. Another game to enjoy that does not glorify murder and mayhem which has become so common in video games today. One of the reasons I like Nintendo games like Deep Ocean.

Got have Mic for zombies tho . both work perfect. Perfect", "Excellent These analog sticks work great for their price, however you may want to know a couple details before purchasing. 1) Adding Rubber Grips - (Short Answer)  Was not able to use rubber grips.   Starting with completing an easy installation I immediately put on rubber grips in attempt to decrease ware for the thumb sticks.  Then proceeded to jump into playing a game, immediately finding that the hollow centers of the analog sticks did not have a proper depth resulting in a massive amount of friction from the underside of the rubber grip against the controller.  I then tried to pull the thumb sticks a bit out only to find they went to the same position after clicking the thumb stick down multiple times and if I pulled the thumb sticks out to far there would be friction from another part of the inside of the controller rubbing against the spherical part of the analog stick.  End result, removing the rubber grips. 2) Play time and level of wear - (Short answer)  Will wear quick if you play a ton, but have no reason to believe they will if used casually.   I began using these twenty days prior to this post.  I cannot give a proper number estimate in which I have used these, being that It would cause mental anguish realizing the number of hours I have spent these past twenty days playing video games.  However, I can paint a quick picture.  I am a full time college student who is a massive introvert and on a summer break free of obligation.  Spending a day (7-9 hours) on video games feels like a blink and I more often than not plan on waking up the next day and starting again.  This level of milage took the rubber part of the thumb sticks straight off the plastic center stiff portion of the thumb sticks.  They still work, but the rubbery portions fold down when shifting/moving the weight of your thumbs to dictate the movements of your in game avatar.  In conclusion, these thumb sticks are great for their price, but may not be the best fit for you if you put in an excessive amount of hours in video games and want a thumb stick that will last a long time.

Madden just keeps getting better every year.", "It wasn't as immersive as I expected it to be if you like a pure car simulation game, then this is the game for you..you can spend hours trying to set your car with every details.at the same time if you're not familiar with car settings you can still use the default settings and have fun. graphics are amazing. from the detail of the car to every tracks.as far as the game modes, you can create a career from 0 (karts), and work your way up to the big league, with teams asking you to sign for their team as you progress in the game.I didnt give this game a 5 stars because it has some flaws (some pretty major). I feel the game was designed to be played with the wheel controller, but if you're like me that plays it with just the controller it might be a little frustrating if not impossible to play it right out of the box. the only solution to this problem is to google for the controller settings..you'll find plenty of options to choose from. just pick wherever works best for you..now with the proper controller settings i can really enjoy the game and have some fun..", "Very convenient, feels good in the hand.

I am willing to bet the people that say it is horrible power their miniamp through their usb on ps4. What they dont realize is the usb is also the mic through ps4. Yes with this setup the mic is horrible. However if you have common sense you will buy a mic cable to plug into the controller. This eliminates every mic problem people complain about. I myself have a standalone power supply and optical cable switch hooking this up to my ps4 xbox one and bluray player. Sound is fantastic mixed with Sennheiser G4ME ONE headset.  If you have mic problems, do as i said and it completely solves it. I purchased the pictured MixAmp Pro in 2014.  My previous setup was as follows: - Astro 5.8 Mixamp (First gen) - Sennheiser PC360's  I purchased this MixAmp because my Astro 5.8 receiver's battery has degraded to the point where it is necessary to supply the receiver unit with USB power or else it would turn off instantly.  I could have just purchased a replacement battery; however, the wireless nature of the 5.8 MixAmp was not really necessary for my setup.  Moreover, from reading around, the MixAmp Pro allowed me to: - Play a game on Xbox, and also be able to pipe in music from my computer on top of the game sound/voice - I'm all about playing COD or Halo to some drum n' bass or breaks.  Unfortunately, when I received the MixAmp Pro, I was unable to resolve the &#34;robotic/muffled voice&#34; issue that so many people are pissed off about here.  So the MixAmp Pro sat in a box and over the past year, and for about 10 months, I slowly attempted to resolve the issue.  I tried everything from replacing the supplied USB cord (multiple times), replacing my 3.5mm/2.5mm cables, powering from a wall USB charger, running game audio through a Wyred4Sound DAC into a Schitt Magni amp, etc.  I tried every conceivable wire configuration and was unable to solve the muffled/robotic voice issue.  The last possible thing was replacing my headset - which I wasn't too keen on.  I read in a drop discussion on MassDrop that the Sennheiser GAME ONE's (and GAME ZERO's (if you'd prefer a closed headset)) had been quietly refreshed by Sennheiser to include a removable audio cable.  My PC 360's had seen better days and had served me well for the years I've had them, and so I decided that I would go ahead and upgrade based on the Game One's being available on MassDrop for a discounted price as well as MassDrop confirming that the version they were selling was the latest revision (i.e. it had the removable cable).  The headphones arrived today and included the standard Y connector that my PC360's had (to split audio and mic).  The GameOnes also included a cable that lacked the Y-splitter/connector and went straight to a standard 3.5mm jack.  Using standard 3.5mm jack, I plugged everything in as follows:  - Optical from Xbox One to MixAmp Pro optical input. - USB from Xbox One to MixAmp Pro (for power) - Turtle Beach &#34;talkback&#34; cable from first-gen Xbox One Controller with Headset Adapter output into MixAmp (note that there is a newer version of the Xbox One Controller - I do not have one so YMMV if you do).  Talkback cable is available here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KC9J1Z4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 - Sennheiser GameOne cable straight into MixAmp - using the &#34;Headphone to 3.5mm&#34; cable, not the split cable with a Y adapter I had been using previously with my PC360's.  And everything works as it should - robot voice issue has been eliminated.  The MixAmp does what I was hoping for (computer/ipod audio on top of  console game and voice audio) and I can finally retire my 5.8 MixAmp.  So the issue was really my previous headphones (PC360's) terminating in a Y-split and then using an adapter to bring those back together before plugging into the MixAmp Pro - for some reason the MixAmp Pro didn't like that adapter (or any of the multiple variations of the adapter that I tried).  Astro should be performing better troubleshooting for their customers, or at the very least, test for potential issues with a variety of interconnects and then resolve those issues before selling a product for $200+.  Customers shouldn't have to buy a specific headset  - with a cable that terminates in a specific way - in order to be able to use the MixAmp Pro in the way it is marketed and intended to be used.  Astro annoyed the heck out of me with this, and I wasted quite a bit of money to do the testing that they should have done before the product was released; so I'm giving 3/5 stars.  Hopefully this helps someone out.", "Didnt work! product came in safe packaging and worked with the NO problems. love this game. brings back good memories witch now I can share with my kids", "It looks like brand NEW.

Also, there is a manufacturing defect in ALL of these where the power button is loose, causing it to rattle every time you move your head.First of all set up is a nightmare. The instruction manual (read cover to cover) is lacking any substantive information, and if you're on a PC a working mic set up is NOT included, you need to buy and install a separate bluetooth adapter in order to talk to people (somehow two way communication was an after thought when developing this gem). Secondly it has a lot of technical issues: the headset shuts down every ten minutes while gaming. I looked into it and it's a &#34;feature&#34; where the headset shuts down if it's not detecting any headset or mic sound...However this would happen mid sentence, mid game so it basically does what it wants.It serves as a hundred dollar pair of ear warmers, and that's about it. pc ps3 ps4 xbox phone all can use it", "great product Nice great", "Great and fun game im a sims fan The Sims is one of my favorite games and in the past I always enjoyed adding the pets into the mix.

Don't support scalpers!", "just what I needed thanks I just got it two days ago and its working perfect, hope it continues to work properly. it came right on time and the cable is very long!. This charger has some better reviews unlike the other products which is why I chose this. I use my phone charger to connect it to the wall so I can still play while it charges and not take up any USB ports from the wii u. Cable works great! Bought this whenever I realized splatoon required you to use the big chunky gamepad. I'd MUCH MUCH rather use the pro controller, but whatever. The cord is plenty long enough to stretch from my Wii U to my TV so I can charge it just fine. Which is good because the Wii U gamepad only seems to have about 2 hours of life. Works Great. Had no issues at all. Like the wii u charger that comes with the wii u except instead of a plug, It's a usb   EDIT 7/23/16 just came back to say this product still works after all this time.

The game was packaged pretty poorly, it was a little damage, but the game is good. great EXCELLENT", "I love the game, a little stuck in it right now. The open word is so vast and amazing as how much detail their is. I had been wanting it but wanted to wait until I could get a PS4 since I already had so many games on PS3 as it is. Game Stop heard my call lol, and had a deal where if you got a PS4 pre-owned, you got a free game for $30 or under.The game play is much different that I'm use to and did take some time to figure it out. But all in all I love the game, the story, it's really awesome. I am around 10 hours into the game and like it so far. If you are reading this then I imagine you know where to find more professional video game reviewers so I will keep it short. If you liked Origins, you will probably like this. Awesome narrative, great mechanics. Many ways to play!", "Works very well. It works. It doesn't work well with programs, and requires you to install weird software in weird ways (my computer, at first, wouldn't take the driver, and I had to disable the security). My UDraw tablet barely did more than connect, with the gamepad going all over the place, and compatibility software couldn't detect it. Worked twice, then died. What a scam. Worth the price.", "Spent a few days playing and had a great experience and then we logged back in to find that the progress has not saved the quest progression but had saved the level progression so no bosses/spawning areas/doors respawed, so we are stuck at a level with no way to progress. This is a common bug for many different levels so beware before you waste your time. The only suggestion for fixing this bug is to RESTART.Such a waste of time and very frustrating. boring", "Fun Love the game", "So first impressions, guess I will start there. You open the box and inside is a very nice controller case. Open that and you have a controller slot with some nice foam to keep your controller safe on the lid portion are two mesh pockets with a Velcro portion to keep everything tidy very nice case. The braided cable is of good length, and plugs in nice and easy. The controller is plug and play into pc which is what I am using it for. So first issue the backlit button are cheap crap. The buttons don't cover the whole slot so the light just shines straight out. Yes, it has a function to turn them off, but in messing with this option I came across problem 2. Access option to turn backlight off then go turn off rumble since I don't like rumble pressing the button to switch turns the backlight back on. So after messing around with it a bit, gave up on having both backlight and rumble turned off. Moved on trying to play the game I wanted it for Tera. This is a game I play with a controller that has to compete with people who use keyboards and mouse. So I was trying to keep playing with a controller, so for instance if I have block mapped to right mouse button and click the character will block as fast as I can click. The problem with controller is that they have that depress time was hoping this razer wouldn't. It has less depress than my xbox one controller, but the button are not very quick to respond so despite spamming B to block I block once every 2 seconds. This Is not very conducive at all considering especially in PvP I have to unblock rotate my character and re-block to block an attack coming from a different direction rapidly. So that's pretty much a right off for me but I'll continue. The thumb-sticks are very slow as well I play with max sensitivity on this game and it felt like I had cut my sensitivity in half. So again in PvP well changing camera angles and character direction needs to be rapid, I don't need a controller that lets people run circles around me faster than I can turn. Now for this &#34;ergonomic&#34; design the part of the controller on the outside part of the bumpers pushes outward physically making it harder to push the bumpers. I normally can use the bumper and trigger with just one finger on xbox one/360 and PS4 controller but this one was making me fight it to do that do to its bad design, also made that extra set of bumper they put into the controller very difficult to get at. This controller feels cheap overall like some knockoff. So poor buttons, bad programming  in the panel, terrible thumb-sticks and horribly ergonomic design controller, that came in a very nice case with a nice cable. I will stick with my xbox one controller. Best gaming controller", "Game doesn't work. Stays on the loading screen and won't do anything. So mad! Good.", "So I might be biased because 1) it's the first Assassin's Creed game I played 2) it takes place in an era that is rarely covered in video games 3) I'm American and appreciate the Revolutionary War atmosphere of this game.  The loading screens are long and frequent, but if you are a fan of any of the other games, then this one should be no different.  Granted the main character is annoying, but the story is overall appreciable.  The new features like hunting and ship combat are great. ok", "functional Nice, long cord!", "this is a pretty great mic although this is my first mic its a good one to start with. its cheap has good quality  .and looks pretty sweet. it took me a while to get it set up but charges quick. and it feels awesome on your ear i would defently recommend this to starting gamers Overall really  good. Fit well and sturdy, good sound Its amazing, i love it", "it is fake :( I got the game earlier than what I expected but it didn't come with the wireless adapter! Still good!", "This thing is awesome. Very quick to charge 2 battery packs. Charge lasts for a long time too. No more AAs or dead batteries for this gamer :) The charger doesn't work I should have read the other one star reviews as my battery arrived doa as well :(", "This is a Wii Classic Controller made to look like a GameCube controller. It plugs into a Wii Remote and can be used with both the Wii and Wii U on the menu and in games (assuming the game in question is compatible). Naturally, the designs are designed around Smash Bros. characters, and this controller definitely feels right in that game, as it has since Melee.The build quality is top-notch, but if you've ever bought a HORI controller, that's kind of old news to you. The plastic on the controller is matte finished, rather than the glossy finish of real GameCube controllers. It makes the controller feel slightly different than a real GC controller, but it still feels great. The ZL and ZR buttons are actual buttons, not triggers like the L and R buttons were on the GameCube, which could be a bit of a downer for some. That said, an L button was added to even out the controller.The controller has a turbo function, but I've never really gotten into using turbo for games. The sticks are tight and pleasant to use, with little resistance. They, as with the plastic on the controller, are a different material, but still feel good. The buttons go down easily and seem to use a mechanism identical to the old GC pads - so it's not likely to stick. Finally, the D-pad blows the real GameCube's D-pad out of the water. It's much larger than a GameCube D-pad and feels an awful lot like the D-pad you can find on the Wii U GamePad, but smoother. Since the GamePad has one of my favorite D-pads, this is a very good thing.It is more versatile than the Wii U Pro Controller at half the price - as a Classic Controller, not only can it be used with compatible Wii U games, it can also play games through the Wii Menu and can be used with actual original Wii hardware without extra setup - I've used this controller for playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl and it feels just as great as it does in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.Overall, there's nothing negative I can say about this controller. It exceeds expectations, it feels great, and it brings a familiar controller layout to a new generation of games. thank you This was a great Christmas gift for my sons, I got them each a different color. They are Mario Nintendo fanatics! This is perfect for the ones who love this series. It's very sturdy and works beautifully. I highly recommend these controllers for the Nintendo fan and collector!", "Aw shucks, dis here game unleashed the inner cow polk in me. I was rooting, tooting and shooting the bad guys to help my family and country. Then just when I thought I was done it started again, twice.

I WOULD NOT recommend it to anyone. Just buy a better quality product. Device overheats and the connected gamecube shuts off. We thought it was the gamecube for the longest...it's not. Its this adapter. We bought it for a gamecube that my son has that he lost the cables too, so when we got this and the gamecube kept shutting down, we thought it was the gamecube and went about replacing the whole system. Well, we now have two gamecubes and one power cord. Both gamecubes work on the other cord, but not this one. Boooo.", "Excellent 100% Great Product", "My son find this game a bit entertaining but difficult and somewhat boring too Single player is much more fun than the first game.  The AI seemed much better than the spawn-bots in the first game.  Beautiful world and look.  This is like a very simplified role playing game--just combat and weapon-upgrading fun all the time, which is what I want when I get home from traffic sometimes.  There is some replayability even as single player because you can play different characters with differing special abilities. This game is as far of a extend of being the god damn best thing thats happened in gaming history. The game is much of a modern style if anything very unique blending rpg elements to a free roam type of fps combinations. The game also features a very unique style in graphics. The formula in the game represents a new 24/7 fun factor. Best part is that the game is hella long. so the goty comes with a second disc that has about all dlc's (except for costumes) this makes the game very worth gettinf because the add on content is crazy... its a whole lot. Theres hundreds of thousands of different weapons (each has its own feel) some guns are weak others are better. theres a leveling system to where you actually do feel that you have leveled up theres also some bonus stats that can boost up specific things on your character like gun accuracy, melee damage, maximum health, etc. the game also has a somewhat perk system where you unlock these certain skills (well more of a skill tree) that gives a boosts to your character (these things are important and they all help you along as you gain experience points and level up, fighting tougher enemies. The games world is just gnarly, it really makes you feel thst your in there. The story is pretty decent you will somewhat lose track of the story due to side quests youll be doing here and there but its okay each main mission will remind you where you are at. All the characters are exciting and intresting even the enemies in the game. This game is truly a gift from god. Minor complaints are that there isnt a wholw lot to customize on the specific character you pick. There will be certain parts where the game gets tough but once you level up you will often change weapons you use since they will become weaker on stronger enemies youll face but every good gun in the game (that isnt a common weapon) feels right as you see your enemies takig alot of damage. honestly this is a good game and after playing one of the dlc's and finishong the games main mission there is still a whole lot to do (and im barely at level 33) if your lookig for a game that doesnt cost alot and is very long and fun you really need to get this quickly whether new or used.", "Best game ever! My boy loves it Awesome story mode game.", "really makes for a clean mount. I really like this Kinect Mount. This is an excellent mount for the Kinect, and we have found that it works much better when placed on top of the TV.  The bezel (the black trim that goes around the screen) of our TV is pretty narrow, and this still fits nicely without covering up the screen.  It fits snugly and securely, and I don't worry about it falling off the top of the TV (we have it mounted on the wall up a few feet so a fall from this height could be trouble).  The camera cover is a nice touch for the paranoid folks (like my wife) worrying about Kinect &#34;watching&#34; you all the time.  Of course, with all the &#34;Big Brother is watching&#34; updates to Windows 10, perhaps folks should be more wary about what is being broadcast with the Kinect. works great Does what it says", "They just don't make them like they used to.

I'm a casual-heavy gamer and I read a couple good and bad reviews, and I have to say the problems that some people were having with theirs didn't happen to me. As for those that have the little rubber pieces on the analog stick come peeling off, I highly recommend that you buy grips because my original black controller(which I kinda messed up the L3 button by pressing on it WAY too hard) rubber pieces never once showed ANY sign of peeling. I bought my grips from my local GameStop for about $2-$5 and they are pretty good for the quality. Would have given it 5 stars if it came with a charging cable.Oh and word of warning, this is a JPN PS4 Controller and NOT a US PS4 Controller", "Great idea but can't get it to work with an apple product. But it could be great with an android or an apple if it would work. When I finally got it working... love it.  Tactile response is perfect, no input lag, and decades old muscle memory came right back =)  It's the little things though that really make this so much fun.  The thing just looks dead on... that same weird shade of grey, the red, the size, the feel.  The box it came in looks like the old NES console which was awesome.  Even the paper the instructions are printed on is that weird off white that so many NES games came with.  Like the map for Startropics as an example; it was that same weird yellow / white color and feel.Not sure why I had so much trouble getting it to work.  This was my first bluetooth controller so I'll blame the difficulty on getting it working as my own fault.  Maybe my tips below will help. - Turn on your android device and go to Bluetooth Options; I find turning off the bluetooth radio helps. - With the controller off hold the START button until both lights light up then LET GO!  Don't keep holding it too long or it gets confused. - This turns on the controller in MODE 1 which works in John NES, Nostalgia.NES, and other emulators. - You should see the blue LED flashing once ever second.  If you were in MODE 2, 3, or 4 it would flash 2, 3, or 4 times rapidly then a brief pause. - The controller is now trying to pair with any listening device. - Turn on your device's bluetooth radio or hit the Search button if applicable. - Should see some weird 1e:03:34:f4 type address pretty quickly.  You can wait longer and it should say 8bitdo GamePad.  Tap the address / name and it should try to Pair.  It may ask for a key; just put in 0000 and hit OK. - Your device should soon say it's paired and your confirmation is that the blue LED on the controller is solid. - You may need to change your Default input for your android device. - Go to Settings &#62; Language & Input &#62; scroll down Keyboard & Input Device sections and tap on Default.Select 8bitdo GamePad.Example I'll use is Nostalgia.NES. - Open up NES emulator and tap the options in the upper right corner - Hit the Preferences button - Scroll to the bottom and tap Select Input Method - Select 8Bitdo GamePad by tapping it.  If it's not listed you've not paired it properly. - Now hit Edit Profile - Go through each option you want to change.  Example:  touch UP and then hit UP on your controller... Most of them are setup already but make sure START and SELECT are for sure; I think those weren't setup right by default.  I also bound Y to Turbo B and X to Turbo A.  So I'd tap on Turbo B and then hit Y on the controller.  Binding L1 and R1 to save and load can be helpful. - Once you've made your updates hit the back button on your device. - Load up a ROM and it should work perfectly!Troubleshooting: Q: My keyboard doesn't work!  I tap into a text field and no keyboard comes up!? A: Your gamepad is technically an input device and probably your default one.  Simply turn off the gamepad (Hold START until both LEDs flash then let go!) and then tap into the text field again; you will get your standard keyboard back. Q: I paired my device just fine a while back but I just tried it on and now my device can't connect to the gamepad. A: Out of batteries?  Ok yeah sorry ... of course it's not... Sometimes you can accidentally turn it on in a different mode.  For example I've had one of the buttons stick on me and then when I held START to turn on the device it wouldn't connect.  Took me a few minutes to notice that the blue LED was blinking twice rapidly then pausing.  That means it was turned on in MODE 2.  Turned it off, pushed all the buttons to unsticking it, and turned it on in MODE 1 and all was well.  Keep in mind you are pairing to the gamepad and the MODE; so if you turn it on in a MODE other than the one you originally paired it with then it won'twork. Q: I swear I did everything you said and it still doesn't work; thanks... newb. A: Yeah I had a heck of a time getting it all working at first.  I had to &#34;forget&#34; the paired device and re-pair it I don't know how many times.  I tried all modes, the 8bitdo APP, firmware upgrade, etc. etc.  I think the real ticket was going into the Language & Input then setting my default device to 8bitdo GamePad.  That's when programs like Nostalgia.NES John NES would actually show it as an option when selecting input device /controller in their preferences. Brought me back to my Super Mario Bros NES days! The controller works great, and I love have the stand attached to it.", "It arrived ahead of time, it seems to work well, it looks like its picture. My grandson loves it!

My 6-year-old son loves Mario, but got bored with this pretty quickly. It's also just 1 player. I didn't play it, I was just surprised that he wasn't interested in playing after a week. Easy and fun.", "Very good This headset has a great sound and is built very robust ....however it separates all the time from the dongle that is contained in it, and let me say if you forget to turn the TV volume down and you are using this headset ... when it separates ....the woman or GF doesn't like it very much at 3 o'clock on a working night. The headsets are epic! I love how I don't depend on cable, the surround sound is the best. I recommend this seller and these headsets. works really well! awesome battery life! pretty comfortable. nice looking. wish it could be a bit louder. also on some streaming apps (Hulu, Amazon), which spontaneously separates wireless audio -- not sure why. It's okay. But for an official playstation product I expected it to be much better. It cuts by chance, and the sound is not amazing. Have the microphone not yet used. The battery keeps pretty good. It's very large to wear.", "It contains the two best Kingdom Hearts games that can be played in beautiful hd again. KH2 especially still keeps amazing. Brand new perfect condition and it even came a day early. Highly satisfied. great! and better than ps2! its still missing the mouth talking sometimes as in ps2 but still great", "This game is great if you like RPG games and don't have any of the fallout games playing this game is worth every cent I'm thinking this is a little better than Skyrim and get Game of the Year Edition its pretty cheap and actually worth your money The game is in excellent condition, but it should be new, but not. Nothing better than a good fallout game Best game ever! I found this game in a vintage stick that just opened up near me. I got so far by a good thing from it and I'd say that's a great game! Graphics are great, game controls are fantastic and the story is pretty good. I have to warn everyone, although this is not a game for Wimps at heart. If you don't like violence and killing enemies you could play better candy crush or something. The game seems to reward you well and nice until now. It's really addictive and fun. I can play it for hours when four or five hours went by my favorite game.", "Normally I wouldn't bother rating Anythng 1 star, but Rockstar has this thing very difficult, if not impossible to authenticate. The automatic authenticity doesn't work and the offline setup doesn't either. The super secret code does not generate anything. They copy that in a window then enter into the other super secret code that comes on the back of a book, authenticate or whatever and it ends, say, you should make sure that the unlock request is entered correctly. Well, yes, you idiots, I know how to copy and paste. You can't even play offline and you have to start all over again. There's a Saferom link to go if you don't get it works. It also doesn't work. It's so sure you can't access it. I have the xbox version, so I can play it, but I prefer PC gaming. Maybe's the steam version is the way to go. I haven't tried it and I'm not planning to buy the damn thing a third time, but the walk to the PC.", "Was a gift and is loved and used by granddaughter. This game is amazing. You use the deck system as newly coded, but you don't have to use cards. Also a lot of new combos and spells. The best thing you get to play as a rickku as well and he is a monster in this game! The new travel ability you get is really cool as well. Very versatile for simple chains on enemies in battle and for escape, if necessary, love it all of you kingdom heart fans buy this will be worth the wait and money. The game will show you a new look and will also entertain you with new enemies and new companions with new support.to Great game, and I have it in good time.", "Nice... just like the oem one Works great... got a good deal on this. Cam fast. Very cool One of the coolest gamepads I've ever used Perfect Nice Controller ok Love the Controller Camo, none other than the Controller that comes with the console. So be careful with em'! My triggers start to get some wear on em' so I'm worried if I can break it on both sides it em'. Camo Controller, which doesn't like. Works well. The joysticks seem smoother than others I have. Maybe all in my head or I might be lucky, I think they could be made like this. My Controller works great. The info package tells me to let it rest every 30 minutes, but come on, really. Still works well after a few (like 2) hours of continuous play. Has not always hot or glitchy. Great Buy. Works great This Controller doesn't even have a year. I have the trigger with normal gameplay. Great product, thanks. I like it worked super.", "I didn't expect to play the local evil style of the game...If you play Heavy Rain, Telltale games like The Walking Dead & The Wolf among us style of the game, that's the game for you!! Played graphics and good story line. I really like the way that the creators of the game should change between the characters and lets you in tension right after an incident. Really solid game so far! Update: September 11 2015. Really good game. The only problem I have with this game should have been it much longer....It's too short. LOVE LOVE this game! I've already beaten once, but not enough of the characters survived, so now I'm playing through it again (this time with the help of a Walkthrough!) Although one of them could only have died last night, I assume because a decision I made earlier in the game.", "Amazing game with amazing story It froze on me and stopped working a refund This was the first game I played on the xbox one. I got away from the graphics and I like this Far Cry even better than FC3. Spectacular scenery and outdoor sounds that I just wanted to immerse. It follows a formula seen in other Far Cry games, but that's ok with me. This is some of the games the best AI for you to feel like you're really being chased by persecutors. This is Ubisoft, so there are many drug trips to Shangrila if you do the side missions. These scenes are spectacularly beautiful, but the gameplay there is so hectic you can hardly take it in. The only thing I didn't love was the end with the procedural boss fight. Voice Acting is Hollywood quality. Watch out for the freaky Rhinos-they don't give up once Riled. :) This game is very funny.", "A kickass special edition package for a great game. An excellent adventure in the Persona universe, and the extra merchandise is wonderful for every persona fan (soundtracks are above all a MUST for every Atlus game; Persona is no exception).", "I don't think it's a good time to do it like a week! It came, but I opened it today. It's not working and it's watching too. I know they will refund it, but it's another painful work. I think it's good! The price is good! Great mouse love it! Mouse is fantastic, but there were no instructions or something for this matter in the box and we had to look online to find out how to use it. No guarantee I think? Works well for our needs. With this mouse for more than a month and have no problems with it yet. The only complaint I have replaced this mouse the little logitech mouse that came with the keyboard. It works well for our needs.", "Although I like it, but seemed cheap when I put it in the mail. Good product couldn't get easier, I just plug it into my computer my computer automatically downloaded the drivers after this download my controller just didn't connect with any problem. If your game supports controller its work only some games does not support controller very conveniently a battery pack was broken, its not charging, but afterwards it's a very big element works great! Product is my second unit. They work well for charging Xbox Controller quality built In theory, this is a good product at a reasonable price. However, if we got the product it had problems charging... You would charge the controller on the station and it wouldn't be recognized if you didn't mess with it. I called Nyko's customer service countless times and there was only one answer. No answer, and no matter how many messages I left I got a callback. Also, the batteries started charging as soon as you hit the controller at the station. The charge never lasted long, but it was just a call response. No answer, and no matter how many messages I left a callback.", "I played the 360 version and enjoy the stern out of the row thr, but this only brought the game to the level that we always wanted to be it. Great game for those of you, the third person adventure. This game is satisfying and challenging, Give it a try This game was amazing! I have played the first one, and I must say that this game is a tremendous improvement in so many ways! The control and gameplay feel much more fluid, the sheer amount of weapons and objects is impressive, and there is so much variation that playback value was phenomenal! As vague as all this is when you have played the first and enjoyed, I recommend this. If you have played Dark Souls II and are curious, this improvement is worth it, I have friends who have played it and will agree that it is a great improvement and with the addition of all DLC, say that this is worth the price. If you are new to Dark Souls and want to jump here, I have friends who have played it and agree that it is a huge improvement, and with the addition of all DLC, saying that it is worth the enormous improvement, and that is worth the whole.", "I don't like happy at all happy only sad sad worked great for the first 2 weeks. Suddenly, a day of playing Zelda, breaks the joystick. It works ok, but the analog stick is not as loose as I like it in general.", "I enjoyed the game, but it was easy to beat. Everything was great", "Not working could not return It plays well", "much more comfortable and responsive than all the other controllers out there, even the original Nintendo GC Controller I destroy children with this controller, 5/5. Beautiful product This controller was used.The thumb pad was already worn away. And it didn't take long to be it, just easy, not responsive. Still works well, but not for fighting games where timing is everything works for Wii, Gamecube and WiiU. Very satisfied :) Great cheap controllers from Nintendo Works as provided. Longer string than original, which is highly appreciated Great product. I played with this controller for about a month and it is fantastic.", "My husband and I played this when we were younger on the Nintendo Cube. It's the same wonderful amazing game!! The interface is actually even easier to do then the original, which is always a perk. So glad Nintendo renewed this game :) Thanks I loved this game as a child and I still love it today! Super! Excellent game and the graphics are better than the original. This is the must game for the 3DS. It's still the best game of all times in my heart. Very impressed by the Sunday shipping! Great game Love the game The game that redefined history. I could write about it forever. But keep it short:- Amazing remastering of graphics- Impeccable 3D- Beautiful soundtrack (it made me the Ocarina as an instrument)- The best storyline of every video game everThe game has no mistake!", "It's a comparable model for the PS4 is $30 less. But there is no fully wireless competition at this price point, so I can't blame TB. Solid product. Sound: Great, Crystal clear audio. I play Evolve, and hear the monster rustling around now is much easier, I hear noises and environments I had no idea they were there.Mic: Quality is great, everyone can hear me with perfect clarity.Weight: These are light, not super light, but they can be comfortable on the head for 3-4 hours.Battery: No battery problems yet, but I haven't yet run. They calculate it over micro Usb.Design: They look cool!Proposals:You should come with a microphone stand, after two lousy experiences with Turtle Beach, I bit the ball and bought this. I'm just after how much better this unit works through the others.", "I have ALWAYS revered the AC franchise and will continue to support Ubisoft for a long time to come. Let's face it, there are a large number of Assassin's Creed games! My game shelf was about flowing, so I decided to clean things a little,therfore,I sold my & #34;AC3 - AC4&#34; games to buy this set. (I've never owned AC Liberation before) It's cheaper and more convenient than buying each game apart for the new buyers! I think the only thing I'm surprised were not included the expansion packs/DLC for each game. These are not new games (AC 4 could be an assumption) so I'm somewhat surprised that Ubisoft continues to pay players for these old expansion packs. Very fast delivery! The game is great! Love the fact that you can download and don't care about hard drive.", "If it worked, it would be great. I put it in and neither port works for both controllers. It lights up bright and the controllers don't charge at all. Just like this design... The extra color changes along with the ability to load 2 ECUs... Low-profile design... Aesthetic value I give 5 stars Great Shipped quickly works well, light isn't too bright, so it doesn't bother to buy happy Has this for about $8 with a discount code and I'm completely satisfied with this product. If you're looking for a cheap but effective charging station, don't look any further. The controllers slide into the place effortlessly, what's nice, and the gradually changing colors of the light bar are simply on the eyes. That is, the light can be pretty bright in a dark room that could be distracting for some people, but you can always turn it off if that's a problem. After purchasing, I assumed that the light bar changes to the eyes. That's the light can be pretty bright in a dark room, which it rolls almost a color.", "This is a great charging system for our controllers. I have a few cats who love chewing on USB/charging cable. We didn't want the disorder or risk of chewing cables by charging our controllers with USB cables. This dock works very well. The design is self-centering. The key is to place the controller in the cradle and let it rest perfectly the controller in the cradle. Then press on the top of the controller to activate as a single move, but you might not be able to compromise the flawless action that -and can be on your controller or charger. I think some of the bad reviews are by people trying to do this two-step method of don control in the cradle.", "Ordered this for my cousin it works, but not very good sensor would not have a complete scan of the room with the zoom attachment, although with more space than it said was the required minimum. Tryed several times without luck. good", "If you have problems, you either need to update the microphone or upgrade your xboxone controller. I use this on my PS4,XB1.360 and ps3 for two years and do not have a single problem, they are amazing. As someone who had turtle beaches, these are much better designed. It seems undisputed that the sound quality in the ASTRO A50 is top nodes for wireless gaming headsets. They are the most convenient headphones I've ever worn and often forget that I even sometimes. They block noise well and keep the sound of my games in.The primary problem I see people talking about the microphone, and I don't have any problems with my A50 (Gen1) OR the A50 Xbox One Edition without echo. I wonder if people have updated their firmware on their headphones or Mixamp since that was a big problem with the Gen1 headsets. (Even if it says the firmware is for A50, and doesn't always give the XBox One, it's the same firmware.)", "Delivered as pictured and on time I enjoyed the game, but it was too easy to beat. Great product good product. Fast delivery. This game is garbage. If I wanted Halo I would have bought Halo! ZERO game play improvement and it seems to me they just tried to create Halo.... Not a fan. The last Call of Duty something rooted in reality. Get Sucks dont Qaste ur money from MW 1.2 or 3 hell even Black Ops Cuz just the campaign a extinction makes the game worth I wanted a cheap game and I wanted my first call of duty game. I like the story mode and the game is packed action. would recommend anyone who loves realistic first-person shooter. Review of an 11-year-old boy: I couldn't stop playing this, it's one of the funniest games I've ever had. I win all Lego, Skylander, and similar games in short time, so my parents bought me as a challenge. Even after hitting it is still fun to play in this multi-player, it's hardly possible to play with a good game.", "great Awesome game!", "Love it and Smash Bros. Everything it was able to feel very good, but it was a good thing! I'm very good-looking woman. I'm very satisfied that it's expected that a 13 dollar toy, nothing too groundbreaking! Honestly Palutena is one of the numbers Nintendo should fix later when reprints come out specifically to the hand and overall facial structure. Nevertheless, this is still a nice figure to have if you are a fan of Kid Icarus or Palutena itself, as they're not much merchandise out for them. Looking for a good Amiibo figure for each Kid Icarus fan and Smash Bros. Exactly what I ordered and expected. We love the amiibos! the product came in perfect and fast perfect condition! I need to sell more for the regular price Is nice A good Amiibo figure for every Kid Icarus fan and Smash Bros.", "This game is awesome. Such a great adventure story. And buying the legendary edition with the add-ons was totally worth the extra quests and amount of gameplay. Recommend it to high. The ultimate RPG game. If you buy for a prewinter...that's it. Great Skyrim is beautiful and tough, it's ambitious and buggy, but that's why it's the best RPG to date and one of the best video games to date. Bethesda is not a novice in the RPG world and Skyrim is the fifth installation of an already very well developed video game franchise and virtual world. Tamrim is a huge country full of rich history, legends and adventures and Skyrim developed Tamriel even more than it is already. Skyrim game is easy to play, easy to learn and really fits well with individual styles of the game. Skyrim is a true open world game and one of my favourites in the genre (just surpassed by fallout: New Vegas game lessons are worth) to play that the game Skyrim itself as to play.", "Good price super I like it This applies to all Xbox One controllers: they work well and there is no load for the hand. The reason for 3 stars is the physical charging capability on the controllers. The cable and the port are very sensitive, which put only a small amount of load on the cable, while it loads it can ruin it in its entirety. If you feel like this won't be a problem, then go for it. You can put a lot of money on batteries due to everything that is placed in the controller. If this happens, you can go to Xbox and ask depending on whether it is still under warranty. I have this May 15th and was still under warranty for the exchange from August 30th. Best price anywhere! Fast delivery works awesome battery life was bad Boyfriend loves it worked fine, with every vibration, although exactly what I needed. Was trying to keep on buying a second controller because of the cost, but finally I gave in so I could play zombies with my BF. I would only buy Xbox brand controller.", "big 3 months from warranty aaaaand it crashed! Over $100 to fix", "This thing did NOT work. It's actually two pieces that - I suppose - should fit together and then fit into your controller with the batteries inside. We put the pieces together, yay. Stuck them into the controller, woot. But the thing was loose and almost fell out of the controller, no matter how many of us tried (hopefully exclude user errors). With this useless cover shaking around there, the batteries make no connection, making the cover completely useless. Don't make our mistake and waste money by being cheap :p I'm here now shopping for another.... Works fantastic! The controller was still dead. Works for about five seconds and then never again. Great price, and had no problems with the article! Works exactly like any other!", "must buy a monthly subscription to play this game. COMPLETE SCAM. Best game ever! It's so fun to play, and I love the Dr. Suess-like cartoon graphics. Basically kids friendly Call of Duty. NOTE: You need Xbox Live and Origin account. It's very nice.", "If you don't want to stop a PS4 really, you know that Blackbox will be pretty hot during long games. This stand with switchable dual fans helps to connect your PS4 at optimal performance temps. Plus it adds dual charging stations for controllers and adds two additional USB ports. While this element comes without instructions on the setup it is still very easy. Just know that this stand does not & #34;Lock In& #34; your PS4 and while it firmly supports it vertically will not prevent an accidental switchover if you don't have it on a fixed shelf.The dual fans make some noises, but not enough to distract you about background noise. As for the USB ports, automatically turn off the fans when it turns off power to the USB ports. I found this stand when everything is hot charge and a well done 3rd party fan for the stand itself.", "Excellent Very good console, I like it so much, The big drawbacks is that the machines thoesn't came with its charger If you know the old versions you will appreciate this system so much. It's so much faster than the previous model. Graphics are great. 3D is great when I use it. C Stick is pretty good for games like Smash Bros or Monster Hunter.Only Con is the game cartridge spot is somehow in an odd place. My fingers rest there when I hold the device, so I get a little worried about the game out of mistakes. They have exactly what they say they have. Thank you. My son loves it one of the best purchases I've made. Great product, but shipping with I-Parcel was a nightmare.

Me and my husband have a lot of fun! Great hack and slash with beautiful and polished graphics.It's cool to be able to take this journey down memory track and remember how One Piece started and now how much it's developed. would definitely recommend if you solve for some simple and fun games on the ps4.

No sore thumbs from regular controllers! After using the quay for a number of months I'd say it has been a powerful tool for the combat gamers looking to train in the next gen.The stock stick feels great and with the lower distance it takes to activate a direction moving even faster.

A lot of games I like are PS only.It was funny, but, Game Stop didn't whip the hard drive, so the ones I had TONS of downloaded games I could play.

Works well. hahha good let me tell you something, that's garbage compared to PS4 controller it doesn't even light like the ps4 controller and it's even worse that the 360 controller analog sticks are too tight, so good night luck on shooters, the scratch accuracy I need on my God Excellent! A bit too many buttons for a girl. But nevertheless, excellent! Overall, this is an excellent controller (even better now that they update the description on the page).

UPDATE: The problem with this battery doesn't hold a charge seems to do a lot with how you charge it. Just charging from the PS3 wasn't enough, it seems. Not sure whether it's a voltage or ampere problem, but definitely, here's how mine came to life again. I've been in a battery pack [[ASIN:B00QOEVMPS Tzumi Pocket Juice 2200 Mah USB Recharge]] so I'm not bound to the console.

With each release, Disney manages to stuff their game with so many things, and 3.0 continues to handle this with a mind-boggling amount of content. Long after many AAA hardcore games are completed, Disney Infinity will keep finding something new. Bringing Star Wars into their latest series was a no-brainer for Disney - and everyone predicted it would happen. I'm glad to say Disney went into the overdrive with this version as they have done the Star Wars license powerful justice. The game is spot on this time with fun quests and tons of side missions.

The graphics are really impressive given what they had to work with. I have this game today, so I'll update if something new comes up, but otherwise, the main part of the review will be right here.Gameplay: The gameplay is really great. There's really not much to say.

It was the best console ever. Sure to suck the graphics somehow, but it was always the story that fascinated me. I can honestly say that I regret selling it for the Bombshell of PlayStation 3. I've always played game like Star Wars Battlefront 2 or Jak 3 on them. Sony had to do a little more to the PS 3.

They weren't able to wonder only in large areas like Skyrim and Fallout.The graphics were good, but the challenges weren't so great. It was extremely easy to solve the puzzles. It seemed like this for a younger player or someone just to start. I wouldn't recommend this game to people looking for an open world experience or looking for a challenging game. I've played through it once and finished 85% of the game and it only lasted maybe 6 to 8 hours, I might have probably finished the game in 4 to 5 hours if I just played by and not looking for extra stuff. I won't play this game again, there are no extras in the game and if you have completed the first game, then there seems to be no reason to give it just a good 3, but I did once have the problem.", "What a mess of mistakes and bugs. In terms of graphics they are decent, but also walking causes the game to twitch and delay. It is a work only to get from one side of a city to another. Then in battle sometimes the game does not load the enemy animations, if you first so they just stand around as they are not sure what is going on. If you can look over all this, then you have the constant fear that the game will crash, and you will not get through a game without crashing it, you just have to hope that you will not lose a character and have to start over (this happened to me... Thanks Lion Head). For some positive the story is ok and the characters are enough to keep your attention.

This game has an unimaginable amount of DLC that I haven't decided yet whether it's worth it, but the base game is worth the discounted price. Uniquely fun. Game came fast and as ordered. Have no complaints about it. Game itself was s***, very repetitive and boring. Garbo game, just a game mode, confusing to a beginner and total lack of any story.

As a fan of the original on NES, that really brought me back! Quite exactly the same, except for being (obviously) much prettier and the ability to choose difficulty. Normal on this game corresponds to the challenge of the first. Had an explosion back to life this game. One thing of note- I thought my young nephew would love it because of the content, but he actually tired of it pretty fast. Partially because he never saw it, but also because he is accustomed to more advanced gameplay. The side scrolling platfomer just don't keep his attention.

My only problem with the thing is that after just an hour it really irritates the skin around my ears. That can only be that I put it on too tight I haven't really tested it too much yet.

Great second of these we bought and it took just over 30 days, it was so hot on itself that it melted the ground and blew the side. These are low quality and junk. From the packaging you can say these were made in China as there were several spelling and grammar errors. Better off just buy an actual Xbox power supply instead of this knock off. EDIT: We ended up with this broken a little longer while we were waiting for a new one to come in. It blew a capacitor inside and fried our 360. Buy this if you want to end up buying a new 360.

It also seems a lot more running around looking for things and fighting less with other characters than in the other Lego games (though you really should have to beat some pesky dinosaurs in times). I found it kind of confusing to figure out how to get to all parks, but that could only be me. My main complaint is the amount of bugs in this game that really should have been taken care of before it was released. It completely froze several times during the game.

Excellent video game, experience Maxime Ok, so I'm going and guessing here why some of the mainstream media sites gave the order average at bad reviews. Price. At $60, players today expect to be entertained for 200+hours, especially in the shooting genre. You need to multiplayer, new game plus bonuses, harder and harder troubles, etc... and this is probably just to barbones of a game for today's new generation of gamers.

Ask yourself what you expect from the series. For me the answer is: & #34;Six hours of fast-paced bang bang action and ridiculous set pieces in a semi-post-apocalyptic setting (or at least a really bad neighborhood, or airport), including helplessly always knocking down to the ground by a random explosion, followed by 20-1,000 multiplayer hours of getting caught if you're just paying on Mountain Dew.&#34.", "Download last fit days with the daily use of Xbox One Controller.

I defeated the entire elite four and the champion with just my level 52 groove with just one either and that's it. I don't recommend this game, it was a waste of money. I loved the Pokemon series because it was a challenge, now they are so easy that you could use your first Pokemon to take an entire gym or bow in the game. its pathetic. dot buy. great! gift for my grandson who said he loves it and played it when I wish him happy birthday.

Not your money. Drivers don't have to recognize it, but you can set it up manually, but other than that. Not Microsoft certified drivers just so you have to install to use it.

FIVE STARS FOR AMAZON ALSO. Terrible and cheap headphones... do yourself a favor save the $40 on better headphones. I have this and within an hour, boom, they don't work. I set everything as they should be, but it just won't be a sound through. Not worth your 40$ Husband loves to hear everything.", "The quality of the product is also very good. Excellent sound, good microphone. It will be a little uncomfortable after a few hours so I just re-adjust it and I'm good to go for another hour or so. For the price, it can't be beaten.

I also have a huge bead if you're curious - maybe that something has to do with it? Simply buy it already, you won't find better audio for the price. Absolutely a must if your gamer.

TLOU is an incredible story! Love this game!! This game is one of the immersive I've ever played. I was just involved in the story and presentation. Excellently beautiful. Gameplay ranges from tense to punish, It's almost like a zombie metal gear solid in that there are several ways and routes to pass a zone from stealth to weapons blaring. Compelling voice in the cutscenes is well done. Normal difficulty was difficult. Greater difficulty can definitely go crazy, I would absolutely recommend this game. Excellent. The quality is great.

What a terrible experience on my birthday! Look at the picture.At the beginning it was over 3 hours. We haven't been able to start the game that came with the console. Why?", "I have the game for over a week now and I have to say it's pretty awesome. The gameplay is a step over Awakening, the characters are great, and the story is amazing. This game requires a lot more strategy then Awakening did. I sometimes spend over an hour to do some chapters. Be warned that this is a Japanese game and you need a Japanese 3DS to play it. However, there are hacks that you can use to play it on non-Japanese 3DS such as Tubehack for example. I can definitely recommend this game and I can't wait for it to be released in America I'll buy it again. I've got this game as a gift, and I'm in love with it! The gameplay is very smooth, there are new fighting tactics, and the story is amazing. You can also change your hairstyle as much as you want once you unlock the My Castle feature.

Some are originals like MGS on PS1 (2 discs!) and MGS3 regularly and Subsistence (monkeys!). I was still forced to buy this because it's a series I introduced so much to HD (or near in most cases) in a compact 2-disc package and the price was right. Strange, it was missing & #34; Portable Ops&#34; which used the entire camera system in Peacewalker and MGSV. Anyway, for me it was worth playing Peacewalker with two analogs and the Ashley Wood Motion Comics with full voice.

Both sets sound great in play, but bad when they stream video or listen to music (except if they sound good to good-sounding mobile devices from Apple and Sony where they just sound amazing). Sony should add a firmware to the consoles do the sound processing instead of the headphones and have their design team test their durability before they are in production. Sound quality is okay, but not big (lacks low bass that I like), build quality a little fragile (can't see hinges or plastic frames long lasting), and has a lot of drop-outs (more than a limited random kicking in muting the tone for a fraction of a second, VERY annoying).", "It only worked by Microsoft and will be made with this product.

What I found best to maximize them was the cut off old original rubbers from the PS4 out (beware of doing this) and these guys on the now-available plastic joysticks.

It fits the PS4 perfectly, and was an accurate fit. The controller also go in and fit in perfectly. It's a light noise, but it's expected as it is a fan running. The blue light can distract, so you might want to put some electric tape over it when it's in your visibility. The fan comes on automatically when the PS4 is, and turns off with the PS4 when you're over the USB port on the PS4 power. You can also manually close the button on the front.

After doing, I feel like I could have worked with a heavier hand. The back of the unit comes without the black layer of what seems insulation and the front comes without the thin plastic frame you need when you fit the device as tight as possible. Both can be removed from the damaged unit with a small steam and a thin blade. The screen protection threw it was unnecessary; I spent a lot of time trying to use it without Airbubbles.

I'm glad that the original Disney game sets play on the 2.0 set, so if you spent the money for the first, no fear it will play on the new one. This game is really fun. It has a lot of playable content, and while Jessie and Buzz don't play very differently (more of different skins than totally different characters), the world is pretty damn awesome. So far it's my favorite of all Disney infinity pablesets (and that includes 2.0).", "Excellent for the xl size, it's the right size This bag fits to my 3DS XL, which also has a clear protective case on it perfectly. It also has three small pockets to carry three games with you the case is well made and hard enough to protect your system. I recommend this and for the low price you really can't go wrong.", "It came on time and was exactly what it was supposed to be, which was not quite new in the box, missing the loading chord and the controller was worn out so that your player sometimes goes forward by himself. Very nice machine", "Beautiful pens, work as they should Because these were so cheap, I thought they would be really bad and then probably not even fit into the 3DS. It turned out everything was great! I found my stylist and then lost it again before they came. So, if I do that again, I have more for the backup. I also enjoy a blue stylus as my favorite color is blue. These slightly expand and contract just as easy. I thought that was unnecessary, but turns out that I use the stylus more when it's longer. Love it what else can be said. :) They work for all ds family.", "I take really good care of my stuff, only this controller uses a handful of times. I put it in and it stopped working. Really disappointing to get bad quality items. It's a wired controller, so no more batteries, it needs some always use because its so easy.", "What a waste of money. My friend was so excited to get this gift, just to be disappointed if he couldn't get it to work even for a complete song without hard freezing his Xbox. No patches helped, nothing helped. Sat in our closet for a year before we threw it into the trash. I'm another 45-year-old man trying to get the little kid back by learning the guitar. I was never good, but that was because I tried to teach myself 30 years ago. This game (training aid) is really pretty good. The lessons are easy to follow, but hard to master. The song selection is really pretty decent... I actually bought several of the songs I hadn't heard before because they were so good... especially self trap from Playground Kings. I should put it on a star because it's a few bugs in the lessons and the guitarcade, but I won't because I don't have so much fun playing. I don't want to stop. I've got a few songs (they're not cheap) and the game is being expanded with 50 now.", "Super easy to set up, and works super broke after three weeks... This is a pretty decent cord to insert your XBox controller into your PC. It's hard to measure, robust and well done. It will serve as an excellent plug until the wireless version comes around the Christmas time.", "I bought this for my son as he likes to take his vita anywhere. So far it is a very good protective cover. He puts it in his backpack with various other articles, books, T-shirts etc.... He even has the suitcase from his nightstand with the vita in it and nothing happens to turn on the vita right, works perfectly. I would buy it again if you pay $200 for a device then you can just as well spend a few extra dollars to protect it.", "I give this product 1 star because I'm not able to use it. The strap does not stretch as it should (chest height). I know I have large thighs, but they are not huge too. So the part where you can hold on your thigh to the Nunchuk did not fit my thighs. I had to put it on my knee that would fit a small framed person athletic build. Quality and delivery were just not the right fit for someone who is not of athletic construction. As expected", "I have tried to get all & #34;tricks& #34; to run it, but without success. Too bad I can't give it back. Large charger. Gets the job done. Received with inner package opened and battery pack missing", "Great value for all the fun games you get. Great to play with friends and family. Fun also for viewers. Great, I love this game. A real workout. Hasn't played it, but it looks funny. My daughter likes it very much", "The only plus to have is the lithium battery, and the 9-foot cable. Other than that, each phone charging cable will do exactly the same service. I play with my cell phone charging device put into the controller. I noticed they have tried to patch this recently with the latest controller update. All you have to do to get around it is a set of batteries in the controller, dead or charged as long as it batteries in it should be turned on, and get its energy from the charger cable. Well, it's not charged when it's built in. Complete and total waste of money. Best quality. Useful product, but the controller should already come with it, even the wiI playing pad controller has a rechargable battery that I had for a year when it doesn't work half time.", "It's a great controller, especially for the price. Put it through its steps with Bayonetta 2, and it works much better than the Vanilla Wii U Gamepad (I just don't like that controller a lot). The construction quality is solid, and while keeping the sticks can appear a little stiff and the face buttons a little bit... & #34;pushy&#34; (not & #34;clicky&#34; enough?), while gameplay they actually all feel & work perfectly. The only downside is the fault of the Wii U itself, not the controller (you have to hold the gamepad; turn it off means the system off). Definitely recommended if you are looking for a good, normal controller for the Wii U and don't want to spend too much. It's definitely better than the gamepad in feel, and almost as beautiful as an Xbox 360 or PS4 Dual Shock Controller, period. We've bought as a, & #34; extra&# ustily worth the money.", "Just like advertised! works great, no problems. My Pikachu brings all the guys to the yard, dang right, my 3ds now holds a fee that works great for small DSs and Large... *Lala lala la my games be crazy* I use it again and again from day to day and it works perfectly. It was exactly what I needed. Does what it needed. I like that the cord was also a pretty decent length. Great product, but shipping with I-Parcel was a nightmare. Delivered on time without any obvious damage. Works perfectly. 'Nuff said. Good It's exactly what they said it is.i was very happy with the product, it loads my 3ds quickly and bought this as an additional 3ds charger. It was delivered to me quickly, and it keeps my gameboy charged.. What else does it have to do?", "Thanks! Works just like the original. The sensor bar came as ordered and it worked great!", "This should be easy to choose TWO players during payment. There is no option of TWO players who is very strange Awsome", "The Hitcher 3 is a good time to do the best games I've ever played. But first let's start with the big downside: buggy. The game is buggy, with some rare framerate issues, and as writing this review there's at least one search due to a strange bug (Skelige's Most Wanted), but luckily CD project Red is constantly releasing patches so soon the game will be perfect! Apart from that, but, I keep this game perfect. The fight is amazing, and extremely fun, and although it's pretty difficult to start out, and expansive that I've ever seen. This is my first game Witcher, and it's easy to get, although I recommend reading the books (I'm currently reading time from Contempt) game is one of the most beautiful, and expansive that I've ever seen.", "2nd EDIT: the side plastics are now under normal wear. Jesus.... these things are garbage. I still have to restore and headphones over 8x during over 4-6 hours of the game. If your multiplayer games it will confuse you. I don't check things often, but never bought somthing so & quot;Chinese&quot;EDIT: they have now constantly a problem. It's a problem once a week. Now it's all the time. You can play for 30min, then the sounds goes completely hay wire. Sounds very strange and my ears hurt. I had commented on it below. 2-3 times through 5 hours of playing. I'll never have sold anything of turtle beach back to them very strange names to maximize profits. Shame on them. You play on a game, complete and need to be repaired again, very often. 2-3 times through 5 hours of playing.", "If you remember to buy this game, please don't be stupid and waste your money and time Not like the previous battlefields. Not worth the money", "The PS3 never worked properly. I bought it while my son was on vacation and he was back after the warranty expired. He hates it and it was a waste of money. I bought PS3's before. I'm not sure if this was renovated, Moded or whatever, but it doesn't work properly, so I was out of over $300 for all the items I bought for this system. I'm now in the process of directly dealing with the original production company. It's a pain. it was a good purchase for how much it cost it's great. thank you.", "Fantastic game overall and less precision obstacles; when the &#34;Sonic Boom&#34; branding makes you afraid, don't let it. This is one of the best Sonic trips in the years.Sonic Boom is a GORGEOUS 2.5D entry in the series that draws its characters and settings from the Sonic Boom branch of the Sonic's Hedgehog franchise. That means it's a side scroller like classic games, but with 3D characters - think of something like Donkey Kong Country Returns when you haven't heard of the term &#34;2.5D&#34;. The title contains elements from a lot of quality Sonic gameplay.If you just play through the levels, like various Mario titles, team-based gameplay with unique powers like in the lost Vikings, expansive cards with hidden paths only accessible with specific skills a la Metroid - and network them all with quality Sonic gameplay.If you can simply play through the stages as you can enjoy one game with less of the great designs, the #fokit.", "Came in good condition. Purchased more than one of this seller and I am very happy with what I got. No problems. Simply the amiibo as soon as possible premium product, the falcon is excellent", "Keeps my son busy Everything good, as I said", "I didn't play it anymore Call of Duty. I have this game just a joke. I bought it Nintendo I did it. I don't play more Call of Duty. Game of the year 2015 if you ask me. Amazing game! I wanted this game with a one year old can be tough. This allows for beautiful short battles where I can jump and jump quickly. Much depth, but not your soul to play. I didn't want something violent that I feel comfortable with her staring at and she bops along with the music and she loves all the colors being splashed over. So if you're a gamer you shouldn't miss if you're a new parent you shouldn't miss out on this, and if you're a game and a new parent then stop sitting on the fence and buy it. PLEASE note that this game is not great, it has internet access. Although I did some reviews before buying and even talked to some game stores (10) was very disappointed.", "Absolutely loved. What the hell?", "I rated these four stars because every now and then it seems to be putting on and seem to have conflicts with certain add-ons. Difficult to install on Windows 10. No updates available to my knowledge. Program ends in the middle of the flight. Very annoying.", "SCAM! dont try NOT TREY THIS&#62;In so astonished that someone would try to benefit from it.All you have to do is make a new account if you don't have one, then buy a free subscription on the xbox Live website.Then, if you are enabled, you will be able to disable Auto Renuale.", "Better order online, then pick up a third party nunchuck from a gaming store - this product has just as well as all in-Boxed Wii/Wii U Standard Nunchuck I got, that is, impeccable. Highly recommended as the first station for replacing nunchucks, bar none. Great!!! I love that the white nunchuck was still available! Simply buy at Wiimote. Must, as some games require it.", "I have a habit of finding great games years after they have come out and everyone else it's over and this game is no exception. That said, I came to Arkham City backtracking from the disappointment that Arkham Orgins was and this game feels fresh and brand new even though it has been for years. Gameplay is hard without unforgivable and the story is really interesting. In serious considering buying DLC though that's a little expensive. This game is super glitchy. I had to restart twice if a mistake me in a situation I don't get out.", "This game is amazing has it cheaper than getting it in store :) the package came on time Thank you for really enjoying this game!

No problems works perfectly as described...But spelled ONLY for Super Smash Bros. Wii (In-Game) My boy loves it I just bought it in the hope that it's in value as soon as someone hacks the WII-U. There's no better way to play Smash Bros then with a GC controller.", "Terrible very nice freak Pac Man", "I love the 64GB, Lets me get the digital only games without worry about running out of space. Second card I quickly bought a lot of memory above expectations will love the business again It's one of the biggest drawbacks of Sony and its many mobile devices is that they often try to rely on their own proprietary media formats. This has almost ALWAYS failed for them and the PlayStation Vita memory card is no exception. Instead of using the widely accepted SD format, Sony created this card for the system. It's very difficult to find these cards at a reasonable price, even for a very small amount of memory (MicroSD cards can be very cheap with large amounts of memory). And the fact that the vita is practically useless without one is over frustrating. We can hope that eventually Sony will learn that their own media will force the throats of consumers and will use standard formats, but until then you will peel $80 for a 64GB card like this. 100% compatible, excellent envelope and almost 60 Gig.", "Not original controller, they work ok, but there's a clear difference between the controllers I bought from local stores and these controllers. The case could be original Sony, but the rest of it is knocking garbage. I have this for about six months and I need to press the PS3 button, then the X button then the triangle button to connect it. You also switch off when you go away for more than five minutes. You work, but not at all, as described or what I expected. You get what you paid and I didn't pay much so I have...

Works just like the official PS3 controller. The feeling is similar, the buttons are really good and it keeps the fee for very long. Best controller you can buy for your PS3. Very satisfied customer. the controller is great! I had a little trouble with it at first, but it is perfect now. thanks to xx", "It's no problem that MOGA is not up to date with programs that can use this controller. Since Lollipop came for Android, almost no applications work with this controller (Grand Theft Auto is a big one). The only exception is that most of the emulators (apps to play nintendo games, etc.) will still work with this controller.The controller itself is okay; I wish it had more keys, but I knew what I got. I also like the form factor as it is quite small. This product runs on two AAAs, and will last a long time. Once again, the main problems with this controller are software-based games, and I would not recommend you buy until these problems are addressed. This device does not work with the Nexus 4 if they have the Android version 5.1.1, and if they only consult the customer to something useful, games like dead triggers, NOVA, and other unobtrusive games.", "Great!

The only problem I have is that I could play Street Fighter V when it comes out. For now I'll play 3rd Strike and Darkstalker on PSN.Fill me if you like: KidFlash613 Overall large controller...

The shipping part took forever I thought they lost my order !!", "So much fun and so addictive I can not stop playing it. A really nice WRPG style 3DS game.One of the very few on the 3DS. If you play games like Skyrim I highly recommend this game for your 3DS. This is my new favorite game! I love games that you explore and interact with the environment, collect elements, and build a character. This game fulfills all this and much more! You can live the life you want to lead (your job, basically), gain experience, collect elements, and fulfill small quests. If you are tired of it, you can choose a whole new life for your character and start again while you have all the skills you learned with your last life! BUT, you need to gain more experience or try new life, the way you interact with the game changes, so you can do new things and go to new places.I only gave it 4 stars because the actual story line of the game is incredibly lame and boring. BUT, you don't have to do it a lot and before everything you want to do.", "Good Excellent recommend 100% I don't like that you can't use them on the first system. We have these for our children as a Christmas gift and we have had hours of family fun playing and fighting with each other and against each other. The characters are made of the same plastic as the first and when you step on certain, they will break, but they are quite robust compared to this.

Product as described.", "The best game ever !!! EA 360!! must buy terrible game, I expected all the new features I saw and nothing for my money. This is an EA Microsoft trick to get people to spend money on a new game console. Do you want to buy all these cool features, you have to go buy a new xbox1. Trash, plus they put the new scouting points accumulation system without the new scouting system, 380 points max for a season and I can never get it over 500, can't even see an overall score. This is a scary game and a big mistake in my book for EA. Way to push the new gaming systems for Sony and Microsoft. U guys must stop hating Maddean I've all of them a great game the same as last year. Same cut scenes. Same comment. Same animations. What have they added?", "I have made this controller for my new phone. Learned, it has no support for Lollipop OS and was essentially an expensive brick, not that the company would mention that. 1/10, wouldn't buy again. This is a great device. Works perfectly for Android!! Makes all my compatible games so much more fun and a lot of console as depending on the quality of the game. A must for each 1st person shooter or driving game. Should have bought a long time ago. It would be five stars if there were more games for them. It pays off. Ordered for my husband for his phone. He has a lot of games on his phone that he loves to play it and I thought this would be better than using his mobile keyboard. HE LOVES IT! Great quality will save you headaches. While the physical controller himself feels beautiful and its robust, the software and setup is a nightmare.

I'm so satisfied as cheap this element was, and it came on time and not damaged at all! Wow, what can I say this was such a big purchase. I use it as a cable box since I have Verizon Fios and all channels come in clear. I've played a few games and it's very fun. Just on the back I'd say that 500GB is too small and fills up quickly. Sometimes it just doesn't work and you try everything and restart it several times.

Oh, and far too much Jar Binks...If you don't want to read the full review here's the summary: 1) You can't play the game sets on line; 2) If you're playing split screen, players 2 don't earn in-game currency, I'll still find no explanation on Disney's site that's understandable, and won't be their number for when they play solo again; 3) The system of sharing numbers (i.e., playing between the members of the family to play, is able to play the music.", "I've never played Disney Infinity 1.0 or 2.0 so I did this on my experience with 3.0 so far. First out, the base is well done and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can enjoy the difficulty of the game so that kids and adults can. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect as you can do pretty much everything you can do. If you're a Disney Infinity game already then I suggest not on 3.0 until you have a next generation console. This game is getting pretty big and if you want to build bigger worlds and enjoy smoother gameplay then when you get a next generation console. This upcoming black Friday would be a great time as this game would probably fall a lot and so be consoles. Purchased the starter pack for the PS3 from a local dealer today, but had to return immediately. It seemed a software glitch when the base was recognized again when it was in the console; you could only play with the volume that comes back.", "Great case! It fits perfectly to my older model 3DS XL. It holds 8 game cartridges and has a loop for an extra style. I wouldn't bother going to Gamestop or Walmart/Target. They only sell the Nintendo brand or random cases that are huge. I'm so happy when I get the case, it's so beautiful! I don't know how to describe it, but I think if you buy it for DS, you'll know how good it is. You DS need to have a case to save it so! perfect fit. comfortable handle. very happy with this product This is a good product for the value. Has a great job to protect the 3ds. I've got the new 3DS and it just fits well.", "I've always used the standard headset that came with all my systems I've bought, so when I got this reasonable price headset, I've been blown away from the sound that comes from these badboys! outstanding bass and highs and voice monitoring is what sealed the deal. This is a must for an entry-level headset if you don't want to spend too much, but want top quality. This is the headset to buy. Hooks to controllers. No other cables. Independent controls for in-game talk, microphone volume and sound from your game.Very important, these have a &#34;monitor&#34; feature so you can hear yourself talking about the headset.After you have through 5 or 6 of the cheap Microsoft single-ear headset/mic devices that have fragile internal cables and break after about a month, I switched to these.

And, I have to say that if it was FF, it would be the best ever. And, since it's not, I think that kind of makes it better than all of them.

Suspect this product sat on the shelf for a long time. Very disappointed. The cheapest way to get a real Microsoft battery. This is important because most of the aftermarket batteries are junk.

I have quite a lot of B for everything since it has a universal setting and I had no problems. A mode is a proprietary mode that is made to work with certain games, but I feel like they don't keep up as there were problems for me in Android Lollipop. Battery takes a long time - days - if you don't load your phone with it (the phone charging is a great feature by the way. I love the way this controller feels.

Camera just takes their movements well. Is it exactly... no, but is that they no longer need to hold a controller while dancing, this doesn't make such a big deal. Our great complaint with this camera in general, the cable that you need to connect to the playstation is super short. When my husband went to buy another identical to make it longer, they just told him the manufacturer makes it and it would have to be ordered by them online.

If you're an Xbox One I would definitely get this to go with it. Excellent Excellent All Perfect Thanks The Kinect in general is pretty fun. It definitely needs some work, especially if you're a great guy like me, but it's a lot of fun to play with the family. I would highly recommend a holder for it and placing it over your TV. That seems to help things a lot. As far as Dance Central Spotlight, you could really do without this game. It's easy to see why it comes with the Kinect for free as it usually comes with a money grab game. It comes with 8 songs, and you have to download any other song you want to get $1,99 a piece. The game doesn't really play well with the Kinect either, you spend a lot of time trying to recognize it and your movements.", "Great game as usual. We order this game every year. If you are a fan of Madden, you will be happy with this game. I recommend the deluxe edition to get your ultimate team started. Madden ever year. Definitely feels like another animal then behind Maddens. I can see the aggressive catch in head 2 head abused, and there are a few glitches that need to be looked after, but otherwise it would be a great game. Great concept to add the fishing opportunities feels like an improved experience. Much better than Madden 15, especially because EA added the draft champions and the songs that play when you are on the menu. The only drawback would be the comment during the games, but it should not be taken away from the actual game experience. Great work of EA worth when Madden. It is Madden. What do you expect?

I have to say this is my least favorite NFS game so far. The game looks good on PS4, the advantages of new hardware and the production of the best graphics in an NFS game yet. However, after just a few minutes of the game I've noticed that malfunctions where textures wouldn't load or my car would sink into the ground. That's disappointing when you consider that this has been developed by one of the richest successful companies in the world. EA can and should do better. The gameplay is pretty bland. You can play as a cop or a racer, and both offer three activities each. The lack of modes makes rivals get stale fast.As you earn speed points then use to buy new cars, upgrades, weapons, etc. As a cop there is no risk of losing these points, but as a racer you have destroyed idea.", "If your Astro A50s have microphone problems this is the solution!

Just tried my normal earphones and they also work! worked well for three months, but now the left side stereo sound cuts again and again. Microsoft quality really has a nose dive. The Xbox One itself seems to be unfinished... It has less audio controls than the 360, which is why I needed this first and foremost. Very few Xbox One users compared to 360 users are able to use microphones in-game because this problem is its OK perfect! It was somehow annoying to buy these separately to be able to use my headset with my older XBox One controller, but the functionality is worth it again when it works to isolate it from the voice but do it do it.", "Ugh omg, I love this series can describe more than words, and this game was a perfect end.

I imagine that I have hours of fun from this! I've never played Disney Infinity 1.0 or 2.0 so that I put this on my experience with 3.0 so far. First of all, the base is well done and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can enjoy the difficulty of the game so that kids and adults can. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the design aspect as you can use your 2.0 base and only buy the 3.0 game, but don't quote me on it.

Quality was just like the OEM cable. VERY durable vigilance. Features perfect. Beautiful 480p output from my Wii to my HDTV. Works GREAT! Now our Wi in color! Expected high def capability with these, but experienced terrible blackout problems (while playing screen would be black for 1 to 2 seconds every twenty seconds or so). Seems to be a common problem that I solved by lowering the settings from 720p to 720i. Cables are good quality and quickly arrived, just wished the results had met my expectations.

Masahiro Sakurai thanks. In my head this game saved the wii u for me. Although the sale of the console are still weak this game made the console worth the price in my head. Please if you own a wii u you must own this classic. My Wii U worked flawlessly until I bought this game. Once the update is downloaded and installed, I have a gamepad error code 165-6596. Googled and found many other encounters with the same exact problem as the result of this game. Called Nintendo and they try to tell me my gamepad is broken and they want to fix it $99.

This game is much better than Disney Infinity. Graphics is solid, and it has a good storyline. Product as described. so entertaining, 4 and 6 years old love it. don't have to worry about violence, and this is a brain stimulating game in my opinion as children constantly solve puzzles and think outside the box. I recommend it.", "I bought the Polka Dot Case. It is really cute without being above the top and makes it easier to find the case under all the black accessories I own. I use it with the new 3DS XL and it fits well. The hardcover case is appreciated because it allows the case to hold its shape and has a better feel handle. The size is also good. The arrangement is efficient enough that it only needs a zipper. If you want an idea, it is stacked over the size of two 3DS on each other. I can't talk about how it holds the wall charger, but I use a USB cable charger and it fits in just fine. Just as described. Perfect for transporting eight games and two DS consoles safely. Thanks!

The iLlumiShield Nintendo 2DS Screen Protector does a wonderful job protecting my son's 2DS. It protects the screen from scratches, dirt and dirty fingers.

AWESOME!!! cool game", "It's incredible to do this to do this. It's incredible to do this, and there are so many facets and different ways to play it will keep you engaged for hours. The main story line is brilliant and your side jobs, or co-op missions are excellent. They have heist missions, murder mysteries, and Nostradamus symbols to unlock. They develop assassin skills through creeds in this game, and your level of assassins will only be maintained by accumulating points through the game. In any case, recommend this game, and the Dead Kings option as a supplement to the game. It opens up a whole new story for Arno (main character) to play. I'm conflicting about how to rate this area-it's a spectacular work of interactive digital art that we shouldn't take for granted, but I'm giving 4 stars because the formula wears thin versions.", "The person who received this gift loves it and is glad that I ordered this (Master Chief Collection) over the call of duty special edition. takes a long time for the games to download.

Three days and five separate phone calls with xbox later (to try and solve the problem) the last guy I talked to at exactly the same price, except that you worked immediately. As far as this actual product, I enjoy it so far, but I'm skeptical about game systems from here. Fun and done. Love this about our Xbox 360, and glad to have finally updated through large parts.

Package came this week Monday August 24th, and today Thursday August 27th as this review to write the blue that I used the most is already failed!?! The sticks especially when used in combination in fast first person shooter games (COD Ghosts), fails, glue or rather stops, so suddenly my rifle doesn't react as expected. So after three days - WOW! So either Sony, which I already believe is busy producing most of the retards of each company TOTAL crap, or this is a fake controller. I called Amazon and reported the problem. They send me a replacement today, and introduced a feedback for this one, and will check whether it's real after the return! Until the replacement controller comes, I can't play with my son Split screen so disappointing!", "The first really wireless headset I've seen, the PDP AG7 is comfortable - even with my big head. All the other Xbox One headsets I've tested have a wire for chat that runs from the headphones to your controller. Not the PDP AG7. The key is in the clever USB transmitter that plugs into the Xbox. It automatically connects so you don't have to fight with these unpleasant BlueTooth connection processes. A feature I especially love are the separate dials for chat and total game volume. I can now hear when enemies are behind, left or right - or above me in games like Titanfall. LOVE the sound. The same with the game volume. The entire noise during the game is amazing.", "Kids love it! I have to admit that the LEGO movie was amusing, and it was fun to see some of the elements and humor that were brought into play. The thing is, while there is more of an adventure mode to this game, it still seems a repeat of any other LEGO game that preceded it. There are also some gameplay elements that are not quite intuitive. It's nothing we really get out of the way to play here in Casa Rudy, but it's also not a terrible game. A good one to get a discount.", "Very good. I loved. Lives up to expectations. I bought this as a gift for my bf. He loved it. However, the light on the statue did not work. We tried different batteries and nothing yet. Ruined my gift for him on his day. Now I am back for a refund. Disappointed with Warner brothers. Please do your quality control right.

Not sure why it doesn't extend the full length of the venting; about 2 inches short. My only guess is to allow for better venting at first turning the XBOX after high usage. SUPER simple installation. Heat measurement, and pretty quiet. You can listen to it, but it's not overly distracting. Definitely worth the money so far. This intercooler does what it says.... now with this intercooler the air in the same area with just the front and opening before my intercooler I use a digital tempmeter to see how hot the area where I was my Xbox always and it was reached temps from 92 to 95 degrees.... now with this intercooler the air in the same area is hitting 83 to 88 degrees and blows out all warm air.", "After two months it died!

The delay on this thing was so bad, it was more a handicap than help.That's not the case here, it's really 1-to-1. It feels like I'm playing on a multi-thousand dollar gaming PC. I'm so much better at FPS games it's like another person playing. I'm playing on my PS4 with a Logitech G700 mouse and a Sony navigation controller, from the couch with a small laptop.

Add value to your collection when you're the series. if you're a gt fan don't hesitate! they're still adding cars, tracks, races, online groups and races...the physics is always also updated..Car manufacturers design prototypes and submit them! its out of the hook! the wheel sets have never worked better, and always get better. its so realistic my own car feels like it's doing in the game!! Pretty cool, I'm still working on it, barely scratched the surface! Great game love this game This game is one of the most extensive racing games out there, but the physics of the game is outdated.

It also has errors that can sometimes be really exciting. First, let me try to explain why I think this is a good game. I think the first thing I noticed when I put the disk in and loaded the graphics. They are really representative of the ps4 potential. The graphics are top notch. The cars all look beautiful, the weather, the sun and light effects are all realistic. You can change the time of the day in most races and when u happens to drive as the sun goes down... Well, you're gona have a bad time because the sun will be dazzling. But at the same time, that's pretty awfully impressive. Another thing that this game goes on for it is the simplified/ripe approach to racing. No stupid story here.

There are 12 bags for 12 games (3DS or NDS), which is quite a lot, considering I usually only carry around 6 with me, but now that I have the ability to carry twice as much, I'm sure to use it as the time goes on and new games are released.

There is a wrong way to load the remote controls on the station where they do not, but it is a really easy shift of the remote control. One of the USB adapters did not work at first. E-mailed nyko, got next day and replacement within a few days. Great customer service just don't lose the little things and youll love it excellent for the players to keep happy and recharge and an excellent price too!

If you get a PS4, then this must be one of your first games, especially since you can get this for ~$15. Excellent arrived safe timing. Although some times the matchmaking takes a bit too long.

This controller is awesome and it's my most important now. The finish is a tad Shinier as the picture shows, but it's still a matte coloring. It comes with batteries and the last over a week solid game. I recommend picking up a charging kit and then you will be set. Perfect. Love the pattern on the controller.

I googled and the only you tube clips I could find were reviews of the product that said it was good, but hard to assemble. I gave it after about 5 minutes. Life is too short. Outrageous, something in several parts without even sending a very basic diagram to help with the assembly. Wishing I would read the other reviews before ordering. Life is too short.

For me this is THE BEST of Vita 2000 cases after trying different options. For my big hands it works nicely making playing the vita as comfortable as with a playstation controller. There are some drawbacks, volume down button is hard to reach on the fly, and the locking mechanism takes a second to secure, but given the benefits that quickly moot imo. It's really super comfortable. Arrived on time and is made of a very durable plastic. My only problem is, however, that it doesn't quite fit as I want it. The depth and length of the case is a little loose, which means it's shaking around. Even from top to bottom the case almost seems to crush the vita.

Just wish it would have bigger HD!!!!!", "Too tight fell apart and microphone broke These are great for the price sound is solid eating upholstery is convenient big purchase Good item mine broken...the wire ripped out of the headset...had it under a year...wanted to say about 5or6 months...how disappointed...but they were pretty good...so I think I'm going to buy them again...smh...wish they could have lasted a little longer, although Good Bought the Black ops 2 Edition of this, took two months, then it fell apart.

Easy to make changes and carry around, I made some changes and it came out nicely.", "I'm a fan of AC and I've played every game up to 100% completed (or close to it). That's until I get Unity. How many AC fanboys, I've made this game out of sheer loyalty to the series, and the only thing I feel good about it is that I don't pay the full price for it. Even getting it at $20 is still a lot, because then you have the problem of slogging through this beast of a game. First, this game is massive, and not in a good way. Strangely enough, the campaign is the shortest of the AC games, and exactly how forgotten. What's amazing is the crazy amount of page quests you have to play around. That would be cool if they all have fun, but a lot of them are like just going, although the movement is playing game. It's 30 #34; companion missions&#34; where all you do is a way to run and then try some random guys. So much fun.", "After receiving two defective from another vendor, this works well. I can only compare this with the Microsoft xbox360 wheel and this makes that seem like a toy. Force feedback is strong when using project cars on the ps4. I also used this with Drive Club on PS4 and Gran Tourismo on PS3, but the FFB is not close as strong with these games.Only complaint-the FFB weakens when the wheel gets hot (known edition), which is noticeable during longer races. Once it cools down, the strength comes back. Overall, very happy with the wheel. Big element.", "Excellent!! Good Excellent This game is terrible. The graphics are s***ty. I wouldn't buy again if it were a dollar. IS HARD, EXCELLENT", "It seems as if it takes longer to be promoted, but I might be wrong.Even the retail trade is cool, but very hard to make money, although I think that makes sense This is a good game that will be even better if you have pets and seasons to it. Overall, I like this EP, but I hardly use it to be honest.This game gives you the ability to follow your Sima to work through the new professions Erich is exciting, but also very uncontrollable if you have more than one sim in your household.So basically I don't. EA urges its developers to pour out content while ignoring identified issues in the software.Since March (which may be the release date), there are reports about the bakery/retail issues that are recognized by EA, but continue to be unfixed.", "I almost didn't buy because some of the negative reviews were mainly about how bad it was to play Zelda: OOT. I must say that I am glad that I bought this controller. Immediately recognized in Win7. Set up was a breeze in Project64 2.1.0.1. I tried (so far) with Ocarina of the time, Goldeneye (first level) and Super Mario 64 (first level). The controller works exceptionally well. As for the bad reviews...maybe retro bit's quality control is missing in some aspects and those were the unfortunate people who used bad devices. In any case, for the most part, any inexpensive, made in China electronic device will not become an untouched, 24k gold, heavy duty, beat the game for you device. From unboxing, play Zelda perfectly in less than 5 minutes. Not to expect that absolute perfection and you are a good pair of articles in N64 is a good pair on your device.", "Works great with the original wii Works great with the racing games....many control when used with the Remote Plus....added action.....Price of wheels is inexpensive and really adds to the game...hope you will enjoy it as much as I do", "great it is a little loose fit, but still works super simple design and efficient. Provides a little extra grip and low protection. A little loose in some areas, but does the work.", "This made my children really happy. Works well, but not of the highest quality. One of the ports broke early, but the rest has been fine for a while. The cord is a little short, but this is a really practical adapter to have. I would highly recommend it.", "Excelente! First game didn't work, but contacted the dealer and they replaced it without any problems. Too violent big game", "muy buen producto It came on time and worked perfectly!", "It works perfectly to do this is not really mail's to do, since there are no problems 10/10 would run again for all PC/Wii U needs, and it even works with wireless controllers! Definitely it's worth it for all who want to play Smash Bros. for Wii U with a Gamecube controller. I was skeptical about the purchase, but I tried it and it just works well. With this and pairing with an official Nintendo controller will get the best results. In addition, I would recommend using it with Dolphin since direct support has recently been added to this device. That would mean that you can process it in its Wii U mode and Dolphin will enter exactly like a Wii (U).", "I haven't had a chance to play it yet, but I hear good things. I'm going to play both KH games before 3 comes. Everything was described as in excellent condition, very satisfied! Love this game!

I think I'll be ordering soon.", "Love the game! Very child-friendly! Very fun to play and make you think about how to solve some of the missions (: This game is awesome. I have it for my 7yo brother and we were both fighting, who is it's turn to play! (And I'm 22 lol) the Lego games are great and they don't disappoint. Good. 5 and 10 years old love this game. They found it after about an hour or so run around without any help. They play it on and off with other games, but its one of their favorites. If you have a dinosaur lover this is a game for you =) :D", "This game exceeded my expectations.The game has the fun, nostalgic feels of Halo, but leads new concepts as far as boss fights, story mode and the player vs player. Excellent game that you don't regret buying! Good game to a degree. Terrible texturing. You will accidentally stick to things and it will lead you to POE LVL 35 mining mines fail. Yes. That happened. Destiny where to start what a let down", "My 6-year-old loves this game. I was a little worried about him playing it. It's not scary at all. My granddaughter loves this game and that's all I need to know! The game is very cool. All Lego games are. The kids like that they become dinosaurs in this game", "Fun game good delivery Works perfectly and came 2 days before the schedule. Thanks a lot u", "What a great game! I bought this for my 7-year-old daughter, but as a Lego fan and a gamer himself, I've played every minute of it directly with her. It's accessible enough for a child to pick up and play, they even beat the game completely on their own. But it's also deep enough and fun enough for an experienced gamer to enjoy. If you love to play Lego and video games, this is a no-brainer!", "What are the following games likely to have in common: Gears of War, Bioshock, Mass Effect? All deserve Game of the Year awards. Thief is not a stellar or ground breaking game. But that doesn't mean it's bad. I get the feeling that people were disappointed in this game because previous games in the series were so highly rated. But this is my first thief game so that I had no expectations. Have the game free with &#34; games with Gold&#34; promotion.Graphics and framerate are technically good. Still, overall above average. And I think stable framerates really help playability in fps games. I like games like Splinter Cell, Hitman and Metal Gear moving in the city, textures taking time to load, self shadows are poorly done. Nevertheless, overall above average.

Soft on the bottom and top of the interior parts of the case, with the cover half rigid (it's like something you can still bend, but you'd have to try it). It's minimal, thin, and has a nice 3DS logo on it. Meets my needs to keep the thing unscathed and something protected while traveling / the behavior of this in a bag. You can't run a tank over it, but I don't work Oman Army base, so this works great for me. 10.99 value is fantastic. Great case, it also have slots for your 3ds games and the case is a bit hard (feel like hard plastic for me). Don't take much space and is very convenient when traveling. Kudos to Amazon for this fantastic case at a low price. Whenever I travel, I take my 3DS with me in this case. Does not fit the charger, but the games and DS are very great.", "Very cool love the blue color Finally for MSRP price. If its more than $13, I don't think you should buy it. Scalpers tends to continue driving prices so it was hard to find the rare. Product came in its original packaging, but the packaging was covered in some kind of dust. The dealer I bought it from, however, did not let me cancel my order so that was annoying.

It didn't work if you connect to your PC with the cable, you'll be able to find the driver installed on your computer # all to make your device manager, but it just didn't work, and trust me, that's not the problem of my computer, I'm not on the Xbox official website, they haven't called for work, and it's a whole lot of computers to do and do it.", "If the Xo four, but one side no longer work. Some switched to get the seven per this round... Love it. Have two in fact for my husband as well. It was a great purchase. It was delivered and got really fast. Great! It's great. My husband loves them and so do I. He gets to hear the dynamic game, and I don't have to! Played bf4 with these and they offer incredible sound. Very comfortable and feel very durable. They have the explosions and shooting has so much that you usually don't have a TV sound. Works great My child happy! Works as advertised. The sound is good, and the drain on the battery is not so bad. It can only reduce the game time of a fully charged controller battery by a few hours. The headset is somehow hard to hear on the head. I still haven't used it to move after a month, but it's with other simple headsets when the Mic is super sensitive, and you can't realize when someone says that you're listening to your device.", "Beautiful game Just perfect It would be a great game if it didn't freeze every time just when I got Trevor game is great, shipping sucked my grandson enjoyed this game a lot works fine", "Excellent service, package came well protected. 100% recomended.

This is a hidden gem on the ps3 when you spin based games. This was a released before trophies, but it's still a fun and challenging game.", "Works as it is meant. Fits to the controller and attacks the phone pretty well. Wish the phone holder folded to be more compact if not in use. Perfect fit.

I understand Exclusive), and since I already own a ps4, was very excited to see that there was a Batman Arkham Knight exclusive console.I bought this and installed it, and immediately it didn't work. I had to call Sony and troubleshoot it, and finally send it in service... and they ended up waiting for me a new console after 10 days. By the way, the new Sony sent me works fine.

How much more conviction do you need to buy this game? Grandkids loved it It's a very solid multiplayer shooter. Well, it's currently worth 20 $ price tag.

I played the hell out of this system through all my youthful years. (Time spent well, I could add! Turtle shells don't throw themselves, you know. Someone has to do it.)Today I still play that exactly the same NES I bought almost 30 years ago with my daughter. Mario is just as big of a hit with her today as it was for me in the 80s. Not too shabby considering that she was raised in a world where high res 3D graphics are a part of absolutely everything. The console has seen better days, but that was expected, it plays well but! The free game that it came with a lot of work to work, as it seems to be loose in the system. Overall, I am satisfied with this product, I recommend this seller. Super clean system as indicated.

This game no longer work two weeks later, even another great disappointment", "I did this for my Grandson who was thrilled with it. Arrived on time in perfect condition. Quite the largest controller ever made. Comfortable, responsive, intuitive. Works well! Use it as a gamepad controller for Windows 8.1 Shame that the d-pad is godawful recycle bin. This would be near a perfect controller if the designers actually decided to design a d-pad instead of hitting it in a well too big for them. It's not as terrible as the PSP-D-pad was, but man, it's not big. Considering that I've played, or at least tried to play a couple of 2-d sandcrollers and fighting games on it, it was simply not enough. It missed directions. It falls constantly between cardinal directions and diagonals with little rhythm or reason. And it feels musy and evil to use for any length of time. It's like any d-pad coming with another semi prespilled from it. Which is a shame because the rest of the controller is really well built.", "Perfect for my 7-year-old daughter who likes to dance and sing!

We had these for less than 6 months. I have two boys and these are definitely nice to have", "Good and I feel that my Xbox is safe, it works great to keep things going, something to note is that it doesn't fit the actual xbox disc case in Great Bag!

Perfectly, if I have to carry my Xbox one around, I don't have to worry about things popping in or scratching it.", "The boss fights are unique and something else for a dynasty warrior game. The levels are well done as well. Now for everything bad. Its repetitive, really repetitive. On each stage you need to find an element that is for a boss to beat, block an area, or beat a certain enemy type. If done right, it was fun, but the enemies are spam hard and a job to fight. Finally, the game is way too easy thanks to Boring so far", "great I received this product a few years ago and forgot to leave a review. It came to me in a good condition and everything worked perfectly. Only complaint is that the battery life was not amazing, but I did it for a while and it stills works.

Items inside the package were packed well with helpful documentation for issues you might experience with your older games.

I threw it on my Sim-Rig for F1 2013, F1 2015, and various F1-style cars in other games, and the additional realism as well as the excitement factor with an F1-style wheel is simply outstanding. I would definitely recommend who wants F1 Sims or just wants a wheel with a series of cool buttons on it. They are all a bit easier to achieve than most on my T500RS GT wheel, and the swing paddle shifter that remains with the hands through spins is fantastic. Great wheel. Would it be 5 stars if they actually set rotary switch instead of sticker on the front, but overall it works very well. A little overpriced, but what's not in the similar world?", "Awesome! Sensitive keys and the extra long chord is great. Exactly what we needed and came quickly", "Fun, it works great...", "I don't expect anyone to use this for the xbox 360 but for mocap.

Probably the best JRPG on the Vita, recommended even if you already beat the original on the PS2, because it's so much more in that time. I love it. This game and I must say the best ps Vita game.

Wild there is a 5/5, but the box Came damaged. All I expect I'll say again: buy this Japanese import and your grandmother will never know it wasn't from the states. Came exactly as planned and is beautifully packaged. Palutena looks good on my shelf with my other Amibo figures. This Amibo looks really nice in person, worth buying! I ordered this for my son, who collects Amiibos. He loves it and shows it. He's already downloaded this amiibo and recommended to friends who are looking for it.

The new designation for console with a controller and console with two controllers can only be between the standard bundle and the bundle with an additional new controller at a full price.

Also, the removable mic is a pain and not as good as the fixed flexible style of turtle beaches I used with my 360. Apart from that, I have no complaints as far as their function is concerned.

I'm please with my order It was complicated, but we have it out This is a great controller. It has a great feeling, and I use it almost daily to play many different games on my xbox 360. I personally love it because it has a smooth feel, and I can't even explain how fantastic the experience is when you play an immersive game like Call of Duty or Halo. Also, I think the battery life is great. It uses 2 AA batteries and it's worth the price when you buy it. Perfect! It's what it is. It works well, but these controllers break quickly.

It's just ok...sometimes the control stick and it's hard to get up from a creep and snake sometimes back against walls that don't mean it's back on. The goal may take a little while to get used to too.2) You'll die....A LOT....The game is not very easy on the & #34;easy&#34; attitude either.

The controller stack, so shelf space real estate is limited, which is nicely kept.The only negative I can possibly say about it after a year is that the LED chargers can be too bright for some places. I'm not sure that I can distract it in my bedroom, or right next to my TV as it might be. Take this into account before you get / use it.

If you are a Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball GT fan you would be crazy not to buy it. My only advice to buyers is a new disc because mine has a big scratch, but not deadly scratches. The game was great until the story is beaten. i kno the main thing is the online features, but the daily Dragonball z game of really old was always 2 players or more (not actually in conversation with 2 controllers) the 2 players sucks here that the only flaw&#62; #60; oh and healing came in a great state.", "Good Big game for car lovers", "I love the world and all the different quests.

I haven't played so good it is the player's not to hesitate.", "Great game!", "Compared to the other zelda amiibo, this is probably the best in my opinion not to keep up great gift to give to all who have not yet completed, they are zelda amiibo collection Well, for one, this was planned to arrive at mid-September and arrived almost a month early, so I HUGELY impressed by this. I'm strange and, instead of buying showcases for my amiibo, I open them with EXTREME care and keep them in the box, if not in use. Probably not efficient, but whatever. The box came completely undamaged and the amiibo was in perfect condition. Have it connected to my DS and will keep it in the next weeks between homework and practice hours. The shipping box was unwritten and a little sketching, but honestly I didn't complain at all. Early makes me VERY happy.", "cheapest on the internet. Fit is embarrassing, but somehow precise enough to work? Turn on the plug for TV (standard) or HD usage. I'm using the RCA typical non-HD setup and it looks / sounds great on my TV. I'm pretty satisfied overall as both the price and delivery time where very acceptable.", "Came exactly as expected. Brand new in the box.My only complaint is that the trap master are bigger than the GIANTS. But that's nothing on the product itself. Just one person of opinion for the team that created the trap team game. This was a hit with my grandson on his birthday. He loves playing Skylanders and this was a great element to add his collection", "No problems fun, but not what I expected", "Community Community Community Community Community Community Community

The plastic game holds case has a total of 8 games plus 2 memory card slots.", "Great charger for the price super.....", "Very fun by itself, plus all dlc?! Well worth the price It's a great game Perfect condition and great game! Love it!! Awesome game With an explosion to play it. Cheaper then walmart Fantastic game! Ready for Fallout 4! Can't wait! Have this for less than $15! Great price for a good game. I enjoyed all fallout games and this is no exception.", "Many reviews label this remote control as finicky, or require a kind of button to work smashed. But, as far as it works exactly like any other remote control. As long as it continues to work, I'll stay happy. Some back lighting would make it 5 stars. Still seems better than the Microsoft remote control, especially for the price. Great element beats on the XBOX One controllers have when your television the XBOX worked for about 3 days and then stopped working. Thought I would save a few dollars by choosing this instead of this Microsoft official remote control, guess that was a mistake. This is fantastic! I have the Microsoft media remote control also and will not throw it away. It's so much easier to use, see, handle, etc. A touch power-off required without confirmation. And the Xboxone seems, well no, IT DOES respond faster to this than the Microsoft one. Not to mention, this is pretty much cheaper BUY IT-------- you'll be happy. Would have set it up for them, but Abyx labels altogether, it's more decent.", "It came on time and it works well :-) Best game ever then and best game now! We are so happy to get this game. I bought this game for my nephew and he is so happy to have it. So thank you!", "Big headphones just the microphone is trash.

Fast delivery service. Get product used with it. Install disc worked well. But game disk seemed to have a dark half dollar size faded dark spot on it. Can read barley and skip until it can't detect. Kinda boomed out. The package was sent pretty quickly and there was no damage I'm satisfied and would recommend this game to old fans and re-purchased this cheap as a second copy of co-op mode with two xbox 360's playing.", "At first glance, this cable seems to be better than the competition. But if you have your Genesis connected to a good sound system, you will immediately notice that something is wrong. With my special cable, the right audio jack causes the sound to be muted. Also, the bass cuts all together. Connect the right audio jack and the bass back. So for now I will have to use my Model 1 Genesis.I will return this AV cable immediately.Edit: This is a message to HDE. I'm not sure if you're actually making this product or simply selling it. But after testing the pin-outs on the socket, it seems that you've wired the right audio channel to the mono signal, which would explain the muted sound. Another AV cable will correctly connect the left and right audio channels to their respective pins, which leads to much better sound.", "met my needs Cam unscratched, working condition, all ports worked", "The best version you need to get it at a reasonable price....What's really not to like! I love it kiss are all the card worked out. No problem here. Now I'm connected three months ago :) Everyone loves free stuff right? This came with the XBox package that I bought and worked like a charm. worked great Download an online code instead of going to a store and buying a card is very handy, I buy it to insert the code and start playing in less than 15 minutes overnight when all the shops are closed or far away, in resume, I love to start it, I want to say that X-Box Live always run the risk of unjustified transactions being made when your credit card subscriptions are stored on your X-Box 360 system.", "Great game. Great tool for learning. Many mini games that work on certain techniques. Some lessons that go from how to get a guitar to complex techniques such as pinch harmonics and two-hand taping.

Want to read more transition to more traditional tab.", "However, I knew this when buying the article from other reviewers, so I got my review from a 3 to a 4. My real reason for buying this article about others was that I already had the same model charging station for my PS4 (and love it!). As for the xbox one model, the only thing that keeps your controller based on gravity. And as we all know, sometimes gravity can be a finicky beast. Even the batteries delivered don't contain as much of a charge as the official rechargeable batteries from Microsoft.All in all, however, the device serves its purpose fine as long as you realize it's error. I've done my job based on other reviews, but I'm not really excited about this thing so far!It's pretty cheap for me to grab a replacement regulator if I need one.", "My kids love this game! It's nice that they have this family friendly interactive games for video games. The Kinect takes some getting used to / adapt in my opinion, but it's worth it when you do it. arrived on time.

My 21 year old daughter demanded this for Christmas and I was happy to find it. Works as expected, great price. Warning not buy.", "The shiny finish feels terrible even with little sweat. It also has no real triggers but buttons there. the price is ridiculous and Nintendo rips you off to get this controller for certain games - but I bought it anyway!! Works just good after the kids - they think it's a bargain - what do they know!!", "Great game! Amazing graphics. Good campaign mode. One of the best cod games I really enjoy playing it ok Excellent product and seller! Call of Duty seems to forget its roots. Not in the sci-fi aspect of the latest trappings. Have moved to Battlefield franchise for real military first-person shooter. Call of Duty has fed into the future and has left a part of its fan base behind. Previously traded in my initial copy but decided to buy again so I could play through the campaign. I must say that the multiplayer is the worst of one of the Call of Duty games, but the campaign is top notch.", "Great game. Gameplay is challenging, but fun, and the story line was interesting from start to finish. Great I found that this game was complicated to find out, I understand there are 19 buttons on a controller and I'm new to Playstations, so I'm not able to memorize different functions per button, always confused what a button does with from reference to the book guide.", "Delivered on time. Everything came great as expected. Very satisfied with the purchase. Built in Wi Fi included in this version of xbox 360. delivered as promised works as advertised, cheapest construction quality for the xbox 360.", "The graphics are not at the level of the next generation. We could get more time on the development. The evil within is a much better game. Admittedly, I ordered a copy towards the end of July almost a year after the game was originally released when I only got it when it came. This game is a must for any fan of alien movies and survival horror. The bad thing about this game is that they have a few glitches and character animation problems. Although the animation issues were especially after the update of the game also some bad voice of smaller characters. Amanda Ripley is a credible character and a protagonist that I was on all the way up. The alien is right down as it is a constant threat and its behavior is completely random, and the detail in it is amazing. The world is visually identical with the first alien movie that is great and the graphics are ingenious and the manual walks are quite memorable. The weapons are super hacking you can get out of some difficult situations with the Xeno, the Androids, and the survivors kill on Sevas Sievas.", "Cool cool Beautiful as expected", "great game very good", "My children lost interest in this game very quickly. It seems that the set requires more and more pieces, otherwise they are very limited in what they can do. I think it's because that they have lost interest. It seems it was more a money pit than anything else. Thank you very much.", "It's Minecraft!!!! My kids are addicted to it. It's not violent and really puts their creative juices to the test. This game is good for child. My daughter loves it. They design their own town. Cute little game. I didn't like it at first because of the strange square setting, everything is a square. But really like it when starting to play with my friend. Cool couple game. I like it who are protected and waiting for the sunrise haha Excellent It's Minecraft. On Xbox One. Can't complain at all. It's just a good game overall My 12 yr old AND 6 yr old sons love this game! Not all purchases carry over. All cards are transferable. Although that's a pain to do. Despite that it's all you know and love Minecraft.", "There is great grip on an otherwise slippery controller. it's a little shiver to get it in exactly the right place for the first time, but its manageable. I think the price is a little high, but it's a nice product. Wasent carfull and dirty mine up I would recommend a video on putting email on I have a set for the 360, and was relatively satisfied. The grip is solid, and feels fantastic. It fits the controller well, and does not get in the way. However, the glue that plugs the handle at the control could be a bit stronger; there are definitely a few problem points on my, which are always unstucking again.", "yes, I bought my renovated, what thateabs is that it broke in front of your front door I think so I decided s new ps4 instead and had no problems since the Dodd with hug Brought it a month ago and works brand new", "Great controller, I just wish microsoft would give us this controller with the xbox! The Play & Charge Kit is not good.The wire connection loses electrical contact and does not charge the controller effectively if you even move easily - like when you play the game....We went through 2 of them, and they both performed badly.I have gone with another charging solution.Great fan of Xbox One overall, and the microsoft controllers are good. But don't waste your money on this as a charging solution.", "Please don't waste your time! It slowly responds to first person shooting (FPS) game like Destiny, Far Cry, and etc. It can drive you crazy and commit Hara Kiri.", "the battery doesn't work and now playing with wire and no one replay to me when I ask for any help I was very hesitant purchase a renovated product as I have not always have had the best of luck but this was simply amazing. It was like they were brand new. My son absolutely loves this and the sound quality is AMAZING I bought gaming headphones for 20 years. This is the best set I ever bought. I would buy another pair today if I needed some.", "I did it. No bad price and I got the right version. Licks that scalpers one are always a step ahead. Only gets 4 stars for 1 day too late. Highly recommended, based on quality. THANK YOU Perfect as described. Fast Shipping. Amazing. Thank you so much that I really feel it's Shulk time. Now I can unleash the power of Monado, and put into it for battle training. Add gift for my daughter to her collection.", "Terrible. I'm very disappointed. I get the charger, but of course there is no cable included. Thank you Sony! ! I'd rather spend a little more and everything I need in a box. Sony people, how do you want to buy a new TV and open the box and find out that you need to buy the power cable because it's not included! ! Best way to charge the Vita a few times and it's an official Sony product. not last a week doze does not change works super", "I was really disappointed in this product. I received no instructions and after applying the skin, I removed the protective cover (it looked like it should be removed, but I could be wrong because I received no instructions) then no more than 1 minute later the design began to blur and come to my hands. I would not propose to buy this. Product came on time and the seller also included two free screen covers. The cover was easy to install and stayed on. We installed it over a month ago and have no corners lifting. We followed the instructions and cleaned the 3DS XL with the supplied cleaning cloths.We would recommend and buy from Ci-Yu-Online again.", "You have to be honest, the sequel is better, but you might want to play the games in chronological order, because the second starts after the end of this game. Apart from that, one of the best games I've ever played.", "Thank you MY SON LOVES PLAYING THIS GAME. its hard to play Who doesn't like animal crossing? Definitely one of my favorite games. my grandson loves this game", "Compliments each and all TurtleBeach headsets. Headset slips off.", "It can only be able to install that PS no more than the quick installation into the game. As I use internal hard drive. I bought the Nyko database for PS4 for a while back so that I can increase the amount of storage space on it for the hard drive I chose to use a Seagate 4TB SSHD SATA 6Gb/s cache 3.5-inch drive to make sure that a computer is using the drive on Ex fat with a computer not your PS4 or you crash the system. On the box it says to use a hard drive with 2TB or less, because the firmware will support nothing greater than 2TB it, up to a 4TB SSD and download the latest software update and then put your PS4 into safe mode to do that the work on the system you need to keep the new hard drive a flash drive with 1GB of memory or larger going online on www.playstaion.com", "As a gift for the grandson's birthday bought - he loves it! No complaints. Controller came quickly and works great. The controller I bought is a carbon copy of the one on the picture. Sony never failed to surprise me. I love the color and would recommend anyone to buy one. Again Sony. good controller, fast UPS shipping Excellent paintwork, reliable and comes in less time than expected THIS CONTROLLER WORKS GREAT. Works great and looks beautiful. How brand new! No cable charger came with it, that's ok! Good price and fast shipping. keeps separating, gettin angry while playing.... In the time and exactly how it was described the controller worked perfectly!", "Funny video game, but difficult levels lol Best puzzle game for the money. Intrigatestory and fun premise. awesome. I always wanted this game very good game was good, but short and can be boring after a while I hit 2 times already different ends", "The game is overall good, history is a possibly missing, as I imagine you would expect, but there is enough to drive the core of the game forward and you packed to your next action, barely clothed, battle party.The art in general is very nice and the artbook has some great pictures in it.The soundtrack is good, nowhere near one of my favorites, but definitely good.If I had a grip with the game, it is that the boss fights that Iv'e faced in the place of writing these are laborious without anything to keep the player interested in the fight, while they have been slogged by the large amount of health and possible multiple forms of bosses.For everyone without an American PS4, be aware that the DLC can't work for you, it didn't work on my Irish console so easy to keep in mind.", "It's really good for a starting FG newcomer. Broke within weeks", "I don't like that you can't use them on the first system, but my son is happy that she came with the superhero on the 2.0 system. We did this for our kids as a Christmas present and we had hours of family fun playing and fighting together and against each other. The characters are made of the same plastic as the first and when you kick on certain they break, but they are pretty robust compared to that. We bought the carrier bag and the showcase to make sure they were always put on so they don't break as they are on the first system. Great purchase for any family fun or game night. Disney missed so much with Infinity 2.0 and it pale compared to Skylanders for the story mode. Hopefully Infinity 3.0 is a much better offer.", "The left analog stick keeps breaking. The new controller is beautiful. The left and right bumper button click much easier than before, and the new 3.5 mm jack works well too.Pros: improved bumpers, 3.5 mm jack, Cons: It sucks when you need to navigate your own headphones through a series of settings menus to adjust the game, chat, and microphone volume. but meh, you get used to it. I just got this controller. It's impeccable... It's great! I ordered this element and received the base controller, not the 3.5 mm jack. Buyer beware. Works as expected This has built in the headphone jack, so that the woman is not worth anything else, I can play my games without interrupting them.... happy woman, happy life... Excellent I just received this July 9 today is august 26 left triger sticks right stick locks in different directions it's not worth avoiding $5 without interrupting them.", "exelen very good", "Dollar Tree has better things than this. I didn't even have it for an hour before it broke, fortunately I was able to fix & #34;kinda&#34;. Don't waste your time or your money. I just got it & its broken.... Help The battery pack doesn't really fit the controller. Completely useless and a waste of money! Broke on the first day we used it. Extremely disappointed. They held a charge for a very short time, and after 3 or 4 charges, they finish taking a charge completely. We had ordered 2 sets, and they both finish. Waste of money. Battery and the stand it lights up really good", "I bought the red version of USPRO and it works well, except that the battery doesn't last almost as long as my official $50-sony controller. Not an offer, you can still play for many hours (I would say at least 6 on a full charge, maybe longer, I've never counted). Other than that, it looks, feels and works exactly like the real thing and is identical in every way, except it says & #34; P3&#34; on the middle button instead of the official PS3 logo. The joysticks have a beautiful rubber grip to like the real controller. My 3 years old loves it and will only play with this controller now. He has used it daily for about a week to play various LEGO games without any problems at all. I don't know if the Rumble/vibrate function works or not, as I have only used the controller itself very briefly, but for this price that cares. Another thing to note is that the controller automatically shut down if you don't work after a certain (and fairly short) time.", "My son is really enjoying this game he can't put it down. Thank you. For having it in stock. And for your quick service. Thank you Mrs Phyllis Boris I Love Amazon Great game. Value every penny Very great game. If you're looking for a game to keep your man from your back, don't look any further. Very good quite the best game I've ever played. You certainly know how to get the second half of the game into a subpar version of Twisted Metal Excellent I like the fighting controls and the bat, but it's this game that I hate the lack of hand to hand boss fights and the end of history.SPOLERAfter you figure out Arkham Knight is red hood you won't even fight just to destroy a few Gargoyles and yours done and if Toddroke show that he's in a tank at the end of the story Batman this is the last time everyone knows who he is. he can put hush pretened to destroy Batman.", "As a family we enjoy spending time together, this was a great choice every family member has to play with it. We bought this for our energetic 10 years old, doing to make the song selection available. The product was new, the price was affordable after getting this in local shops. Shipping was fast. She loves to dance to the Wii game.", "his favorite - he loves this game, always play it. I think it's too redundant. Always do the same always and always. Super Awesome! Love the game, always played with friends, but never actually had the game. Now I put it, awesome! Assassins Creed in the 1600's pirate era in the Caribbean. I loved ship to ship battle. I loved the graphics. I'm in history. The only thing I didn't like was to go out of the historical immersion to the Sci-Fi Abstergo offices to collect post-it notes. I work in a high-tech office--I play this game to escape from it! Awsome game son happy Best Assassin Creed game yet - trying to copy it success with Rogue but failed. Great game for pirate enthusiasts, but missing some of the stealth charm of most other entries offer well. Still a great game in its own respect, and adds a beautiful spin to the series.", "good I have made this controller for almost a year now and wanted to post my review. Plus :Nice LookWorks just like the standard controllerMinus :- Cheap. It hasn't broken, but at the edge of breaking. Symptoms a bit larger than the standard controller. I go back to the standard controller and it feels a little smaller than this. Absolutely love this controller, defiantly worth the money!! Looks great and feels fantastic", "Not as pleasant as I've hoped. The loading times and instant death QTE has made me feel pretty fast at this. What's a shame when you consider how much I loved Shinji Mikami's previous work. If you absolutely love Resident Evil 4 style gameplay, this game will feel pretty good. Excellent!!! Exelent Decent game If you're bored of your standard fps and want to try something challenging and new, try this out. It's not perfect, especially on the story side of things, but the intense and rewarding gameplay has me through again for the second game. This is Gore version of the resident evil / Silent Hillif you love horror and enjoyed something the movies & #34; Saw&#34; This is the perfect game for youAtte: I removed 1 star because the way to play the games in & #34; Chapters&#34; is not that good idea came to meNote: The case came to me, I don't know if its Amazon or the shipping fault, but the game made it ok.", "No Japanese right-rack made me sad. Otherwise good. Great game so far. Ragequit for a while after increasing relationships and sharing teenagers' fear banter several times with a character just for them to betray me. Gameplay is quite similar to Walkyrie Chronicles in my opinion, without the fact that I no longer aim. Only gripe is that I'm the &#34;spot of the traitor&#34; voice thing was a little defined.", "Excellent classic!", "I'm an optimist, so I ignored the many bad reviews on this product. I shouldn't have been an optimist. Complete trash. Product is bent where the 2DS is flat. Impossible to secure the device. Look elsewhere for a case. I didn't like this at all. It barely snaps at the 2ds and even the smallest fall, it just pops off. It's useless.", "She loves not to play frustrating for her. You can have 2 players and change her appearances, outfit and accessories. Just approach mirror one of the second floor left stairs. This game requires nunchucks! Can't start without it. Game consists of twirling the wiimote as a magic wand in different directions and moving character with nunchucks toggle. You get to play in every princess world with your own difficulties. With two players you turn around doing challenges / mini game. Doesn't seem to beat Ariel's world for long. I bought this for my four years old and she absolutely loves it!!! Some things are a little bit difficult for her to find, but it's a perfect game for younger children to wander and a princess. She loves designing her own clothes and features every time. We don't play many video games so maybe that's why she fights a little, but it's not a big deal. The game is a perfect in game.", "So I love the game features. But I don't recommend the game at all. The new city that is added with all the new game features doesn't work. It's constantly freezing cold. And no. It's not you. It's not your computer. Do not uninstall any other expansion packages. It's just the city. This expansion package is one of the best I've ever got. Running a resort is really fun, plus the extras like fishing for sharks, boating and windsurfing are great.", "My kids begged for the demo, and it's now one of their favorites. Love I enjoy the game overall, but my copy seems to be glitchy. I've played through the second to last level, and then froze it on a editing scene, so I'm not able to progress.I also experienced the & #34;cat #4 unbreakable bank&#34; glitch in Bricksburg, which is annoying, but something you can play around.Overall, still as fun as most of the other games in the series, but possibly not as great for gameplay issues. Well. It's fun if you like the movie, but a little repetitive at times... don't pay the full price, I think I've got it for $10 and it's worth it, kids were in it for a couple of months, and it's been a few months.", "Good Entertainment EXCELLENT Great game", "I love this game. In fact, I'm actually playing it again a second time. The reason I hit a star is because the end of the game was oh so rushing. I like it, all pages quests (conquering the Borgia, searching for all Romulus keys, thief tasks, etc.) and, I forgot what order, but towards the end you have no choice to refuse the search it's just going until you have finished the game. NOW of course it can actually be a way to go back and finish the pages quests, but I obviously have no idea or not to this effect. Son happy", "Great game! I love this game! If you like PvZ and Call of Duty, you will love this game! I wish I could give him 1 million stars!", "I grew up with Mortal Kombat and this game is definitely on my own. Recommend to every fan of fighter or comic hero. Nice", "It's a great adventure puzzle game with an amazing storyline, all the characters are very sympathetic and it all wraps up beautiful big game, great story and you can't stop playing it! :D", "It's not even 1 TBA for a price like that. Unless they just do this in a region or country, I wouldn't pay as much for a 500gb ps4. What's the hack this price comes from? Greedy Greedy Greedy WAAAAAAAAAY too expensive. If the price was converted into US money, it would come to $373 and change.", "This was a gift for my brother..He was very happy with him thanks.Game was in good form Great addition to the Resident Evil series. Very much worth the game by!", "our favorite video game! We have loved all Donkey Kong games in the past and this is no exception. Great graphics, fun to play and really like the addition of Dixie and Cranky. My 7-year-old son loves to play it together with the adults. Would recommend!", "Great headset and microphone, but with the PS4 and that's a MAJOR factor I never knew, the Amplifier (Bass & Treble) does NOT work on PS4. I spent a lot of time looking for a good microphone set and that's it, was pissed on about the AMP(Bass & Treble), but unlike that it's convenient, has a long track that's always good. The total volume could be higher, but again I'm going to put this on the Amplifier problem. Overall, happy with it, I've never experienced the amp works so really I don't know what I don't always handle with care, but everything on it still works well. Works with my Iphone 5s, PS4, TV, basically everything with a headphone jack. Amazing gaming headphones, I've had mine for over a year now and not always deal with care, but everything on it works well.", "AAA+++ Brilliant", "Not as user-friendly as we ordered this for myself for gaming and have used it for a few weeks at this point. The main reason I chose this headset is because in video reviews the microphone sounded amazing and hands down almost every other $50-100 headset I looked at. The headset does not disappoint, microphone quality is excellent and I have no complaints about the audio, no static or hissing as far as I can say. The control box has a lot of great features and works as advertised. No big complaints about the comfort, ears are completely covered, although occasionally I get a little pressure on my jaw. ONE WORD OF WARNING THOUGHI had trouble working the device properly at first, seemed as if it would start to synchronize drivers, fail and not work. I looked inside and apparently the headset could not have enough power from the USB despite a brand new computer with a solid motherboard. I don't know if it's a common problem, but the solution is to use a powered USB hub that I had (it's acord).", "Just what I needed works great Excellent", "10/10 would play again you have my business for sure! Thank you I love this game", "Fantastic fits my PS2", "I loved this game! Great game mostly well developed and a lot to do. Expect to play 35-40 hours honestly I wanted the Elite N7 single player weapons, and worth the extra mile, including the other add ons", "My son loves it !! Great price We bought this as a combination with a fire lit for our 9 years old. I think it frustrated her more than anything else. Luckily, her grandmother bought it for her Xbox as well. She never plays with this as it had connection problems all the time. We love the Skylander products, but this was a miss. The app doesn't work!!!! Numerous reviews since the last update....installs just good, compatible decide....I checked reviews, but I should have checked Google Play reviews on the app install....Now I'm stuck with a brand new useless toy!!! Smh! Will try to get compensation from activision. WARNING! WILL YOU HAVE ANDROID! Total does not work on my Samsung...so irritated.", "It was what we needed and doesn't work great for the DS!!

My 5 year old loves this. It's challenging, but still simple enough for his age.

Very fun to play them", "My son (10) enjoys the game alot. HP with Windows 7, no problems download. awsome game", "My son wanted this game for his birthday. He rented it in the video store in the past, so I know that he likes to play it. I really enjoyed Arkham Origins. Before buying it, I was a bit hesitant because of the lukewarm reviews. However, I bit the ball, and have no regrets. The game mechanics are very similar to Arkham City, with some small gadget variations. Overall, the game plays great, although there are some small hiccups, such as a small break during the cutscenes, or small grinds that the enemies when you interrogate them. If you are on the fence about buying this, I would recommend you. From now on, I feel it has the best boss battles among the 4 Arkham games, in addition to the best story line.", "MY SON LOVES IT quality seems pretty good, I like it I don't love it, doesn't seem to be worth the higher cost", "It's awesome rust this is a great product for anyone who knows how to use it. Unfortunately, the one I got finicky and often separates in the middle of rewriting the profile. It worked and came here in time. The only problem was that it doesn't work on the snow Leopard 10.6 mac as it says. Fortunately, I have a laptop and can still use it. It works great. It works.", "Kids loved it. Great game For the price, I like it. Fun with good for the exercise. I like it better than paying $2 per song with Dance Central Xbox One. Can have many players. Will soon 2014. Lots of good songs. Have additional free songs. And of course, videos of themselves always look so silly. Excellent Our guys love it", "It serves its purpose well, not great for shooter games, but works wonderfully well with everything else. I played games like Skyrim, nba 2k, and Assassins Creed without any problems. Would give 5 stars if it wasn't for dead zones in fps games, but great. 1994", "Thank you... Only able to use it as a USB headset, but it works great. Only problem is the airflow to my ears is not big, so they are hot after wearing them. I bought this as a gift for my husband, but we landed them back because they do not connect to the controller. We would have put them in the PS4, which would mean a long string over our living room. He tested them before we brought them back but said they fit comfortably and the sound quality was great.", "Works just as well as the original. No problems and price is not bad. Good that I bought it is not the charger as indicated. it is the power cable. choose words wise seller. Charger vs power adapter or power cable is a HUGE DIFFERENCE!", "Not the correct Owen cord. Doesn't even fit. Don't buy for Snes! PLEASE READ THE REVIEWS!I've made a terrible mistake because it doesn't even work for my Snes. The cord doesn't fit into the Snes.

Purchased this for my children and it is one of their favorite characters. Arrived quickly and as advertised.", "Action packed game children love. excelente husband loves this game. Call of Duty gets more attention than I do! LOL But really, it's a cool game I HATE THIS game with a passion. It has terrible graphics and is very, very unrealistic. I play COD for reality and good graphics. This game has none. I was very surprised to and a little upset because I spent so much on it and waited a week for it in the mail.", "Get the first and it wouldn't work at all. The second would start but would lock before you could play it. Both had disk read errors. Arrived quickly and works great. I see many fun times ahead with this game.", "Cheap. The headphones are really small and do not go around your ears. They hurt if you wear them for more than 15 minutes. Purchased 1 month ago and use it daily. Crystal clear sound in full stereo system, microphone works well and sound is clear, after people I speak in PS4 games. I really enjoy courage button and volume control. They really work well and are very easy to set up and operate. My only complaint is that the ear covers are too small, so they become uncomfortable after a while. Also, it is hard to find a product like this for the price. Excellent quality and we will continue to buy this brand for its performance and lower price. I bought these headphones so that I could play PS4 while my wife slept at night. I work late at night and my wife is usually sleeping when I go home. This headset fits perfectly to the bill. It is a little small and the ear shells could be a little bigger while my wife sleep.", "I was not disappointed at all by this game. Perfect introduction to the next chapter of the series. Excellent game! It very short bad very bad This is a great game with fantastic graphics only real problem is its very short. This was for the Metal Gear fans like me!", "So I just got my controller in the mail and it looks great and just seems to work well unless it's black. Now that wouldn't be a problem if I hadn't specifically chosen the blue one. And the black one costs less, so I paid more than necessary for the product I got. Even though I revved it, it was just a controller and got packaging in bubble foil. Call me picky, but I prefer to be unopened my new elements and in their original box. Plus the sticker on the bubble foil it even says it's & #34;seablue&#34; Who ever wrapped this and sent it to me knew what they were doing, they just didn't care. I would send it back, but I need a controller to play my games and I'm already irritated to the point of giving. Really nice controller just the place for the battery is somehow hard to find.", "The screwdrivers worked great These tools work great, but I found someone without the curious tool you don't really need at Walmart for much less. But these have a rotating handle that makes them easy to use", "Really nice More than I thought I would get it. Love it. It reveals quite a lot of everything. You have to take your time on it, but it's worth it.", "Great game awesome, just awesome. I'm a fan of RPGs, and I loved the concept of this game. so creative and fun.", "The best so far. Great solid game. Really so funny! Good.", "This is one of the most frustrating gaming experiences I've ever had. Graphics are great, game is Spot on.This COULD have another halo type of game (but with RPG and MMO elements). I took 3 stars away because of the sh*tty server at Bungie and always started from Xbox Live all the time. Bungie is SUPOSEDLY \"working very hard\" (as per Bungie.net), but this game has been released for literally MONTHS now (new DLC has even), and not one thing has been fixed. I'm always close to a mission and BANG! I get black shielded or started live, or else it's a \"caterpiller\" error. And save your checkpoint? HELL NO. Gotta start the level again from everyone. SO FRUSTRATING!!! Is this bungie idea of a joke? This game was RUSHED on the market. Bugs gallore. Thanks a lot I've used it for $20.", "I bought this when I was working in a machine store and I needed something that would protect most of my DS from dirt and debris.As a result, my review comes from a somewhat biased place as every case had to work really hard to do its work.The case itself fits well, although I had to take a few minutes to figure out how to do it. If you have your DS too much or too little open, you can't do it on or off. It's a decent clear, so the color doesn't overly compromise what I like. It's robust enough that I don't have the feeling that it has a problem protecting my system, although it's not padded, so a decent effect would still break the machine. However, I think it doesn't do a fantastic job to dust and grime out, with all the means.", "Excellent works great", "I was thrilled to get this headset. Was.. I only give these 2 stars because of the head sets beauty. I love the way it looks. Sound quality...ehhh. Too muddy. Many mid-range frequencies. At 50 dollars I wasn't with amazing quality. The thing that threw me right back into the box was the left speaker going after the 1st bet! Wasting my time. Very nice headset feels very good on the head I can fit the headset over the ears and head sounds super better than most headsets iv tried. And iv tried 100red of different types of headsets and TRITTON headsets has found the best iv in the market for the PS4 and music.", "Was a gift! OK, so this game may not be an AAA title and is sometimes glitchy, but it's damn fun. I really enjoyed the 32 hours or so it provided. Good classic RPG stuff here. At the price for the question for this title, it's a no brain.", "Great audio quality. Works extremely well, microphone is very clear. It's not better than other brands, and you can't beat the price. They work well. Use as PS4 headset earphones. Be warned that only an earphone works when only chat audio goes to headphones. Both work when you send chat and game audio to headset. Okay tone, but god they're unpleasant for anyone, but someone with big ears. I don't have particularly small ears, but I'm female. The design of the outside has sharp angles and they press on tge delicate cup of ears. After a while they really start to hurt a lot. Bad design. Or at least design great for guys. For $10, these things have longer than literally 9 other headphones I have at the same time. Mute slider is a must for ps4 chatting, I even had to use it to run out in a pinch. I bought this with my PS4 controller because my Bose in-ear didn't work properly.", "Awesome fun game very unique. Definitely worth buying! Excellent game", "The game is amazing, but the copy I got was broken. I ended up getting it from Walmart. excellent", "Rare accessory no longer found in stores, collect now as long as supplies last. Otherwise, this is a very good case for Vita 1000 or 2000. Good quality, beautiful padding inside Pretty big and smells great. Can fit 5 games and they never fall out. Beautiful soft material.", "Great works great, have used it a lot and never any problems. Great for gaming. would recommend. Big mouse, I'm a graphic designer in training and this mouse fits very well to my needs. I also love the blue lights. The scroll is beautiful and smooth and the mouse itself is a bit longer, perfect for people with larger hands. Overall, I love it. Wishing you could change the speed plugged it in, and it works like a charm. No problems. This May 2013 on a recommendation for a cheap gaming mouse with good performance. It is used a few hours a day for gaming. Over 2 years later, it's still strong and my husband is the preferred gaming mouse. It's been two years since I bought this product, and it still works well. If you need a working mouse, and don't worry about additional buttons, fancy configurations, etc. Don't look any further. Excellent I didn't give it too much... in the end I gave it my Bro games... and he loves it! Very cheaply, made in the hand to keep it, I really lost it and don't care.", "Good quality only problem is the smell of the earcups, but excellent sound. Very poor quality. Not expected that this quality only tries to make the headset and they work perfect sound quality and microphone works great. Also on my phone tries and it works everything with my music and videos and calls to make. I recommend this headset bought this at Prime Day and worked great for a while then the plastic tape has already broken.. I stream and need something reliable and that was not it.. P.S. i Baby my equipment and they were not abused, they are simply made cheap set to break very easy, plastic parts that connect the headphones and connecting rod are not durable.", "One of the best Mario games for handheld 3DS! My daughter LOVE it. A game for everyone with a 3DS have. Honestly, you can never go wrong with Mario. My file has 5 sparkling stars, so I can't say this is not a fun game if you have all the time I've sunk into it... However, it has big flaws.1. First, the forced & #34;2.5-D&#34; perspective or whatever the technical term is. I have the camera in this game. Mostly, it moves only when Mario moves so that if you're in one area and it's an enemy just offscreen, the camera near does not attack to move the enemy until you can move.", "I love these games absolutely! I had years 1-4 and finished that in about a week so I had to buy immediately years 5-7! I love all the Lego games and could only play them all day :) As a gift given - it was a hit!", "Great game! Awesome movie! Great product as listed. Prompt shipping Best Mortal Kombat I think I have ever played, although its missing a few characters that I would really like to see again.

Probably the best case you can buy. Looks great.. Fits perfectly.. Great protection for 3Ds.", "Everything was as promised. Thank you! was a fan as long as I can remember great games, great quality. Product came quickly and as described. New.

If you expand them to make them bigger there is only a thin plastic piece that unfortunately snaps super lightly and leaves you with a few battering earpieces that are completely useless. Love them! I didn't buy these here, but at Walmart on 23.08.15 and I have to say the sound quality is pretty good and the setup was also easy, but one thing I noticed was when playing mw3 online I couldn't hear the opponents steps while they closed on me, maybe I didn't set it right or it's a function that they missed. If someone can help me it would be very appreciated. Impressed with the quality and sound, but the microphone will not be for any reason I've tried everything, but can't find a solution.", "The pa4 is amazing, the last of us is a pretty good game also love this system!

I recommend between.", "Great headset! I love the fact that you can release the headset from the amplifier and use it on your phone. But apart from that, sound effects are really kool as you can customize bass & treble. ideal for playing games and music on my PC These headphones sound amazing and work really well until they have stopped working.Not sure whether it's the headset or my teenager son too rough with them... This headset design is defective, probably of choice.You stormed on the plastic quality and not to amplify the pages properly. If you use it quite normally, never fall it, treat it with perfect care, it will break. Just over the headphones, the plastic cracks if it's only slightly tensed (by what we all need to do to use a headset -- put it on), and will finally break through completely.Don't get me wrong -- the speaker and microphone quality are wonderful. But they wanted to keep the price low, and skimped elsewhere. Stay away from this headset if you plan it.", "Good stuff!", "I'm about three quarters in this game and call it over. You can't save your progress, but need to play from & #34; save points&#34; at certain points during the game. This fate you have to play the same mission over and over and over again... until (if) you succeed. Due to the tedium of the same missions I have to play the game on & #34;easy&#34; just so I could achieve any forward movement through the game.Worse is that if you die, the game throws you back at a random point of origin on the map. I thought it would save my progress to that point, so I could pick up where I died on the map where you were last to continue playing.

Go Hawks", "I haven't finished the game yet, but so far on the PS3 it looks great, is a lot of fun and has entertained me as my going to ps3 game of choice this year when I have time to sit down and play. Excellent game! I love this game. Maybe it's the pirate theme (something not done in many video games) or the ship battle (another thing not found in many games) or the tropical atmosphere. The historical story appeals to me although I generally find stories in video games boring. The modern component is missing, however, especially for those who appreciate the Desmond story of previous games. The sea shanties are so addictive! Amazon had the cheapest price and fastest delivery speed on this game when I bought it. My friend and I both enjoyed it very much. This is my favorite Assassin bitter Creed after finding date. A great adventure and in addition to the Assassins Creed line. My wife actually played when she has little patience for the fight against the Navy.", "required adapter for standard headphone jack large", "It's praised.", "Decent game, wish it had actual dinosaurs talking about a payout IGN gave this game 9/10 lol what a joke. You must have played for an hour and continued to write their review of this. This game is fantastic for the first day maybe even a few days, but man does it old QUICK. If you thought Destiny was repeating and missing content wait until you play this, it makes Destiny look like a top 5 all time game. This game has 0 story mode it reminds me of calling the duty multiplayer except worse with no campaign mode. So much day a dlc though most have nothing to do with the game you still have to pay to change colors or display new monsters / hunters and for a game that is missing in the content that everything should be free. You might also have the most DLC of all next gene games and it's all useless, instead of making all this time dlc they should have crazy a campaign mode. At $20 I think it's worth a try, but you make it boring fast.", "I really appreciate that the game is a 4.4. This is my favorite fighting game on the PS4. The sexiness is a great plus. But I think it tries to be half tasteful. The core gameplay is fantastic as you would expect from a DOA game. You have lots of things to unlock, many modes to play, many characters. Here's a handle. How many iterations of DOA5 there were? Plus, Ultimate, then Last Round. Same Arta applies with Street Fighter IV. Many versions that add to the other. But in the last round, I made the mistake in assuming that all dlc would be included that it would have been if it were the final version. And it's painful to scroll through the costumes, and see that there are tons of costumes that are locked due to dlc. It's a terrible teaser. Every time you play the game, it stuffs the costumes in your face and says \"nearly you have neaner neanview.", "Only took 20-30 min after full charge also did not fit my PSP did not work at all.", "I bought this game for my great sons and they love it they say his cool too much quissing for kids Excelente", "Amazing product The best I have used and I have it on my ps3 and ps4 controller", ":) This is a great football game.

The campaign is long in a good way. Each level is about 45 minutes. This game is really great in variety. They are a lot of weapons to choose to start and wen more in the campaign! The animations are great! You get slo mo camera when you get a great shot with the sniper gun! The graphics are Xbox a graphics! Horse mode is really intense! You won't always be at level 30 easy like cod zombies. This game needs more skill! I recommend this game! It's really awesome! I like it!", "Extremely difficult to get (said your mother). They rub a lot (said your mother). Works well on my PS4 controller analog sticks where the rubber was peeling off.

I just want them to bring a real Persona game like 3 and 4 or even 5 on the 3Ds. This game is really awesome! I was never in the Etrian Oddesy games, but with the Persona character in it made me pick this game. Little disappointed I don't get Tarot cards, but that won't stop me from doing it a good rating. This game was a terrible crossover. It reduced the characters to stereotypes, which made some characters, like Teddie, intolerable. The story is almost non-existent and replaces S. connections with short sections, so often a healer would heal himself because their goal died before their turn. The fight is terrible to get rid of the game 1more system in favor of the thrust, which was a poorly thought-out game, downgrade.

I used third-party drivers that are easy to find on Google and installation was a breeze on Windows 10 Pro. I have a working camera/microphone now with excellent image quality and virtually no motion blur for almost nothing. There's really no reason to spend more money than this on a &#34;real&#34; webcam if you can have it. Good camera for the price. Excellent, all is fine.", "not impressed. Overheated.

Here's why...DurabilityThe two black columns with the green wires inside are made of metal. The rest of the headset is hard plastic. The structure of these things are incredibly good together.

I bought this remote control for my sons ps3 cause our dog ate its original remote control. This is exactly like the original and the seller was quick and reliable I would buy again if I needed.

The characters are made of the same plastic as the first and if you kick on certain they break, but they are quite robust compared to it.

In a good light you can see the orange color tone. But if the PS4 will be in a darker room like inside or in a closet the color is reddish like the true MGSV PS4.-Prints on the skin is not sharp.

It's like the game wants you cough quarters every time you die. More flexibility in the quest system they would use, and imo, camouflage kills a lot to see until you're very close, a design choice that kills stealth from behind quickly feel cheap and too easy to get, and the longer you play, they're using them, and imo, do things are very much to do.", "This was an interesting game to play.

If you take a break for example, and it shows an enemy captain, it takes the game a few moments as it loads the character layer by layer (so first you have the basic outline, then some armor, then some more armor, then some new shades, etc.).

The characters are made of the same plastic as the first and if you kick on certain they break, but they are pretty robust compared to this. We bought the carrier bag and the showcase to make sure they were always put on so they don't break as they are on the first system. Great purchase for any family fun or game night. recommended. Gift - he loved it. Just perfect.", "Great price, but only took about a month before it stopped working I was hesitant b/c the other reviews were so back and forth, but it works great. We had no problems and use it almost every day", "Gave as a gift -- son loves it. Excellent a lot of fun", "Whoever thought these headphones are worth 300 bux is serious jokes themselves. Awful surround sound, volume extremely low. Waste of money, these are probably the best headsets on the market for ps4, very disappointed. Most of the eq presets are useless. Using &#34; movie signature sound&#34; preset for almost everything. But nevertheless, overall experience - almost perfect.", "My kids love Lego. We bought this for my son for xmas because he played it at a friend's house and loved it. It was a game that the whole family can play and it has some adult humor that I think is about my kids heads, or at least my husband and I laughed and they didn't. Big game. Legos is always a family event. This game is great, but can be beaten pretty quickly. I have a 7-year-old and a 9-year-old and they are allowed to play 2 hours of video games a week. They beat this game pretty fast and were both like & #34; That was it???&#34; I think I expected more of a Lego video game. They still loved it, they would take longer to beat it. Compared to other Lego games, this is poorly executed.", "Awesome awesome game I mean Madden football....if you like soccer buy it!", "I love it! The system layout is beautiful and the graphics are so much better. The only thing I didn't get used to is where the Stylus is at. Best console I've ever bought. My custom gaming PC is little more than a Google machine, because I had this. if you get Pokemon this. if you like Mario get this. if you get social games. if you like puzzle games get this. This thing puts all the mobile games to shame.Do wish the battery life was a little longer. But I've got it on almost 24/7. I'm 23 years old I've got bigger hands than the average. and this XL is just barley the right size. If you find much bigger hands you can keep it uncomfortable. This $200 console doesn't come with a charger! I knew it didn't come with a charger and I didn't order one with the console because I thought the charging port is one of these universal usb type plugs for which I have a few chargers. It turns out that one own Nindo plug is in this console.", "Product as described, fast delivery. Thanks. Great game for the gamecube", "PERFECT! Thank you!! Terrible does not work. I wanted it for my little children who have a hard time with the wii controller. Very angry.", "works great.. Works as new :)", "It was great what I needed. Prefect! Just what I had expected to receive. I love the length of the cord itself.", "Amazing for price First thing I noticed was the microphone quality is exceptionally bad. I didn't expect anything big, but an 8 dollar external microphone is better than this. 2. thing is that the construction quality is pretty bad. Pieces of plastic have started to crumble from the sides only after 2 months of light usage. This didn't affect the performance directly, but I'm worried how long this piece of plastic will hold together. The audio quality is great, which makes it a shame that these 2 issues really bring down the whole product. These headphones are great! I decided to squirt on a nice pair of headphones, and these are wheeled. They are SUPER convenient. However, it has only a single audio port for input and output, so if your device has a separate microphone socket then you will either have a 3-&#62;4 3.5mm audio converter (converter output + input into a single cable, the plug into the headphones for the microphone) or you need to attach the USB (the is a HUGE cable)", "It was a pleasure to get two of these controllers for a price and they worked perfectly. My husband plays his Nintendo NES daily. They don't work on time delivered", "My daughters (age 11 and 7) both love this game.They never seem tired of the songs and enjoy playing with other people around the world. Pretty nice. You should try it Okay THIS GAME RULES! Our kids love this game for some reason. We have an 11-year-old boy and a 7-year-old girl, and this game is perfect to let them run some energy on rain or days that are way too hot to go outside. You need some space for this game, at least 10X10 if you play more than 2 people at a time. A person can play this in a 5X5 ft range. This keeps the kids for 30-60 minutes straight. Great training, great Cardio. Really recommend that you have the PS camera for this game. Not nearly as much fun if you need to keep the controller.", "great product I like the older version of Doom much better. It played very well on a PC from the hard drive. With this running through Steam is crap. What happened at all, only able to install a game and play it? Create and play with an online login is a pain. Also, I couldn't get the game to work - it kept freezing in the opening credits. I confirmed my system was compatible so the game is just crap.", "My son didn't complain about it.", "Probably the funniest game ever! Could it play all day! I mean, your Assissian won't get any cooler then that big thing I wanted", "It's fantastic, it works great I ordered the U.S. version, but got the Japanese version??? Definitely not U.S. version It came as a perfect package. Perfect", "The game is very short and doesn't have a lot of boss fights. Doesn't give the same feeling as Sonic generations on console. The best thing about this game was playing through classic Sonic Stages. This isn't really a review, but above all, what I like about this game in my opinion.Although shorter than the Xbox 360/PS3 version, Sonic Generations for the 3DS is still a fun game...BUT I wish there were more levels. They weren't even a stage of Sonic Heroes, although I think the Special Stages and Stage Select soundtrack make for them...I think. One thing that both versions of the game did right was, however, with chemical facility zone and Casino Night Zone by Sonic 2 as I thought were the best memorable reviews of this game. The rival battles here were meh...not really special for me and the Time Eater boss I must admit was less frrusting than the 360 version. The stadiums are lush and beautiful, a lot of Tropical Resort and Emerald Coast.", "Good Article Great extension to the third installment of this game franchise. Only marginally better than the great abomination that Diablo 3 is because the auction house no longer exists, so that items that drop actually help you. But wait! You can't trade any of your items. Props to Blizzard for ruining fun for everyone at one level once thought to be unfathomable.", "Bad ass! Five stars of all gta's this is the most fun and everyone knows if there were two players like it was ps2", "The stand itself is good. I also like the style, but it's not that easy. The stand is very simple. The fees placement is bad. I like it that it doesn't load with your standard charging space. It uses the place where you use your headphones, but it's kind of difficult in when the ps4 is already in place. If you have to do otherwise, it defeats the purpose of ease therefore you will stand up many times over time that you keep this v, took me a little fight to get the charger on it. I don't assume that the last time large product, works as it says and it's good for it to stand up (in my opinion), because the ground does not heat up.", "This game was delivered quite quickly, but I give it a four stars because it doesn't come with the original box and the disc had slight scratches on it. My son likes this game it plays all the time.", "So here's my two cents on this product.. I had previously a type pad for my ps3 had mechanical buttons like a keyboard essentially aka hard shell buttons u press on a letter enter.. however, this product has a soft rubber feel on the buttons.. it definitely takes some getting used to it because u can't tap as fast as u like on a phone for example. So u need to slow down alott. But it does a decent job at what it's supposed to do that faster and easier than with one in game keyboard like when u play a mmo like Final Fantasy 14 or when playing with the Internet on the ps4. It's a good product, but not worth the money in my eyes. There's been a waiting time to get this product, but I can see why. It's Pricity Nifty. The small button on the actual pad comes in handy when you type. Easy to use and install. I like that they have a headset jack on the pad so you can still connect the possibility of a pair.", "Product was excellent I recommend R-Rsales The controller plays extremely well! I look almost brand new! I recommend this seller!", "Does not work. Poor quality vable Very good quality, works well, great price, and shipped very quickly.", "Very easy to use and something I highly recommend to protect anyone who uses their system. I would recommend this product to anyone with a NEW 3DS XL. This is AMAZING when putting a screen cover on. The step-by-step helps you to keep the screen on with little to no bubbles at all. Value EVERY Cent. Thank you!! Perfect for both my children New Nintendo DS's! Love it! Hard to know it is there (must double check as soon as I took the protective layer). We have been on the DS's for over a month and there are no signs of peeling. Great for us! Fits perfectly and it does job.", "Helldivers is hellish fun!Serious, now, I can't think of a better co-op experience. The action is tense, the cards look cool, and the enemies are tough, without overwhelming, and even if they roll over you, the game never feels cheap. You can revive yourself as long as you're still able to crawl, a teammate can speed up the process, and when you die, your teammates can set a beacon that will revive you. There are a ton of upgrades to your weapons, special skills (which will revive the form of call in ammunition, special equipment, allies, etc.) and so on. There are two different vehicles your team can pile up in that are also armed. The missions make sense.Each way, this twin-stick cadre shooter gets everything right in the bottom. You don't want to play that. Maybe 19.99 best. Is boring quickly good! This is the most useful and it contains all DLC.", "I am very pleased with this purchase of a modified ps4 with 2 Tb memory. The seller delivered amazing customer service to support their product. The system came new with the updated finished with precision. The seller delivered images of the quality of the work and the product before shipping. The ps4 is connected and runs perfectly. The system came new with a controller, chat board, dual charging system, the last remastered by us, and the standard accessories for connecting the system.

I'm glad I bought it and am now playing again one of the most important games of my childhood.", "I should have read the reviews before I bought them. Same problem without connecting to my TV. Just an empty screen that says no signal. I'm able to connect the original NES just good with its cables.Don't buy DON if you want to play N64. It doesn't work. My son wasn't optimistic when I ordered this cable, but once he got it, he was overjoyed that it worked! Allows my old SNES to work. Yay! It works and that's all that matters!", "Simple installation looks great excelente", "The controller is in very good condition, but the start button must be pressed harder than the other buttons, that's the reason for the 4 star rating, I recommend this seller. Bring me back! item came fast and works great!", "Great gift idea It&#34;s perfedt!", "I bought four, so I could constantly have two in the controllers and two on the chargers. I'm glad that I. These things do not hold any kind of charge. They start giving the & #34;low battery& #34; signal within 20 minutes of switching off the charger, even if they have charged overnight.

So cool", ":) Another interesting piece for my collection!", "Is Gud Big Headset. Definitely worth buying.", "Get these the other day and one of the wheels had a piece chipped at the side.

The cartridge is near prefect condition and plays very well! everything with Mario is great It's a nice game", "A little hard to program, but once done works perfectly! It's my firmtime with a game controller for my phone to play and excited about it. But I have games that requires most of the button.

I have to admit: this is the only game I like to play with them!", "Sigh, I absolutely LOVE this game. I hate to wait for so long to play it. I had a hard time accepting that remedy was not this, but still..it is not a bad game at all. Now just hoping that I will be able to play it on my Xbox one day!!! Btw love the games soundtrack. I tend to make my Xbox one just to play it. Great game awesome story love the max Payne series", "Red Nunchuck, Japanese Import.Beautiful Element, I use it with my Mario Wiimote. It's a slightly darker red, but not noticeable.Works very good. Grandson enjoys boxing.", "For children bought but fun enough that I like to play it. This was surprisingly decent. For those who don't know this is a kind of port of a free to play mobile game on the 3DS. I say type of port because quite a lot has been changed. The biggest of it is the elimination of all micro-transactions and the nonsense that business model spawns. So things like timer, & #34;premium&#34; currency, and lottery machines are gone. That alone is a great improvement. However, on that they are also added to a basic story line to the game. It's nothing special, but it might be that little extra something to motivate you to continue with the game.As a bonus, there's a completely separate second game that it's included on the Mario universe. This seems easier though. The mechanics all seem easier to understand, and when you start the game, it recommends you start with this version when you're new.", "I have fought my whole life to learn chords, strum correctly, and really learn to play the guitar. Finally, this tool has helped me do just that. Within two weeks I can progress between about 8 different chords, my fingers are yellowed, and I can play parts to about 10 different songs (but small parts). This is an amazing way to learn to play the guitar for those who are musically rejected like me. This doesn't really work on my TV, you need to play special cables lagless", "Fits perfectly Fits perfectly I've tried to install a better battery in my PlayStation 4 controller when I accidentally broke the small bag that holds the trigger in place. I was a little worried about this as they are aftermarket triggers and not Sony, but they are 1-1 quality. I think there is another review that says that their noticeably a little cheaper or maybe a little looser, but that's just them paranoid. These are exactly the same and now that I'm replacing them in my controller for a few months I can't remember which one is broken.", "My 16 year old loves this case fits perfectly around my wii u gamepad. I bought two and placed one around the black and the other around the white gamepad. It looks nice on both and I really like that the case is like hard plastic. Also there are like small rubberized feet things to help on the bottom of the gamepad, keep it from moving when placed down. It also fits on the charger still. Cut all holes well align. Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. There was really some color to the controller and protects it as well. It's all I had hoped and more! It's so cute My guys love Splatoon, so this was perfect for them. However, they have to always remove it again to charge the game pad. Case is pretty rad, no damage and the colors are bright. It looks really good when you have a black Wii u pad. I plan to order another for my man since we both have our own Wii u pad and love the game. It's a case and not a sticker and it's very hard.", "I honestly loved this headset, it has nice sound quality like the expensive headsets.I would have given it a five-star rating if the wire was a bit thick, because as it is now, you feel like you can just pull it apart with a tug.", "Arrived in a great state, thank you. it's a nice game, I love Batman, I love dark knights, his awsome man", "Fail. The package says it does not work with LED or LCD TVs. What? Utter fail. Wasted money. ... does not work with modern TVs", "As a fan of some of the previous DMC games, I had high hopes for this. It seems like the story is interesting, but the controls specifically the jump mechanics kept me from enjoying this game by constantly repeating every single action with a jump with every kind of precision I haven't played DmC in a long time, but I've enjoyed the final edition.

It's good It came in perfect condition!", "great Good product! I bought this first for the handles. My hands, though not necessarily large, are cramped while playing for a long time. This was a great help!!! In addition, the additional battery on it, although I didn't really notice the increase in battery life as I usually have it off or charging if not in use.

I know the game is good because we played this year, but Power PC is not supported by newer Macs. This is the best biggest game I have ever met. I love it more than any kind of games on Earth, even the StarCraft II. But unfortunately it is no longer supported by modern Mac, the CPU is Intel. When I try to install it on my Mac, it says \"the PowerPC apps are no longer supported.\" It's bad for me. Does it mean that I'm playing it on a virtual machine after?", "My husband and son had arrived very satisfied in time, intact and as announced. No complaints. The code does not work I want a refund or replace I prefer Ghosts.", "These are good, but I did the CQC and this skirt! I don't play a lot of PS4 games, but I felt I needed some extra cushions and surface.Let me first note that I didn't realize how aggressive I can be with my controller, so that this check can be slightly biased.For beginners, they will easily pop out when I push at the edge, especially while playing with racing games. They got a lot of abuse during Rocket League. The more they burst out, the looser they got to the point I just stopped with them. This was very frustrating for them to pop out during an intense gaming session/scene/etc. The worst part is that the little tabs they would hold on the DS4 would catch their own rubber cushions. These things actually ruined my left sticks rubber padding. It created a Gash and it only got worse when it burst out. Unfortunately, for me, I noticed too late. It's one thing that didn't cost me anything, but it had to buy another thing ruining a new one.", "I was a little skeptical about buying this at the beginning, then when they came, I put them in my controller and I can't explain how beautiful they are! Definitely recommend about this standard plastic analog sticks, since these take MUCH longer to wear (if they ever decide to). Just what I noticed when I was first in the control when the shell was closed, the correct analog stick didn't want to move. That was easy by pressing a little harder on them to put in the controller properly, and everything was fine from there. If you are looking to replace old, worn out analog sticks, these make excellent replacement! I love it when you use them first for the day, you can feel the cold aluminum. They are pretty awesome and look good on my controller. I bought these thumb rods to try and fix a slight drifting problem I had on my left thumb and it worked.", "Good third person shooter like GTA This is such an addictive game!

I use this game as a reference guide to identify different forms of life in our oceans with teenagers and younger adults who did not have the opportunity to explore the oceans themselves. Of course, a video game is not a substitute for the real thing like going out exploring the world underwater. But it will be an additional teaching tool in the study of marine life with visualization, images and hand eye coordination.

Starting with the completion of a simple installation I immediately put on rubber grips in an attempt to reduce merchandise for the thumb sticks. Then went into a game, immediately finding that the hollow centers of the analog sticks did not have a proper depth, which in a massive amount of friction from the bottom of the rubber grip against the controller. I then tried to pull out the thumb sticks a little bit, just to find them went to the same position after clicking on the thumb stick down several times and when I pulled out the thumb sticks, in order to far would rub the friction from another part of the inside of the controller against the spherical part of the analog stick. End result, removing the rubber grips. 2) Melts time and level of wear-off - (short answer) I'll wear a serving quickly, but I don't have any reason to believe that they are used casually.", "Same s*** every year.

Madden gets better every year.", "It wasn't as immersive as I expected if you like a pure auto simulation game, then this is the game for you..You can spend hours setting your car with all the details. at the same time, if you're not familiar with car settings, you can still use the default settings and have fun.Graphics are amazing. from the car's detail to each track.as far as the game modes, you can have a career of 0 (Karts), and work your way to the big league, with teams that ask you to sign up for their team as you progress in the game.I didnt give this game a 5 stars because it has some errors (some quite large). I feel the game has been designed to be played with the wheel controller, but if you like me, which it plays with just the controller, it could be a little frustrating, if not impossible to play it directly from the box. the only solution to this problem is to google for the controller settings. you will choose many options where the right control works.", "Very handy, feels good in hand. But ITS FUNCTIONALITY SUCKS! You must literally be within 6 feet of Xbox and it has to point directly at it. Microsoft missed the mark with this. It's much easier to use Xbox Smart Glass on your phone. :( It's fine. Abnormally wide, and has to work directly on the device. Otherwise, it's a remote control. The XBOX 360 Remote was a better product than this. Easy to use the controller. Great device to play movies and Netflix instead of the game control. This remote control is extremely well done. The soft touch material is really attractive and the ergonomics of the remote control itself are on the spot. Range is better than my TV remote control by a long shot, and it has a great close proximity background light sensor that lights up the remote control when it feels that you are going to / have recorded it.

I had a slightly older version of this headset that was slightly different in layout, but it was almost identical. It broke after a year, and I glued it together.

WARNING: NO BUY THIS!! I ordered this as a gift for my son and when he opened it he was excited to play, but it didn't come with a controller and it had scratches everywhere. We were very disappointed. And when I returned it, they only put $140 in my bank account! I PAYED more than that!!! And now my son is sad and ive lost a lot of money.", "I did the red one before America knew it was cool. Amazing 10/10 5 weeks with the red controller and it still works well. I'm a casual-heavy gamer and I read a few good and bad reviews, and I have to say the problems that some people with their not happening with me. What for those who come up with the little rubber pieces on the analog stick peeling off, I highly recommend that you buy handles because my original black controller (which I somehow devastated the L3 button by pressing it WAY too hard) rubber parts never once showed ANY characters of peeling. I bought my handles from my local GameStop for about $2-$5 and they are pretty good for quality. If it had come 5 stars when it came with a charging cable.Oh and word of warning, this is a JPN PS4 controller and not a US PS4 controller.", "The big idea, but check what it has to do is not to get to with an Apple product. But it could be great with an Android or an apple if it would work. If I finally did it works... love it. Tactile answer is perfect, no input delay, and decades old muscle memory came back right away =) It's the little things that really make this so much fun. The thing just looks dead on... the same strange shade of gray, the red, the size, the feeling. The box came in looks like the old NES console that was fantastic. Also, the paper's instructions were printed on that strangely white out, so I'll keep the difficulty on getting it working as my own fault. Maybe my tips below will help. - Turn on your Android device and go to Bluetooth options.", "It came before time, it seems to work well, it looks like his picture. My grandson loves it! I would recommend this product.", "Two games at the price of 1 very entertaining I was so excited to play, but it doesn't work with the Wii U -", "Very good. I highly recommend it when saw-esque horror puzzle solve is your thing. The puzzles are almost certainly dooable by everyone at least in high school. The story is extremely appealing. Absolutely fantastic! Visually appealing graphics, appealing plot, soundtrack, plot spins, puzzles... All about this game is five-star. I bought this game for my daughter. She loves it I was so excited for this game-I love puzzles and character-based games. But that was really weak. I swear if I still hear a bit about the Titanic, or how everything is connected, or how to PAY together, I can just snap. I really don't understand the love-I shouldn't spend the first two hours of gameplay that I could play. As far as good things-I like the characters. And the art is very good.", "It fits very badly about the PSP, don't make it playable while the cover is on, it could be useful as a protective cover on trips or something, but nothing more than that. It has some problems when I order it: / I have to ask for a better one that is a shame oh good.", "I decided to spend a little more than twice the price for the Microsoft hard drive. Whenever you have an electronic device, I'm sure yours is better off. The reviews for the cheaper ones according to market those were mostly positive, I think in the long run better to pay only now and not later. And I'm sure that the xbox 360 will run better. That's my personal opinion. Works 100% as expected Good things came here when it should and worked as it should. Just plug in and started playing no formatting needed and recognized as it was from the factory."]}
