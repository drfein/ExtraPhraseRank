How are they supposed to live?\"\nShe added that she knew many people who had stopped buying meat- too expensive for those with a family to feed.\nMarch 2015: 16.9%\nFebruary 2015: 16.7%\nJanuary 2015: 15.0%\nDecember 2014: 11.4%\nNovember 2014: 9.1%\nOctober 2014: 8.3%\nYear-on-year figure\nBut the downturn does not necessarily translate into pressure on the Russian government from its own consumers.\nMany people seem to blame the West for all Russia's economic woes.\n\"It's sanctions that are behind it all,\" said a shopper outside one Moscow supermarket. \"After all, you are the enemy.\"\nAnd many Russian political analysts conclude that Western sanctions have, in fact, been counter-productive.\n\"Sanctions may have hurt the Russian economy,\" says Evgeny Minchenko, an independent political consultant who names the Kremlin among his clients.\n\"But politically they unite people against the West. Recent polls show the highest level of anti-Western feeling in recent history. It won't be easy to reverse.\"\nAt the Higher Economics School - an elite university set up in part to help formulate Russian economic policy - economists say that they are being ignored by a Kremlin inner circle which focuses on imagined enemies rather than economic realities.\n\"I cannot imagine a sane economist could be happy with what is going on,\" says prof Sonin.\n\"Economic decision-making is being done by those who work in the military and the security services.\n\"They invest a lot in military production, because at the top they feel that Nato is close to the walls of the Kremlin and Russia is under siege.\n\"I think they live in a pretty strange world. They live in an information bubble with their own monsters and nightmares - and the economy is not a major concern.\"\nKremlin consultant Evgeny Minchenko takes a different view.\nHe thinks the Kremlin is concerned about the economic downturn, but simply cannot find effective ways to counter it.\nHis reading is that the attempt to \"pivot\" to Asia has not yet compensated for the loss of Western business and credit lines; there is only a 20% chance of EU sanctions being lifted in the short-term and repairing relations with the West in the current climate looks unlikely.\nSo instead, the Kremlin is focusing on import substitution and other measures to try to make the internal market work better - by cracking down on corruption, and giving tax breaks to small and medium-sized enterprises.\nWhether it will work is another matter. Reports on a recent Cabinet meeting suggest President Putin was agitated and frustrated at the lack of young Russians willing to risk opening new businesses.\nIn theory, Dmitry Finikov is doing exactly what President Putin wants.\nHe has switched from importing to producing his own lower-quality, Russian-made guns and ammunition.\nBut it is only out of necessity, not choice.\nHe explains why small businessmen like him remain pessimistic.\n\"I used to plan for five years. Now I can only plan for two or three weeks. The Russian economy has been so globalised over the last 20 years, that it cannot survive like this.\n\"Sooner or later the oil price will go down again, then the rouble will drop again.\n\"For the moment we are eating into our reserves. But when they are used up, then the economy will drop immediately like it was in 1992.\n\"You remember: hyperinflation, people losing their jobs and not getting paid for six months or a year, and everyone going out to the suburbs to plant potatoes to feed themselves from the ground.\"\nThe prognosis of prof Sonin is less dramatic but still gloomy.\nHe compares Russia's likely future to that of many Latin American countries in the second half of the 20th Century:  a slight contraction, or growth so slow that it amounts to stagnation, lasting for 10 or even 20 years; and exit from the crisis only possible when the Russian government stops sacrificing the economy to foreign policy goals.\n\"I do not foresee the lifting of sanctions under the current regime. I think it will be the next government, maybe in 20 years, which will negotiate a solution.\"\nMeanwhile, farmer Maxim Chebanov has \"Napoleonic\" plans- to expand to more than a hundred cows and open a mini-dairy and farm shop.\nHe thinks the crisis will blow over.\n'We Russians have survived crises worse than this. And anyway it's all temporary.\n\"Sooner or later we'll have money again and foreign investment will return.\n\"And meantime while sanctions continue, the stronger we will become.\"\nHear Bridget on the Today programme here.", "Metropolitan Police officer Tom Harrison, from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, used the name Mr Gorilla during the challenge.\nAll sponsorship money would go to The Gorilla Organisation, he said.\nAfter crossing the finishing line he was congratulated by TV celebrity and conservationist  Bill Oddie.\nMr Harrison missed out on the marathon finishers' medal, awarded to runners who complete the course within eight hours, but was given a trophy and a stuffed gorilla toy.\nHe slept at friends' homes overnight and spent 10-12 hours most days covering the course.\nMr Harrison said it was difficult crawling on his knees and he eventually decided to walk on all fours - feet and hands.\n\"When people saw the marathon number on my back they realised what I was doing and support grew.\n\"People even stopped to cheer me,\" he said.", "Media watchdog Ofcom says more people will have faster broadband as a result of proposals to make BT's Openreach network more independent.\nOpenreach's cables and wires are used by more than 30 million customers in the UK.\nIts infrastructure is used not only by BT, but telephone and broadband providers such as Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone.\nIt's extremely frustrating watching the advertisements on TV showing super-fast access to fibre broadband at a much cheaper deal than I can get for poor quality standard broadband down a phone line.\nIts high time someone thought about us poor people living in rural locations and concentrated on our needs for better broadband speeds, as we need it as much as everyone in the town does.

So the failure to deliver fibre is also holding back the progress of the whole media industry - an industry which is, in all other aspects, world-class.\nMy broadband speed is at best 1.2mb, but apparently I'm \"lucky\" to get that, because I'm at the end of a 9km line from the exchange - even though I'm only 3km away as the crow flies. However, of course I am still paying the same monthly fee as people with much faster speeds.  The engineers have had to come out to repair faults on my line twice so far this year alone, and one took four months to resolve.\nI don't see why it should take over a week to get someone to sort out a fault when the water and electricity companies act immediately and work through the night if necessary.\nThere are 11 cabinets in Faringdon, Oxfordshire.

This week it was Vardy who stepped down, but he was not missed as others starred in what was the Foxes' best league performance of the season.\nThe hosts attacked with pace, with Musa, Okazaki and Mahrez in particular giving Palace problems. The opener by the lively Musa was deserved, with the Nigerian's manager saying the winger is now \"ready\" for the Premier League.\nOkazaki also caught the eye, doubling Leicester's advantage by drilling Damien Delaney's clearance in at the near post for his first goal in 14 appearances.\nFuchs' volley across goal was the icing on the cake, however, as the full-back - who extended his contract with the club this week - gave Steve Mandanda no hope in the Palace goal. \"I just hit it as hard as I could,\" said the Austrian.\nPalace manager Alan Pardew talked this week of creating a legacy at Selhurst Park, and specifically of qualifying for Europe, but back-to-back league defeats will knock confidence.\nYet there are positives for Pardew to take in defeat.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nHis team fought until the final whistle, ending the match with 23 shots - six more than Leicester - and edged their opponents in possession and territory.\nWilfried Zaha was bright throughout, assisting the returning Cabaye as he beat both Andy King and Fuchs on the right wing, but unfortunately for Palace Andros Townsend on the opposite wing had a quiet match.\nThe match could have unfolded differently had Christian Benteke's header hit the back of the net instead of the crossbar in the first half with the score goalless, but once the visitors fell two goals behind defeat seemed the only likely outcome as the Foxes thrived on the counter-attack.\nLeicester manager Claudio Ranieri: \"I feel good. For the first 20 minutes I felt not so good but after that we started to play our pressing, fast football against a very good team.\n\"That was our best performance so far this season. It was the shape and model of last season and we concentrated on doing our job. We knew our weaknesses but also strengths.\n\"This was not a game for Jamie Vardy just like last game was not a game for Riyad Mahrez. I want to rotate my players and now everybody is ready to fight for their place on the pitch.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nCrystal Palace boss Alan Pardew: \"The scoreline wasn't a fair reflection. We had a great start, hit the bar and that could have changed the course of the game.\n\"But then they cranked it up for the last 20 minutes of the first half and we struggled to hold on to them.\n\"The second half we had loads of chances but failed to capitalise. We were OK but their pace and power were too much for us at the end. They are champions for a reason.\"\nLeicester's next match will be at White Hart Lane against Tottenham on 29 October.

It said that more than 20 people \"of different nationalities\" had been killed but this has not been confirmed.\nSecurity forces say they are trying to negotiate the hostages' release.\nInitial reports said that as many as 20 foreigners were among those taken captive.\nSeven Italian nationals are believed to be in the cafe, the Italian ambassador in Dhaka, Mario Palma, was later quoted as saying by Italian media.\nA Japanese government spokesman said Tokyo was investigating reports that some of its citizens were among the hostages.\n\"We want to resolve this peacefully. We are trying to talk to the attackers,\" said Benazir Ahmed, chief of the Rapid Action Battalion, Bangladesh's elite police force.\n\"Our first priority is to save the lives of the people trapped inside.\"\nPolice said the gunmen burst into the Holey Artisan Bakery cafe at about 21:20 (13:20 GMT) and opened fire.\nThis is probably the first time ever foreigners have been taken hostages in Bangladesh.\nThough there have been a number of killings focusing on academics, activists and member of religious minorities, attacks on foreigners are rare.\nThe timing is important. Bangladesh has been gearing up for the Muslim religious festival of Eid, and most people have started going to their homes in villages and towns across the country for a week-long holiday period.\nThe government has always denied the presence of Islamic State militant group in Bangladesh.\nSo far the militants have targeted individuals and sometimes security forces. But storming a cafe in a heavily guarded diplomatic district is unprecedented and a dramatic escalation in violence.\nThe government has been caught unaware, and the attack exposes a big hole in Bangladesh's intelligence gathering and security system.\nThe cafe is described as being popular with expatriates, diplomats and middle-class families.\nMedia reports quoted witnesses as saying that \"Allahu Akbar\", meaning \"God is greatest\", was heard as the attack took place.\nAn eyewitness said she heard a loud noise, followed by continuous gunfire.\n\"The glass of my drawing room shattered,\" Rashila Rahim said.\n\"My auntie, her daughter and two friends went there for Iftar (breaking of the Ramadan fasting) and they have not come back. We cannot even check where they are.\"\nAnother local resident, Tarique Mir, said he could hear sporadic gunfire nearly three hours after the attack began.\n\"It is chaos out there. The streets are blocked. There are dozens of police commandos,\" he said.\nBBC South Asia editor Jill McGivering says that although high-profile gun attacks are rare in Bangladesh, the latest incident follows a series of murders widely blamed on Islamist extremists.", "She was speaking after a 15-year-old boy was charged with conspiracy in connection with an alleged terror plot in Australia.\nHe is one of the latest teenagers to be linked to activity by Islamist extremists around the world.\nLast month, reports said one of two girls who ran away from their home in Austria to join the so-called Islamic State in Syria had been beaten to death while trying to escape. She was 17.\nHer 15-year-old friend is believed to have been killed in fighting in 2014.\nWhile the majority of jihadists around the world are not teenagers, official figures show that their involvement in violent Islamism is growing.\nThe number of under-18s arrested for alleged terror offences in the UK almost doubled from eight to 15 from 2013-14 to 2014-15. The total number of arrests for all age groups was 315 - an increase of a third on the previous year.\nExperts say this bears out fears that more and more young people are being drawn to extremism, with followers in their early teens among them.\n\"We are seeing this kind of thing happening more and more with the rise of Islamic State,\" says Charlie Winter, an expert in jihadist militancy.\n\"And it is not something that is coming about by mistake.\"\nThe main target for groups like Islamic State is said to be young people between 16 and 24 years old.\nHowever the radicalisation process can start as early as 11 or 12, says Daniel Koehler, director of the German Institute on Radicalization and Deradicalization Studies (GIRDS).\nYounger members are less valuable in terms of potential to carry out terror operations, he says, but they are used to spread ideology and influence others.\nAnd they are easier to access. \"Adolescents and teenagers are indeed easier to impress and lure into relationships with recruiters.\"\nMuch of the recruiters' work is done online.\n\"The internet is essential\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6. IS produces an average of 30 to 40 high-quality videos per day in almost every language,\" says Mr Koehler.\n\"They have an estimated Twitter network of 30,000 to 40,000 accounts, and guides for carrying out jihad or how to join IS are easily available online.\"\nThey have also been shown to heavily rely on other social media platforms such as Ask.FM, which are visited by a large proportion of younger users.\nBut it is not just the volume of content which is driving membership.\n\"While the internet does play an important role, what is different with IS is that it is much more outward facing,\" says Mr Winter, a senior research associate at Georgia State University.\n\"There is more accessibility and more interaction.\"\nHe says one of the greatest draws for young followers is the promise of belonging to a collective.\n\"IS is really trying to push this idea of a counter culture. They have crafted this idea of state building, of democratic jihad.\"\nThis aspirational nature can appeal to some adolescents who have high ideals and ambitions but are frustrated by their families or societies.\nThe feeling of marginalisation also drives membership, says Mr Winter.\n\"Ideology is very important but it is also about how people feel about the society they live in.\n\"Real or perceived grievances in the hands of a recruiter can reach fever pitch.\"\nWhile the internet is certainly an important tool for recruiters, both direct, real-life contact with radical groups in their home countries is equally vital.\n\"What we have seen a lot of times is people being enlisted by friendship groups,\" says Mr Winter.\n\"It's not just online. For every individual it is as much about knowing someone who has been to fight.\"\nMembers who have fought in Syria are encouraged to share information as a way of bringing other people in.\nExperiences are whitewashed to hide the iniquities and hypocrisies of the group's mission.\nYoung people are particularly impressionable when they hear these stories, Mr Winter says.\nAnd the stories can be found in schools, friendship groups and communities as easily online for those that know where to look.\nMr Koehler says young people are more accustomed to seeing violence in the media than adults, and this plays a role in their growing involvement in violent Islamism.\n\"But in the end it is about personal backgrounds and trajectories combined with opportunities and situations,\" he says.\n\"It is about when and how you come across a certain ideology and group, and what you are currently looking for in your life.\"", "But how realistic are they?\nLast month it emerged that Volkswagen had installed software in some of its vehicles that would make its diesel engines cleaner when they sensed that the car was in a testing lab.\nIt meant that the vehicles emitted between 10 and 40 times more pollutants in real world driving conditions than they did in testing.\nBut motoring organisations commented that many vehicles, even without such software, would give very different results in the lab compared with on the road.\nWe asked independent testers from Emissions Analytics to put a couple of diesel-powered cars through their paces.\nWe chose a two litre Volkswagen, because it is the company at the centre of the scandal, and a 1.5 litre Ford Focus, which according to DVLA figures is the second most popular diesel car on Britain's roads today (after the VW Golf).\nWe are not suggesting that either of these cars is cheating in any way.\nThe test recreates the way people actually drive around town - often at low speeds and in traffic, but with the odd fast stretch.\nThe kit measures Nitrogen Oxide, often called NOx - one of the key pollutants from diesel engines. It also checked the fuel efficiency.\nEngines have to meet European emissions regulations based on when they were built. The VW Passat that was tested was a slightly older model, so it had to meet the less stringent Euro 5 requirements. The newer Ford Focus had to meet the tougher Euro 6 standards.\nIn the tests conducted for the BBC, the VW emitted 0.664g of NOx per km, which is a touch under four times the regulated limit of 0.18g under the Euro 5 rules.\nIt managed 41.7 miles per gallon in urban testing, which is close to its published urban fuel efficiency of 44.8 mpg.\nThe Ford emitted 0.422g of NOx per km, which is more than five times the regulated limit of 0.08g under the Euro 6 rules.\nIt managed 47 miles per gallon in urban testing - well below its published urban fuel efficiency of 65.7 mpg.\nSo our cars were four or five times over emissions limits. The cars equipped with so-called defeat devices in America were as much as 40 times over.\nBut it turns out our results were very much in line with what the testers would have predicted.\n\"On average cars are polluting four times more than you should expect,\" says Jane Thomas from Emissions Analytics.\n\"The older cars are worse, the newer diesel engines are doing better. We've found four out of 60 so far that have met their official figures.\"\nSo why the big difference? Cars are not required to pass tests on a real road, but are tested in a lab.\n\"When you're driving on the road you're having to go up and down hills, you're travelling around corners, you're accelerating hard - all these things burn fuel,\" says Paul Wilkinson from the CSA automotive testing lab.\n\"When you're in the lab you're driving down a perfectly flat, smooth road. You don't need any air con on, you don't need any lights or wipers or anything like that. There are no hills and you have to accelerate quite slowly because that's what's in the regulations.\"\nThe EU plans to introduce more realistic, real road testing in the next few years, but for now carmakers only have to meet lab test requirements.\nVW chose not to respond to our results.\nFord did reply, saying that their emissions tests are \"fully in line with regulations\".\nAnd the company stressed that the Focus, like all Ford vehicles, \"does not have a so-called defeat device\".\nIt also says it supports the plans to introduce real road testing across Europe.", "Lindsay Jo Rimer, 13, disappeared on 7 November 1994 when she went to buy cornflakes from a shop in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire.\nHer body was found a mile from the town centre in Rochdale Canal the following April.\nA 68-year-old man from Bradford was arrested by police on Tuesday morning.\nMore stories from Yorkshire here\nHe was released earlier.\nA 63-year-old man arrested in November on the suspicion of Lindsay's murder remains on police bail.\nLindsay's body was found by two canal workers who were checking the water for debris.\nOne of them was Andy Glover, from Mytholmroyd, who said at first sight he thought it was a sheep but then realised it was the missing teenager.\nOn the day Lindsay was last seen, she left her home in Cambridge Street at about 22:00 GMT and met her mother at the Trades Club in Hebden Bridge.\nThe last known sighting of her was captured on CCTV 20 minutes later as she bought cornflakes on Crown Street.\nIn April, police said a new DNA profile had been identified which it hoped would lead them to identify the killer.", "Almost every politician, expert and commentator have been clear on one thing: Islamic State is not a state. Islamic State, they say, is a terrorist organisation.\nIt seems clear enough. IS militants have beheaded people on video. They have ransacked towns and villages. They have killed or threatened to kill anyone who dissents from their view of Islam. They have stolen territory from Iraq and Syria. There is no question of them gaining UN membership, or being accepted by any other international organisation.\nThus, US planes can bomb IS militants without breaking one of the cardinal principles of international law, as outlined in the UN Charter: \"All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.\"\nThere is, however, a problem with the action taken against IS. It is hard to drop bombs on a piece of land without someone accusing you of attacking their \"territorial integrity or political independence\".\nGet UN membership The ultimate goal for aspirant states - they need the support of the Security Council, then two-thirds of the General Assembly\nGet recognition If they fail at the UN, aspirant states can get recognition from as many other states as possible and function as a de facto state\nStart trading If they have few friends, aspirant states can just start making business deals - political recognition may follow, or it may no longer be needed\nIn Iraq, the current government formally requested help to battle IS. This makes a strong case for bombing IS in Iraq to be both legal and politically defensible.\nNo such get-out exists in Syria. Bashar al-Assad remains the president of Syria, and Syria remains a sovereign state. Mr Assad has not asked for help, nor has he consented to air strikes.\nDespite this, US President Barack Obama recently said: \"We have communicated to the Syrian regime that when we operate going after Isil [Islamic State] in their air space, that they would be well-advised not to take us on.\n\"But beyond that, there's no expectation that we are going to in some ways enter an alliance with Assad. He is not credible in that country.\"\nSyria enjoys all the formal trappings of statehood. But the US and its allies do not believe its government has legitimacy. That is enough for its most essential sovereign rights to be overrun, for it to be practically rendered a non-state. Western European states including the UK have not taken part in the bombing of targets in Syria, even though they are part of the anti-IS coalition.\nIt is possible to say that there are three different concepts of statehood in this story:\nIslamic State's claims have no support among states, but they illustrate that there is no universally accepted definition of statehood. Put the question \"What is a state?\" to a politician, a lawyer, a sociologist and an economist and you would get four different answers.\nKosovo: Declared independence from Serbia in 2008 after a period of UN administration; recognised by more than 100 states; path to UN membership blocked by Russia\nPalestinian territories: Declared independent by PLO in 1988; currently represented at the UN as a \"non-member observer state\"; recognised by more than 100 other states but not Security Council members UK, US or France\nAbkhazia: Broke away from Georgia in 1999; recognised by Russia and three other states; dependent on Russia for economic support\nSomalia: Full UN member, wide recognition, but no functioning central government; large areas are governed autonomously\nIn law, for example, an attempt was made in the 1930s to distil the meaning of statehood in a single treaty - the Montevideo Convention. It lists four qualities a state must have:\nCrucially, it also attempts to shackle politicians to the law by stipulating: \"The political existence of the state is independent of recognition by the other states.\"\nThere is little in the Montevideo Convention that would clearly deny statehood to IS, or any other violent group capable of seizing territory and subjugating a population. The Convention has no moral dimension.\nBut IS, as outlined above, is not regarded as a state. How can it be denied recognition? Not by appealing to any legal rule, but by invoking the moral imperative that violence and terror cannot be rewarded. Politics provides the morality - and subjectivity - that the law lacks.\nHowever, the moral dimension is by no means universal.\nNorth Korea, to take just one example, is a state that imprisons many thousands for suspected disloyalty, frequently threatens nuclear war and allows millions to starve through famine. Yet US diplomats rub shoulders with North Korean colleagues in the corridors of power from New York to Geneva. For all practical purposes, North Korea is a state.\nConversely, Taiwan has enjoyed three decades of prosperity under elected governments adhering to international treaties and generally respecting the rights of its citizens. Yet Taiwan is not a UN member and is recognised only by a handful of states. It is euphemistically referred to as \"the island\". In sporting events it cannot even use the name Taiwan.\nFor every example, there is an equal and opposite counter-example. Rather than a harmonious international society with defined rules of membership, we seem to exist amid a jumble of entities that fulfil ever-shifting entry standards with varying levels of success.\nThe military battle against IS is messy, deadly and terrifying for those directly affected. The battle for ideas is genteel by comparison, but it has largely expunged the myth of a universal idea of statehood. The consequences of that are likely to be felt for generations to come.", "The 74-year-old was hit by a hydraulic metal door on the Pinewood set of the Millennium Falcon in June 2014.\nFoodles Production (UK) Ltd, a subsidiary of Disney, admitted two of four criminal charges at Milton Keynes Magistrates' Court.\nThe company will be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 22 August.\nThe other two charges were withdrawn.\nRead live updates on this story\nProsecuting, Andrew Marshall told the court Ford had gone through the door on the set of Star Wars Episode Seven: The Force Awakens and hit a button before starting to walk back through it, believing the set was not live and that it would not close.\nBut it was remotely operated by another person, and as Ford passed underneath it, he was hit in the pelvic area and pinned to the ground.\nMr Marshall said there was a \"risk of death\".\n\"It could have killed somebody.

They used a CT Scanner and X-ray machine, that would normally be used on children, to see beneath the wrappings without damaging the ancient specimens inside.\nThe team scanned a variety of different types of animal mummies from wading birds and falcons to cats and shrews and even a five foot long Nile crocodile.\nThe team got a surprise when they discovered that a crocodile shaped mummy contained not just one crocodile but eight baby crocs carefully wrapped together.\nThe scanning wasn't easy to film as each delicate mummy needed to be handled as little as possible and we stopped filming as soon as an emergency human patient needed to use the scanner (which happened a few times).\nBut the final scan the team did was perhaps the most interesting. The outside of the mummy was shaped like a cat, with tiny ears and a nose, but the scans revealed something that had remained hidden since it was made thousands of years ago, only a few pieces of cat bone were inside the wrappings.\nLidija explained around a third of the animal mummies she scanned contained partial remains or even looked completely empty.\nThe reason why is hotly debated, some experts suggest animal mummies were being made to be sold to Egyptian pilgrims and so the ancient embalmers could make more profit by selling \"fake\" mummies, others like Lidija believe its evidence the ancient embalmers considered even the smallest parts of the animals to be sacred to went to just as much efforts to mummify them correctly.\nAs well as our UK filming, we travelled to Egypt to visit the ancient underground tombs where many of these animal mummies were found.\nSaqqara is an ancient Egyptian temple complex around an hour's drive from Cairo where millions of animal mummies are still buried.\nWe filmed molecular biologist Sally Wasef from Griffith University, Australia as she clambered down a narrow twelve metre deep shaft into an underground catacomb filled with the ancient mummified remains of wading birds called Ibis.\nSally collected samples of bones from the mummies so she could extract and compare their DNA, helping her to understand whether they had been intensively farmed.\nWe also followed Dr Paul Nicholson from Cardiff University, who's been mapping and excavating the Saqqara site for over 20 years.\nPaul took us deep under the desert to explore a network of tombs where up to eight million mummified dogs had been buried.\nEgyptologist Professor Salima Ikram from the American University in Cairo has studied these mummified dogs and showed us how their bones contained evidence they were bred and then killed to be mummified.\nIn fact at one time, animal mummification was such a massive industry in Ancient Egypt that animals were intensively bred in their millions to satisfy what had become a national obsession with animal mummification.\nHorizon - 70 Million Animal Mummies: Egypt's Dark Secret, will air on BBC 2 on Monday 11 May at 2100.", "Australia survived seven minutes with 13 players without conceding a point.\nThe result means the Wallabies advance to face Scotland in the quarter-finals and Wales take on South Africa.\n\"I felt we needed a try. We were six points behind so it would have needed two penalties to get us level and they were two players down,\" said Warburton.\n\"I think any country would have backed themselves to get over. But Australia's defence was fantastic and sometimes you just have to put your hand up and say 'well done'.\n\"We threw everything at them and I can sit here and say I don't have any regrets.\"\nWarburton also praised the defence of Stephen Moore's team as Wales suffered an 11th consecutive defeat by the Wallabies.\nWarren Gatland's team won 12-6 the last time they played the Springboks and were beaten by a last-minute penalty try in Nelspruit in the summer of 2014.\nWarburton thinks Wales can overcome the South Africans and reach a second consecutive World Cup semi-final.\n\"We are already looking forward to that quarter-final - it's against a team we've beaten in the last 12 months,\" he said.\n\"And there's one thing our players don't mind it's a challenge and we've proved we can do it in the past.\n\"I'm disappointed we lost today, but I'll definitely back ourselves next week.\"\nMany doubted Wales would advance from the toughest of all the tournament's pools, which included four teams ranked in the world's top 10.\nBut victory over England in the second game proved decisive and Warburton feels the win in Twickenham proves they have the players for the big occasion.\n\"We've had three huge games and I think the players we've got a lot of guys with a lot of caps who are used to dealing with big games,\" added Warburton.\n\"Playing these big games in these big stadiums is an absolute privilege. It doesn't faze us, we embrace it.\"\nWales coach Gatland also highlighted the Wallabies' \"courageous\" defence as a decisive factor.\n\"They were throwing their bodies on the line,\" said Gatland. \"We got over the line three times and been held up.\n\"To me it was just really fine margins. If Dan Biggar kicks that penalty on half-time you're 12-9 down rather than 12-6 down - your mindset changes and you take the three points.\n\"We did a great job defensively.

They played it really poorly, because it looked to me as if they had not worked on it very much.\nSouthampton quickly worked out how to capitalise on their weaknesses and, by the time Leicester changed their shape at half-time, they were 2-0 down and as good as out of the game.\nThat tactical effect is not always so obvious when I watch Premier League matches.\nA lot of the time both teams are playing a similar way, or both are well organised and working hard - and it is moment of quality that wins the game.\nOn Sunday, Saints were much better tactically and they won the match because of it.\nI never played regularly in a diamond at any of my clubs, but we used it at certain times when I was at Liverpool and it worked quite nicely for us.\nIn particular, we did it a few times when we played Manchester United at home because we felt their strength was in central areas, trying to play through us.\nUsing the diamond forced them wide and they put crosses in, which was what we wanted them to do.\nIt also meant we could press them higher up the pitch because the two strikers would be backed up by the man at the point of the diamond.\nIt tends to suit teams who have the majority of possession and play a lot of football because you have got four men in the centre of midfield and, although you are lacking in the wide areas, you should have at least one extra man in the middle. That is the theory anyway.\nWhat actually happened with Leicester was they did not try to play out from the back and keep hold of the ball to use that extra man.\nAnd, when they lost the ball, the guys who were in the diamond were crossing positions too much because they were not sure when to look for the ball in middle or when to go and try to win it out wide.\nIt is a difficult system to master, especially when you have not got possession.\nI am not against it, because I have played in it when it has worked, but it does not stretch the pitch as much as other formations and you do feel like you are doing extra work.\nI played as the wide man in a diamond a few times in my career and it is one of the hardest jobs a player can be asked to do.\nIt involves a heck of a lot of running, because you are kind of playing in centre midfield, then you are playing right midfield - then right-back and on the right wing.\nYou have to know when to go and chase the ball and when to sit and, on Sunday, Leicester's Danny Drinkwater, for example, struggled to get that right.\nWe know Danny is a very good central midfielder - he was one of the best in the Premier League last season.\nHowever, he was on the right of the diamond against Saints and was not used to that position, which let Saints left-back Ryan Bertrand really enjoy himself in the first half.\nSometimes Drinkwater was reacting to Saints attacks down his wing too late because he was too narrow and he could not get out to Bertrand in time, or he went out wide too early and left a gap inside.\nHe was not the only Leicester player to be caught between two places where they were meant to be and Saints utilised all this space really well because they kept switching play.\nThat left the two Leicester full-backs isolated a lot of the time and Southampton were getting a lot of crosses into their box - they scored their first goal from one of them.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nI saw a lot of the Leicester players question each other during that first half and get angry about who was marking who and where they were supposed to be.\nSo Ranieri was right to come out afterwards and acknowledge the way they started the game was his fault because he had tried something new.\nThe players will always take some of the responsibility because they are out on the pitch, but asking them to work on a system for a few days then go away to a good side like Southampton is a bit too much to ask.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nCompare that performance to the way Leicester were playing last season when all their players looked so comfortable playing 4-4-1-1 because they all knew their jobs. They had little partnerships all over the pitch, and it was perfect in so many ways.\nThings are different now. They have brought in some new players and are trying to adapt a little bit and they also have to deal with teams raising their game against them because they are the champions.\nThe expectancy level has gone up and, maybe because they have had a bad run, they have changed things too much instead of sticking to what they know.\nThat is not a criticism of Leicester, because every club wants to evolve and improve their squad with better players . When you do that, you want to keep the ball a bit more and play in different ways.\nBut it did not work out for them last week when they switched to play with three at the back in their defeat by Chelsea either.\nThe sooner they get back to a settled formation, the sooner their results will pick up. I don't think we will see that diamond again any time soon, though.\nSometimes it is not the fact you lose a game that hurts you, it is the way you lose it.\nLeicester's players will watch a recording of that Southampton game at some point this week and there are not many positives for them to take from it, even in the second half.\nThe league table does not look too good for the Foxes either - and their away form has been terrible all season.\nThey need to pick themselves up quickly, but I still look at the attacking quality they have in their squad compared to the other teams down at the bottom and think they can go on a run and climb the table.\nWill they go down? You can never say never, but I would be shocked if they got sucked into the bottom three.\nDanny Murphy was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.", "He left the home of the convicted tax fraudster after two hours, at 03:45 (01:45 GMT), the Kremlin confirmed.\nThe two enjoyed good personal relations while Berlusconi was in power.\nMr Putin, 62, had already raised eyebrows by missing a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday, the first day of the summit.\nHe was in the Serbian capital Belgrade as guest of honour at a military parade to mark the city's liberation from Nazi Germany 70 years ago.\nThe talks with Mrs Merkel, which focused on the peace process in Ukraine, eventually started four hours late, Russian media report.\nCorrespondents say Mr Putin has a reputation for arriving late.

The target is 95%.\nThen, last week, data for the start of the new year showed the proportion had dropped to a new weekly low of 86.7%.\nThe figures include walk-in centres and minor injury units. Once you strip them out, just one in seven major A&E units are hitting the target.\nData from NHS England shows there were over 14.6m visits to A&E in 2014 - an increase of 446,049 on 2013.\nDr Clifford Mann, the president of the College of Emergency Medicine, told the committee: \"Now the interesting thing about that is many people would describe that as only a 3% increase in attendances.\n\"That's certainly true, but the other way of describing it is to say that's equivalent to eight or nine extra emergency departments and of course we haven't built or staffed eight or nine extra emergency departments in the last 12 months.\"\nOther parts of the UK are also missing the four-hour target with waits in Northern Ireland and Wales even worse than in England.\nThe four-hour target measures the point from when the patient arrives to when they are treated and discharged, admitted to hospital or transferred to another part of the NHS.\nProf Chris Ham, from The King's Fund health think tank, said there was no simple explanation for the extra pressures on A&E.\nHe said: \"The causes are many, varied and complex. We think the most important causes are outside hospital.\"\nHe cited under-investment in GP services and a lack of community services to support people being discharged from hospital.\nDr Mann said it was not the fault of patients, who were often told to go to A&E, including through the helpline service, NHS 111.\nHe said: \"I don't think you should blame people for attending an emergency department when we've told them to go there, it's absurd.\"\nThe pressures being felt in A&E are also affecting other parts of the hospital system.\nThe Government has made much of the \u00c2\u00a3700m of extra funding made available to the NHS in England to cope with winter pressures. But has it all reached the frontline?\nDoubt was cast on that by Dr Cliff Mann of the College of Emergency Medicine. He told MPs that investment of the money was \"geographically patchy\".\nChris Ham of the King's Fund ventured that some of the money might be \"papering over the cracks\" of trusts struggling with deficits.\nDale Bywater of the Trust Development Authority argued that the money had been pledged early and was being closely tracked through the system.\nJust how the extra cash for the NHS has been used will continue to be an issue as the debate over the intense pressures on A&E continues.\nDelays are also being seen when ambulances hand over patients and inside the hospital when patients need to be found beds and when they are ready to be discharged.\nThe problems have even led to a number of hospitals declaring major incidents, which means they take steps such as calling in extra staff and cancelling routine operations, such as knee and hip operations.\nThe committee heard that pressures on A&E would have a knock-on effect on the rest of the health service as priorities shifted to target the four-hour wait.\nProf Ham warned other targets were likely to slip later in the year.\nProf Keith Willett, the director of acute care for NHS England, said: \"We have to do a transformation of the whole system with a particular focus on out-of-hospital services being the way to both reduce demand and also alleviate the issues of congestion within the hospital.\n\"It isn't going to be a quick fix. We have said it will be three to five years to get all of these things in place.\"", "Ruth Davidson said the UK remained one of the world's great liberal democracies.\nBut she said that reputation was being tested - with the world watching to see how the country conducts itself in the future.\nMs Davidson campaigned for a Remain vote ahead of June's EU referendum.\nBut in a speech to business figures at the Institute of Directors in London, she called on both Leave and Remain supporters to treat each other with respect.\nAnd she warned against giving way to a \"nasty vision of a backward-looking, introspective Britain\", and said the country should instead \"choose the path of openness and engagement\".\nMs Davidson said: \"Our decision to leave the European Union hasn't determined which path we'll take.

This is thought of as using fresh embryos.\nHowever, about one in five cycles of IVF in the UK uses frozen embryos - these were \"spare\" embryos kept from a previous IVF attempt.\nThere have been concerns that freezing may pose a health risk. However, the latest analysis, which is also published in the journal Fertility and Sterility, suggests that freezing may have better results.\nIt reported a lower chance of haemorrhage, premature birth and deaths in the first few weeks of life.\nLead researcher Dr Abha Maheshwari, from the University of Aberdeen, said: \"Our results question whether one should consider freezing all embryos and transfer them at a later date rather than transferring fresh embryos.\"\nShe told the BBC more research was needed and that it was \"a controversial topic\".\n\"It is a debate we should be having now,\" she added. \"It needs further exploration about what we do in the future.\"\nWhy frozen embryos might have better results is unknown and the researchers acknowledge the results are \"counter-intuitive\".\nOne theory is that stimulating the ovaries to release more eggs, as part of normal IVF, may affect the ability of the womb to accept an embryo. Freezing the embryo until later would allow it to be implanted in a more \"natural\" womb.\nHowever, data from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority says that in 2010 frozen embryos were less likely to result in pregnancy. There was a 23% success rate for frozen and a 33% chance for fresh embryos.\nDr Maheshwari argues that new techniques in the past few years have greatly increased the success rate.\nHowever Prof Alison Murdoch, the head of the Newcastle Fertility Centre at Life, Newcastle University, said: \"It is of some concern that conclusions have been drawn, incorrectly, that we should routinely freeze all embryos and transfer them in a future menstrual cycle.\n\"There is ample evidence to show that this would result in fewer pregnancies even if the outcome for those pregnancies were better.\"\nThe director of IVF at Hammersmith Hospital in London, Stuart Lavery, said it would be \"incorrect to conclude from these findings that we should stop performing fresh transfers and freeze all embryos\".\nHowever Mr Lavery said it provided reassurance that frozen embryos were as safe as fresh ones.\nIt was a view shared by Dr Allan Pacey, the chairman of the British Fertility Society and a researcher at the University of Sheffield.\nHe said: \"I think this is interesting because some people are nervous about frozen embryos and there have been various headlines about this study or that which suggest that frozen embryos may be a worry.\n\"What's really useful is that it shows that from the point of view of the woman's health during labour, and some early measures of the baby's health, frozen embryos do all right and are arguably better.\"", "Most of the 158 seats have been filled with just 10 left to be allocated.\nSo far, Fine Gael remains the largest party with 47 seats -

That's up from just 57% in 2009.\nAnd many financial technology start-ups are building new businesses on the back of the three major cloud platform providers - Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.\nFor example, Dutch-based tech start-up Ohpen has built a \"software-as-a-service\" product to allow firms to administer investment funds and savings accounts, with AWS handling all the data in the background.\nAnd Norwegian firm Auka has developed the first mobile payments platform run entirely on Google Cloud.\nMeanwhile, customer relationship management specialist Salesforce now allows banks to offer personalised financial advice on any device.\nThe advantage of such off-the-shelf products is that firms can easily plug into them, and begin offering financial services quickly and without huge capital investment.\nAnd cost is the number one reason for tapping into the cloud.\n\"There's a 20 cents in the dollar saving by moving data to the cloud,\" says Dave Richards, chief executive of global big data specialist, Wandisco.\n\"Building your own data centre is difficult - it can take one or two years if you need thousands of servers.\nMore Cloud Computing features from Technology of Business\n\"But if you use a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services you can have 1,000 servers at your disposal in about 30 minutes.\"\nFor big institutions, that's a huge potential saving in time and money, with a big chunk of IT responsibilities outsourced to a specialist provider.\nTesco Bank's head of transformation, Allan Brearley, says: \"The adoption of cloud technology allows us to respond to the needs of our customers more quickly and efficiently, while also offering the security standards our customers and regulators rightly expect from a financial services provider.\"\nThe potential cost savings became apparent very quickly for the bank.\n\"When we evaluated the solutions for a new [web] page using our traditional on-premise delivery model, it was going to cost about \u00a33,500 and take around three months to deliver,\" he says.\n\"However, we evaluated the AWS option using exactly the same design solution and it cost \u00a366 a month and took less than a week. We later realised we could just host these things as a static page costing 13p a month.\"\nAnother advantage of the cloud is that it is flexible - you generally just pay for the storage and services you use for a monthly subscription - cutting out waste.\nFor example, accounting software firm Sage offers small and medium-sized businesses access to real-time business data on all devices - including the Apple Watch - and starts at just \u00a330 a month. Xero operates a similar model for its cloud-based accounting software.\nAnd Salesforce's wealth management platform for banks and advisers costs from $150 (\u00a3106) a month.\nWith ready-to-go cloud-based solutions, you can be up-and-running within a matter of months or, in some cases, minutes.\nAuka claims its cloud-based mobile payments platform for retail banks can be ready to launch within three months.\nLess complex services, like accounting or sales management software, can be available to customers much faster.\nKlaus Michael Vogelburg, chief technology officer at Sage, says: \"Small companies can start using our software within minutes, and the longest any company would wait to get started is a matter of days.\"\nNot all financial companies are ready to fully embrace the cloud, though - just 1% of banks are running core processing in the cloud today, the Temenos research shows.\n\"There is a perception that there must be some compromise on security given the cost savings. But this is simply not the case,\" says Ben Robinson, chief strategy and marketing director at Temenos.\n\"Cloud platform providers such as Amazon and Microsoft clearly have more money to spend on security than smaller or even medium-sized financial services companies.\n\"They also remove the need for human involvement, which is the cause of 70% of banking fraud.\"\nBut concerns about security linger on.\nBob O'Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research, says: \"The cautious nature of the banking sector has definitely slowed its adoption of cloud-based services such as data storage.\n\"In the past, there have also been some security challenges that have played to their fears, which remain despite big efforts on the data security front.\"\nMr Vogelburg, meanwhile, expects more financial services companies to take up cloud-based services as the benefits to their customers become clear.\n\"The aim of any new technology should always be to improve the customer experience,\" he says.\n\"We are already doing that, but this is just the tip of the iceberg.

These dates were the two most recent passes of the European Union's Sentinel-1 satellites. Their radar vision is keeping up a constant watch as the White Continent moves into the darkness of deep winter.\nAfter some initial activity at the beginning of the year, the Larsen crack became stationary as it entered what is termed a \"suture\" zone - a region of soft, flexible ice. But this situation held only until the beginning of May, when the rift tip then suddenly forked. And it is the new branch that has now extended and turned towards the ocean.\nWhen the berg's calving does finally take place, the block will probably drift away quite gradually from the ice shelf.\n\"It's unlikely to be fast because the Weddell Sea is full of sea-ice, but it'll certainly be faster than the last few months of gradual parting. It will depend on the currents and winds,\" explained Prof Luckman.\nTaking out such a large chunk of ice would mean the Larsen C shelf would lose more than 10% of its area. Previous research by the Swansea group has shown that this will put the shelf in a much less stable configuration.\nSimilar calving events on the more northerly Larsen A and Larsen B ice shelves eventually led to their total break-up.

such as the collapse of London Underground maintenance firm Metronet in 2008.\nIn a critical report, the cross-party Treasury select committee said the long-term expense of PFI deals - where the private sector shoulders the upfront cost and is typically repaid by the taxpayer over a 30-year period - were now much higher than more conventional forms of borrowing.\nDue to the financing costs involved, it said paying off a \u00a31bn debt incurred through PFI cost the taxpayer equivalent to a direct government debt of \u00a31.7bn.\nPFI had become the default option for many public bodies as initial procurement costs were comparatively low, the MPs said, but too often the size of the financial commitments undertaken and their impact on future budgets was not taken into account at the time.\n\"We believe that a financial model that routinely finds in favour of the PFI route, after the significant increases in finance costs in the wake of the financial crisis is unlikely to be fundamentally sound,\" the report concluded.\n\"We do not believe that PFI can be relied upon to provide good value for money without substantial reform.\"\nThe report found little evidence that PFI-funded buildings were of higher quality or more innovative in their design than those procured by other means or that contractors were incentivised to maintain finished buildings to a higher standard.\n\"PFI means getting something now and paying later,\" Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP who chairs the committee, said.\n\"Any Whitehall department could be excused for becoming addicted to that.

On average, candidates scored just 24.8 out of a possible 60 marks in the first paper and 32.1 out of 70 in the second.\nEvery year, the marks needed to pass or achieve a particular grade are adjusted up or down to ensure consistency.

But in the Ashkenazi Jewish population the figure reaches one in 40.\nThe research team, based at University College London and the University of Manchester, compared the effectiveness of screening all Ashkenazi Jews with just screening those who were identified as being at risk because of their family history.\nThey showed that 56% of those carrying a mutation would not have had a test for BRCA based on family history alone.\nThe findings, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, show extra screening could save lives and money.\nThere are an estimated 114,400 Ashkenazi Jewish women in the UK.\nA separate analysis showed screening all of them over the age of 30 would lead to \"a reduction in ovarian cancer and breast cancer by 276 and 508 cases, respectively, at a discounted cost savings of \u00c2\u00a33.7m.\"\nProf Ian Jacobs, one of the researchers at the University of Manchester, said: \"For the Ashkenazi Jewish community specifically, this suggests that population testing for BRCA1/2 mutations could save lives.\"\nHe told the BBC: \"This can save lives and money, why wouldn't the NHS want to do something that could achieve both objectives.\n\"But the NHS does need to do its own proper evaluation.\"\nThe cost of this kind of screening, both for BRCA and other risk genes, is plummeting.\nThe NHS will eventually have to deal with questions about screening the whole population.\n\"No-one is suggesting we test the entire UK population for BRCA right now,\" Prof Ian Jacobs told the BBC.\nHe added: \"Broadly I think we need to do a lot more research on the consequences, good and bad, of this sort of testing in broader populations.\nThe costs of course would be much higher because the prevalence of the mutations is much lower.\"\nAthena Lamnisos, from The Eve Appeal which funded the trial, said: \"Women at increased risk of cancer deserve far more than today's genetic screening process gives them.\n\"This study shows that broadening

It felt like they were more supportive rather than it being a battle,\" she said.\nEmbryos, like sperm and eggs, can be stored for a maximum of 10 years before couples must renew their written consent.\nThe couple had already had two unsuccessful cycles of IVF on the NHS, and were about to undergo their third when Mr Jefferies, a former army medic, died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage in 2014 aged 51.\nMrs Jefferies was then told the embryos must be destroyed because a two-year storage period had expired.\nThis was despite the couple signing consent forms for 10 years' storage and posthumous use of embryos.\nThe court heard the forms had been amended because the couple had only two years of NHS funding, which has now expired.\nMrs Jefferies says neither she nor her husband signed the amendments and cannot remember how the changes were made.\nHer legal team suggest the changes on the forms reflect the clinic's policy at the time, which was to offer storage only for the period for which they were guaranteed payment and the law states that embryos cannot legally be stored once consent has expired.\nJudge Munby said the case \"turned on a signature\".\nThe clinic - Sussex Downs Fertility Centre - has since changed its policy and supported Mrs Jefferies' application.\nIt said its previous policy had not been driven purely by financial concerns, but also because of the desire to maintain regular contact with couples. It has also paid Mrs Jefferies' legal costs.\nClive Jefferies served in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was on board the transport ship Sir Galahad when it was bombed in the Falklands in 1982, killing 48 men.\nHe later worked as a nurse.\nIn early 2015 Mrs Jefferies received a letter from the clinic saying that consent for the embryo storage would expire that August.\nThe law states that embryos cannot legally be stored once consent has expired.\nBut Mrs Jeffries said she did not want to be denied the last chance to have her late husband's child by \"bureaucracy\".\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme before the judgement was announced: \"It's pure red tape.

But how far do the new measures go, who is monitoring them and what reassurance do they really offer?\nIn a long metal shed, hundreds of light brown mink dart around within rows of wire cages. It's really quiet - only the occasional squeak can be heard.\nThe fate of these animals is ultimately the same as any other farmed mink. At six months old, they will be gassed and their pelts sent to auction.\nBut for now, these ones are being studied by researchers working on new animal welfare assessments for the fur industry.\nThe mink are kept at a fur farm belonging to Aarhus University in Denmark.  The senior scientist, Steen Moller, showed me around one of the sheds.\n\"Like all other farm animals, they are kept in a confined space, so what we need to investigate is how do we provide the best environment for them,\" he says.\nThe cages contain shelves, straw and \"toys\" (plastic tubes), which are enrichments required by Danish law. Legal requirements vary from country to country, but Mr Moller is working on a common set of welfare assessment measures which can be applied to all European fur farms that sign up to be inspected.\n\"Basically, a farm will have three visits in one year in order to get an assessment,\" he says.\n\"If they have all of the provisions for the animals in terms of cages and enrichments and they feed them well and take care of them well, then they will get a good score. Any farm starts with score zero and then they get scores for everything they do. The best score they can get is 100, but I don't think anyone will get 100.\"\nThe \"Welfur\" assessments, as they are known, will look at housing and management conditions, but also observe how the animals themselves seem to be doing.\nOne of the tests involves putting a stick through the bars of the cage. Inquisitive mink that approach it are seen as well adjusted. Any that back off and appear fearful are considered likely to be living in stress.\nIn another room, a specially adapted cage includes a nest box, food, a running wheel and swimming water. Pressing the right lever allows access to each of these resources. Observing how often mink are prepared to press each lever to access different parts of the cage is used to measure the animal's preferences.\n\"They are quite good learners, says Mr Moller's colleague, Jens Malmkvist, \"so in that way, we can say we ask the animal what they want instead of what we think they want.\n\"The nest box - they want to work for this permanently. They will work for access to swimming water and they will work for access to a running wheel - however, on a low level, so maybe this is more like a luxury thing. It is a 'nice to have' rather than a 'need to have'.\"\nThose conclusions, based on various scientific studies, might seem rather convenient for the fur industry. Nest boxes are already attached to cages on mink farms. Adding running wheels or access to swimming water would be harder and more costly.\n\"We have done a lot of studies on other things that are easier to give them, like permanent access to straw or a shelf or something to play with,\" says Mr Malmkvist.\n\"The resources in the cage do matter for them, so we don't decide what they should have, but we try to provide some knowledge - if you have to enrich the cages, which things should you do first?\n\"And then, swimming water is not in the front line. It would be enriching for mink probably, but it's not the first thing to do if you have to invest in cages.\"\nFarms which have resources that mink appear to value most in scientific studies will score well under the \"Welfur\" scheme. Lesser scores are given for enrichments that are not so highly valued or are considered unproven.\nThe new welfare inspections are due to start in January 2017. They will cover the three main fur animal species farmed in Europe - the mink, the blue fox and the silver fox.\nFur Europe - the trade association behind the scheme - says an independent company is being used to conduct the checks.\nFarmers will have to pay towards the cost of their assessments, but taking part is voluntary.\n\"It is voluntary, yes, but to which extent, you can discuss,\" says Mette Lykke Hansen, Fur Europe's chief executive.\n\"We have had a statement from the European auction houses saying that from 2020, they will not sell skins that are not Welfur certified, so if you are not in the system, it will be very difficult to sell your skins from 2020 and onwards.\"\nIf any farm that opts for an assessment fails to reach an acceptable welfare score, it will also be unable to sell its furs at European auction houses, according to Fur Europe.\nIt does not intend to publish each farm's score - individual farmers can choose to do that if they wish. Instead, it says it will publish only aggregated data, possibly for each country.\nThe fur farmer Ceslovas Tallat-Kelpsa does plan to sign up. He keeps more than 200,000 mink on his farms in Lithuania. He thinks it will improve animal welfare standards and make European furs more competitive, boosting the price he is paid for his pelts.\n\"I believe it will increase,\" he says. \"Buyers want to buy certificated fur.\"\nHe told me that in 2015, the price paid per pelt barely covered his production costs. He received an average of \u20ac30 (\u00a326) for each one, when previously he had been paid about \u20ac70 (\u00a361) on average.\nThe fur industry is keen to convince people it is doing all it can to look after the animals in its care, but its Welfur scheme does not convince everyone.\n\"I have come to the conclusion that it is very little more than a PR lobbying tool to try and defend the fur industry, mostly within the European Union,\" says Mark Glover from Respect for Animals, which campaigns against the international fur trade.\n\"The criteria are economic. A mink cage, for instance, will never be longer than a person's arm, for obvious reasons of catching and handling the mink.\n\"They are incapable of making conditions anywhere near acceptable for the animal welfare of the mink and that is where we disagree with them entirely. Fur is an abhorrent product and the sooner it is banned, the better.\"\nFur farming was banned in England and Wales by the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000. At the time, there were 13 fur farms in England and none in Wales. Similar bans followed in other parts of the UK. The import and sale of fur skins and products is permitted.\nMink is the animal most commonly bred for its fur in Europe, where the biggest producer is Denmark. It produced 17.8 million mink skins in 2015, according to industry data from auction houses where the skins are traded.\nFur trims have become popular on garments, but the pelts are also used for other products including scarves, hats, cushions, key rings and coats.\nFashion designers such as Stella McCartney have refused to use real fur. Others have opted to use artificial \"faux\" fur instead. But real fur continues to appear on catwalks across Europe.\n\"I agree that it is not necessary,\" says fur farmer Ceslovas Tallat-Kelpsa, \"but in my mind it is a good product, very natural, very ecological.

He was detained alongside other syndicate members. The arrests were made in late April, but police only made it public late last week\nMr Yuan told the investigators he  made the  jellyfish by mixing three chemicals - alginic acid, ammonium alum and calcium chloride anhydrous - according to an official release (in Chinese) by Huzhou police on social media platform WeChat.\nOfficers say they found \"excessive levels\" of aluminium in the fake jellyfish - up to 800mg/kg, which is eight times of China's own legal limit.\nThe food and drug safety branch of Huzhou police said too much aluminium could result in bone and nerve damage, and potentially harm memory. They warned against pregnant women, children and the elderly consuming the substance.\nAlthough jellyfish can be poisonous they are considered something of a delicacy in China, described as both tasty and a good source of collagen.\nEspecially popular in the summer, jellyfish skin is sliced and served like a salad with various dressings.\nIt appears as if the wild jellyfish supply simply cannot cope with the demand.  Zhejiang's Metropolitan Express paper has reported on jellyfish farms in the province.  It quotes fish farmers  saying that half-a-kilo of jellyfish takes 40 days to raise, with the wholesale price at about 30-40 yuan.\nThis cost is halved with artificial jellyfish and for obvious reasons, the production time is far less.\nThe Huzhou police have issued guidance on how to spot the difference.\nArtificial jellyfish is tasteless with no smell and is tough to tear and has a texture similar to sellotape.\nThe real deal?  Quite the opposite.  It has a fishy smell, and is yellowish and colourful.\nIn November 2014, Huzhou police, again, caught three individuals selling fake jellyfish made from a similar chemical mixture.\nIn October 2013, police in central Hunan province broke another jellyfish syndicate.\nThat group is said to have made 40 tonnes of fake jellyfish, and the ringleader was sentenced to six months in jail.", "His family said a \"small, private ceremony\" on Wednesday was attended by \"family and close friends\".\nIn the statement, they thanked his fans for \"their many messages of love and support\" following the funeral, thought to have been held in London.\nMichael died of natural causes at his home in Goring-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, on Christmas Day.\nThe riverside cottage became a focus for fans' grief in the days after he died, as did his home in Highgate, north London.\nThe full statement from Michael's family read: \"We can confirm that the funeral of the singer George Michael took place today.

known as fibre to the premises (FTTP) - was too expensive to be widely delivered.\nBut Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach, said that new techniques now meant the company \"had recently halved the cost of delivering full fibre\".\n\"With the right conditions we believe we could make FTTP available to as many as 10 million homes and businesses by the mid-2020s, but we need to understand if there's sufficient demand to justify the rollout, and support for the enablers needed to build a viable business case.\n\"That includes removing barriers to investment and incentivising those, like Openreach, who are prepared to take a commercial risk.\"\nFTTP is widely regarded as the best way to deliver fast broadband services.\nUnlike fibre to the cabinet, which has been Openreach's preferred technology to date, it does not rely on a slower copper-based connection to connect local street cabinets to homes.\nFull fibre networks are typically more stable, efficient and reliable, with customers experiencing fewer faults and more predictable speeds than with hybrid copper and fibre broadband technology.\nThey can also support broadband speeds of up to 1Gbps, which is enough to download an entire HD TV programme in five seconds.\nMalcolm Corbett, who runs the Independent Networks Co-operative Association (Inca), believes the industry can reach about 80% full fibre coverage by 2026 without the need for major government subsidies.\nBut he added: \"Regarding the Openreach consultation, one aspect that we think particularly important is that Openreach doesn't use their new-found enthusiasm for full fibre to try to re-monopolise local access networks.\"\nEarlier this month, the government unveiled a \u00c2\u00a3400m fund aimed at boosting the UK's fibre-to-the-home infrastructure.\nThe Openreach consultation asks for views to be sent in by the end of September.", "Col Oliver Lee said he is \"extremely pleased\" that the case will be heard by the Courts Martial Appeal Court for a second time.\nHe resigned in protest after Blackman was convicted of murdering a Taliban insurgent at a court martial in 2013.\nBlackman, 42, from Taunton, was known during his trial as Marine A.\nCol Lee said the circumstances surrounding the killing needed to be reconsidered.\n\"A much more balanced and full picture of the situation in which he found himself needed to be presented,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nBlackman applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) after his earlier appeal was dismissed in 2014, which referred the conviction to the court after an 11-month investigation.\nThe court will look at new expert evidence relating to Blackman's mental state at the time of the killing.\nIt will also consider that the alternative verdict of \"unlawful act manslaughter\" was not available at his original trial.\nCol Lee said the court martial should have taken greater account of the acute stress Blackman was under at the time.\n\"I don't seek to condone his behaviour or exonerate him from his responsibilities,\" he said.\n\"I took a view that the proceedings against Sgt Blackman hadn't been balanced.\"\nDavid James Smith, lead CCRC commissioner on the case, said there was a \"real possibility\" that Blackman's second appeal would be successful.\n\"There are new issues -

All were related to his hidden medical past.\nDuring evidence at the inquiry, which concluded in August, it emerged that Mr Clarke had suffered an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope.\nHe passed out at the wheel while the bin lorry was on Queen Street in Glasgow city centre, just days before Christmas.\nJust 19 seconds later, the vehicle came to rest against the Millennium Hotel in George Square, leaving six people dead and 17 injured.\nThose killed in the crash were Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, from Dumbarton, Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh.", "From selling Avon Cosmetics products for a living, the young man from Northamptonshire decided the time was right to have a serious go at becoming a golf pro.\nIt was in 2014 when he had his 'Ding Dong' moment and he got 'the call' to leave Avon and concentrate on golf.\nSo far, after a solid first year on the Challenge Tour since stepping up to win his card for the main European Tour, the sweet smell of success has eluded him.\nBut his presence in Ayrshire for the 145th Open Championship at Royal Troon has got him sniffing the future with a lot more optimism.\n\"I can't wait,\" the 29-year-old European Tour rookie from Corby told BBC Sport. \"My first Open.

supported on this device\nLeigh Halfpenny kicked all of Wales' points, converting four of his five penalty kicks before going off injured.\nSouth Africa were limited to two Pat Lambie penalties as Wales largely contained the Springboks attacking threat.\nThe tourists had a late five-metre scrum but the Wales pack disrupted the set-piece to seal a famous win.\nPerhaps of more concern, however, was the injury to captain Jean de Villiers, who was carried off having dislocated his kneecap.\nMuch of the build-up to the match featured Wales coach Warren Gatland fielding questions about whether he was under pressure because of losses this series to Australia and New Zealand, taking his record to just one win in 27 matches against the southern hemisphere big three.\nThis win, to add to Wales' previous victory over South Africa in 1999 - also at the Millennium Stadium - provided a perfect riposte and kick-starts their build-up to next year's World Cup in England.\nOpposite number Heyneke Meyer had not been under quite the same scrutiny, although their 29-15 defeat by Ireland in their opening tour game had raised some questions that were answered in subsequent wins over England and Italy.\nBoth sides were missing players because of injuries and recalls to clubs, as this match took place outside World Rugby's official international window.\nWith George North concussed, Liam Williams stepped into the vacant Wales wing slot, given the opportunity to redeem himself after conceding the last-gasp penalty try that denied them victory in June's second Test in Nelspruit.\nGatland had also suffered a run of injuries among his loose-head props, while Paul James had to depart back to Bath, but he could still call on British and Irish Lion Gethin Jenkins to fill the number one shirt.\nHooker Richard Hibbard had also been recalled to Gloucester, while South Africa had to change their entire back three with wing Bryan Habana and full-back Johan Goosen returning to France and JP Pietersen departing for Japan.\nWales full-back Halfpenny and Springboks fly-half Lambie exchanged early penalties, with Halfpenny unfortunate to hit the outside of the post with a later effort.\nSpace for the backs to work in was at a premium in a hotly contested first half, with both sides up quickly with some typically fierce defence.\nWales' best moments came from chips ahead to turn the Springboks, the tactic enjoying particular success down the left wing.\nTwice Williams came close to collecting the bouncing ball to plunge over the try line, but each time Lwazi Mvovo was there a split-second before, covering across to snuff out the danger.\nSouth Africa almost broke the deadlock when Eben Etzebeth surged through the midfield, but he knocked on as the lock was scythed down by Halfpenny's thumping tackle on the 22-yard line.\nLambie missed a long-range penalty that would have sent the Boks into the changing rooms with a narrow half-time lead, leaving the match delicately poised at the halfway stage.\nHalfpenny and Lambie again exchanged early penalties after the restart, with the Springbok stand-off showing his range by slotting from the halfway line.\nWales enjoyed the best period of the game after that, keeping the ball in hand to pressurise the visitors into conceding two more penalties that Halfpenny converted.\nThrough all of this, the Wales half-back partnership of Rhys Webb and Dan Biggar shone, using possession wisely and keeping a level of control that South Africa found hard to wrest away.\nMeyer used his bench early, making four changes including putting Handre Pollard on at fly-half in place of Lambie.\nBut the Springboks coach was forced into another change soon when captain De Villiers was carried off, replaced by Damian de Allende.\nSouth Africa suffered a further blow when Cornal Hendricks was sin-binned for taking out Halfpenny in the air.\nThe Wales 15 was clearly shaken by the collision and left the field soon after, with Scott Williams coming on and Liam Williams switching to his preferred full-back position.\nSpurred on by their man advantage, Wales laid siege to the Springboks line but met furious resistance as first Jamie Roberts and then Scott Baldwin were stopped just short.\nIn the closing minutes, South Africa earned a five-metre scrum that threatened to undo all Wales' hard work and deliver another gut-wrenching late loss to a southern hemisphere side.\nBut the Wales pack rose to the challenge, making a mess of South Africa's platform and allowing the ball to be cleared upfield.\nWales kept their heads and kept the Springboks at bay for the final few moments to seal a well-deserved, and long overdue, win.\nWales: Halfpenny (Scott Williams 67), Cuthbert, Jonathan

footballers and a great way of playing football,\" he said.\n\"At Derby you could see as well that even in a lower division he tried to produce good football and obviously the pedigree is there.\"\nThe player was also pleased to reward Swansea's fans with only a second away league win of 2016-17, the first having come on the season's opening day at Burnley.\n\"For them it's been hard, but having a new manager in and starting 2017 with a win and 18 games to go, beating a rival is good,\" said Rangel.\n\"With us, confidence needs to be high. I think we need to believe that we've got enough quality.\n\"I think it's been a confidence issue, for me. Not picking up points, you don't play the same way and I think that's been the main issue.\n\"But with a win, you can look forward to the next few games.\"\nIt was Rangel's 10th goal in 10 seasons at Swansea and he believes it may prove to be his most important.\n\"It's still too early to say we are going to stay up, but for sure now we can look forward to the next few sessions with him and see what he wants from us,\" said Rangel.\n\"I was the lucky one to score the goal, but after so many weeks being probably, if you want to call it a 'shambles' or 'not well organised', we looked like a proper team and we deserved the win.\n\"Nothing's done yet.

They have remarkable physical properties - being more than 100 times stronger than steel.\nRay Baughman of the University of Texas at Dallas is a renowned researcher into the tubes' properties, and is a co-author of the new research.\n\"The carbon nanotube yarns comprise individual nanotubes - untold billions of them - that are about 1/100,000th the diameter of a human hair,\" he told the podcast of Science magazine.\nThe yarns were made by pulling sheets of nanotubes from \"forests\" of the tubes and twisting them to form a coiled structure - much as yarn is made from wool.\nThey were then dipped in an electrolyte - a fluid containing ions, electrically charged atoms. When a voltage was applied at the ends of the yarns, these ions moved into the fibres, causing them to expand.\nBecause of their coiled shape, this expansion led to them \"doing the twist\".\n\"The torque that we can generate per mass of the yarn is comparable to that of very large electric motors,\" said Prof Baughman.\n\"But as you down-size electric motors you dramatically decrease... the torque capabilities per weight, and make the motors very expensive.\"\nHe said that motors made from the yarns would find use in what is known as microfluidics, \"for chemical 'labs on a chip' that can be used for analysis of chemicals, or for sensing\".\n\"Often you want to control the movement of fluids, you want to pump them from one place to another or turn off one flow and open up another, and the carbon nanotube muscles because of their very small size seem very suitable for this type of application.\"", "The result can be that the decision-making becomes inherently biased, albeit accidentally.\nTry searching online for an image of \"hands\" or \"babies\" using any of the big search engines and you are likely to find largely white results.\nIn 2015, graphic designer Johanna Burai created the World White Web project after searching for an image of human hands and finding exclusively white hands in the top image results on Google.\nHer website offers \"alternative\" hand pictures that can be used by content creators online to redress the balance and thus be picked up by the search engine.\nGoogle says its image search results are \"a reflection of content from across the web, including the frequency with which types of images appear and the way they're described online\" and are not connected to its \"values\".\nMs Burai, who no longer maintains her website, believes things have improved.\n\"I think it's getting better... people see the problem,\" she said.\n\"When I started the project people were shocked.

The composition and structure of the collected samples could help explain the origin and evolution of dust in space.\nDr Andrew Westphal, from the Space Sciences Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, told BBC News: \"Our results are giving us the first glimpse of the complexity and diversity of interstellar dust particles.\"\nA preliminary analysis by Dr Westphal and colleagues, published in Science, showed that the seven interstellar candidates are much more diverse in size, chemical composition and structure than anyone had pictured before based on previous astronomical observations and theories.\n\"It could easily have been that our answer when we did this project was to find that all interstellar dust particles are similar, and we are not finding that at all. They are all different from each other.\"\nComet dust is older. The material out of which our Solar System formed was heated, melted, mixed and transformed as the Sun and the planets began to take shape. The comets represent the relics of this process and are therefore representative of the composition of our early planetary system.\nStardust was two missions in one. Although it is mostly known for its close encounter with Comet Wild 2, the spacecraft also captured dust flowing in the interstellar dust stream. This stream carries particles made by stars in different parts of our galaxy.\nStardust was equipped with a device called the Interstellar Dust Collector, a tennis-racket sized mosaic of 132 tiles made of the lightest manmade solid, referred to as aerogel. This is a silicon-based material that is more than 99% empty space.\nThe dust particles can travel at hypervelocity, more than 5km per second. Like a net, this light, fluffy aerogel captured dust particles without vaporising them by slowing them down gradually.\nMore than 30,000 volunteers who signed up to the Stardust@home project examined millions of images of the aerogel in search of the carrot-shaped trails left by the incoming hypervelocity particles, which are about two millionths of a metre in diameter.\nBut not all of the particles embedded in the aerogel are of interstellar origin. The researchers determined that all but three of the tracks were caused by tiny bits of the spacecraft.\nFour more possible interstellar particles, as tiny as 0.4 millionths of a metre, were found encrusted in minute craters in the aluminium foil around the aerogel tiles.\nThe seven dust particles are composed of different silicates - minerals consisting of silica, oxygen and metals - which indicate that each particle may have its own history.\n\"[The particles] may have formed in one star and were then processed over tens of millions of years in the interstellar medium and mixed in with particles coming from other stars or even particles that formed in the interstellar medium in cold molecular clouds; so it's probably a mixture of lots of different things,\" explained Dr Westphal.\nDr Westphal and his colleagues plan further tests to the published results.\nThe final proof lies in the levels of different chemical oxygen forms, known as isotopes, within them. A different concentration than that found in our Solar System would indicate their extra-solar origin.\nIt will require several years of hard work to refine the techniques available to measure the abundance of oxygen isotopes in the dust particles without destroying them.\nDr Westphal added: \"It's a necessary step before we dare to do anything with the real thing. The problem is that they are just so rare\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we cannot dare to take any chances.\"\nMore data remain to be analysed.

Once enough pressure exists, you get lift-off.\"\nThe last such event in a similar spot was in the 1960s, and the last significant eruptions nearby - about a kilometre away - were in 2000 and 2001, said Mr Scott.\nBut the wider area is known for geothermal activity, drawing tourists to what Visit Rotorua describes as \"its spouting geysers, bubbling mud pools and colourful sinter terraces\".\n\"Ever since we have had written records there have been accounts of these steam-driven eruptions occurring. Today's event was similar to many in the past.

It is a mockery of proper democratic practice.\n\"The UK does not recognise the referendum or its outcome, in common with the majority of the international community.\"\nWith reports of more disturbances in the city of Donetsk in the largely pro-Russian eastern Ukraine, Mr Hague went on to warn the Kremlin against any further military incursion into Ukrainian territory.\n\"Any attempt by the Russian Federation to use the referendum as an excuse to annex the Crimea, or to take further action on Ukrainian territory, would be unacceptable,\" he said.\n\"I call on Russia to enter into dialogue with Ukraine and with the international community to resolve this crisis through diplomacy and in accordance with international law, not to exacerbate it further through unilateral and provocative actions.\"\nMr Hague was speaking from Brussels where, on Monday, he is expected to discuss a range of possible sanctions with other EU ministers.

Today Mr Costantini is 68 years old, and the self-made boss of an investment and property development empire which stretches from Argentina to the US.\nHe is considered a guru in Argentina for his ability to predict financial trends.\nAn avid art collector, he also owns one of the largest collections of Latin American art, which is housed in a museum he built in Buenos Aires in the 1990s.\nYet for all Mr Costantini's successes, there have been failures and controversies along the way.\nAfter leaving school Mr Costantini did an economics degree at the Catholic University of Argentina in Buenos Aires, graduating in 1971. He then moved to the UK to do a masters in the same subject at the University of East Anglia in Norwich.\nUpon returning to Argentina, Mr Costantini started his business empire in 1975, when he launched his own investment business, Consultatio.\nHe used the profits to start buying up property, which he then developed and sold on at a higher price.\nBy the end of the 1970s business was thriving, and Consultatio's property arm has gone on to help build sizeable new suburbs in Buenos Aires.\nAnd from 1991 to 1993 Mr Costantini found the time to serve as vice president of one of Argentina's largest banks, BBVA Banco Frances.\nBut if Mr Costantini's successful day job involves investment and property development, his passion is collecting art.\nI think that life, after all, is a collection of different moments and aspects that you have to build with patience and perseverance\n\"One day I saw this gallery where I really liked the works of Argentine artist Antonio Berni,\" he says.\n\"So I got in and bought my first two paintings. And I couldn't stay away from art since then.\"\nHe has since gone on to build a big collection of paintings and other art works from across Latin America.\nBut rather than lock them away, in 2001 he opened the Latin American Art Museum of Buenos Aires, or Malba, a futuristic building that he paid for.\nWhile such philanthropy has been welcomed by commentators in Argentina, some of Mr Costantini's developments have faced criticism, such as the upmarket new north Buenos Aires neighbourhood of Nordelta.\nBuilt on former swampland in 1999, the large gated community has more than 40,000 residents, who have their own luxury harbour, shopping malls, sports clubs and medical centre.\nOnly one hour away from the buzz of central Buenos Aires, but a world apart, peaceful and relaxed Nordelta is home to football players, TV celebrities and business people.\nYet Nordelta has also had some unwelcome residents.\nThe development is sometimes dubbed a haven for Latin American drug dealers who are looking for a discreet retreat for their families. And in recent years some suspected drug traffickers have been arrested there.\nMr Costantini says he is worried about such things, adding that he is working with the authorities to find out the identity of such people, whom he says are a very small number of residents.\nHe has also faced criticism for only focusing on the expensive end of the property market, but Mr Costantini says he simply enjoys building \"high-end projects that are aimed at those who can afford to pay a little more\".\nThe Boss is a series profiling entrepreneurs from around the world.\nIn terms of overseas property developments, Mr Costantini's main focuses are neighbouring Uruguay and the US.\nHis American developments are centred on Florida, where he is building luxurious apartment complexes in Miami.\nYet he wasn't always so successful in the US, and looks back on a failed attempt to establish himself as an investor in New York.\n\"I had this utopian idea of trying to establish myself in New York in the 80s... so I moved there with my family,\" he says.\nThe world is getting wealthier - but with the gap between rich and poor feeling bigger than ever, who are the winners and losers of this richer world in 2015?\nA Richer World 2015\nListen to the reports and documentaries\n\"But I was like [the legend of] Don Quixote fighting against the windmills, because all the big fishes like Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs were already there.\n\"So basically, the Big Apple didn't accept me. I came back to Argentina and to my business after a few months.\"\nDespite the failure, he says he has no regrets.\n\"I could go back now [to New York], I have the money and the expertise, but I think I made the right decision.\"\nInstead he is focusing on his developments in Miami, and building one of the newest skyscrapers in downtown Buenos Aires.\nLooking back on his long career so far, he says: \"I think that life, after all, is a collection of different moments and aspects that you have to build with patience and perseverance.\"", "Ricky Hill walked out of Royal Derby Hospital where he was being treated for an overdose and hanged himself on site.\nCoroner Dr Robert Hunter concluded there was no plan at the hospital to prevent him killing himself.\nHe told an inquest he would also write to Derbyshire police for a second time criticising its search procedures.\nDr Hunter returned a narrative conclusion at the inquest in Derby which found Mr Hill, 30, took his own life while an inpatient partly because \"no effective measures were put in place to prevent him doing so\".\nSpeaking after the hearing, his widow, Dawn Hill said: \"I'm just glad that it's all over and we've got justice for Ricky because that's why we're all here.\"\nThe court heard Mr Hill walked out of hospital in September 2014 for a cigarette but never came back.\nSecurity were alerted but took down an incorrect description which was then passed to police.\nThe first officer on the scene searched the site from a police car using the incorrect description.\nAnother officer later used an out of date satellite image from Google Earth to check the site, which still showed the hospital under construction.\nMr Hill's body was found by a local resident in a wooded area on hospital grounds in January 2015.\nAlthough the coroner concluded he was dead before the police were called Dr Hunter still had \"serious concerns\" about the search and said he would write to the force's chief constable.\nThe court also heard nurses lacked training in dealing with mental health patients at the hospital and they had not been told about hospital guidelines.\nDr Hunter said he would write to the Department of Health raising concerns that changes should be made at all hospitals.\nFollowing the conclusion of the hearing Deputy Ch Con Peter Goodman said: \"We want to apologise to the family of Ricky Hill.\n\"We recognise we made mistakes at the time he went missing and subsequent in our search for him there were areas we could have done better.\"\nHe added the force would work with the coroner to address further concerns.\nCathy Winfield, chief nurse at the Royal Derby Hospital, also apologised to the family during the hearing and offered her condolences.\nSpeaking afterwards, she said: \"We've run a robust teaching programme for doctors and nurses to help them identify [mental health needs] but also assess the level of risk patients might be facing.\"", "Spectators marched down Pershore Road, lugging coolboxes full of enough food to last a week. The optimistic wore shorts, the realistic carried umbrellas.\nTraffic was nearly static, bumper to bumper. Parking was enough of a nightmare to make the \u00a315 space offered by the Church of St Mary and St Ambrose seem appealing, certainly more so than the \u00a320 spot peddled by the chap across the street.\nEven the local council seemed unaware that something out of the ordinary was going on.\nIts temporary traffic order demanded no stopping between 08:00 and 20:00. Stop for as long as you like at 21.30, which is when 20,000 or so would be leaving Edgbaston.\nOnly when you studied Sir Harry's chip shop, or the Edgbaston Tap pub, did you know that the body clock needed adjusting.\nThe queue spilling outside of the chippy suggested a lunchtime rush. Test-match goers are thirsty, but even they wouldn't make the boozer that busy before the traditional 11am start of play.\nYet they were among what turned out to be very few differences.\nYes, the brightness of the pink ball was a novelty as England's Alastair Cook faced the first delivery in the Birmingham sunshine.\nThe pink leather had been the source of much speculation in the build-up. Would it misbehave, either in the natural, artificial or twilight? Would it lose its hardness and create turgid cricket?\nAs it turned out, West Indies could have been bowling with a red, white, blue or medicine ball. Their scattergun attack was powerless to stop Cook and Joe Root from putting England in command to reach 348-3 on the first day.\nThe Windies have not won a Test in this country since 2000. The day-nighter has given them little hope of altering that wretched run.\nIf a change of start time has done nothing for the fortunes of the tourists, then it has only marginally helped England in the bid to solve their oldest problem.\nOnce again there was a reliance on Cook and Root to score the runs. Mark Stoneman completed a dozen of opening partners for Cook in the space of five years, but made just eight on his debut. Tom Westley managed the same score at number three.\nAt least Dawid Malan came through the genuine darkness which only arrived half an hour before the scheduled close to have the opportunity to cash in on Friday afternoon.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIf the on-field narrative stayed the same despite the altered playing conditions, then so too did the routine, rhythm and supporting cast that accompanies a Test in the UK.\nThe intervals remained the same length and even kept the names lunch and tea despite being shifted three hours backwards.\n\"I was yawning at nine o'clock because that is my bedtime,\" joked Cook.\n\"We are programmed to start at 11am when we play in white kit, but that is nothing more than a mental thing.\"\nWe are told on a regular basis that day-night matches become accessible to those who do not want to take time off work, that the stands will gradually fill with white collars arriving from the office.\nThe first day at Edgbaston did little to support that theory. The majority of the 21,649 that attended were there to see the first ball. Seats that were empty when play got under way remained vacant all day.\nFor most of the spectators, if any cricket was to be missed, it was at the end of the day, with some starting to file out about an hour before the players left the field.\nEven the atmosphere followed the pattern of a normal day at the Test.\nWhen he met the media on Wednesday, captain Root wondered how the famously raucous Hollies Stand might become even more rowdy after a morning in the pub and an extended evening of drinking.\nBut even the Hollies shifted its schedule, only fully finding its voice in the final session, just as if the Test followed regular hours.\nFor two sessions, it was quite sedate, but when it awoke, it was a spectacle in itself.\nCops chased robbers, then robbers chased cops. Mr Blobby led a conga line and the singing of Cook's name was loud enough to drown out the brass of Billy the Barmy Army trumpeter.\nIt might be that Friday and Saturday, usually the most chaotic, are when the Hollies goes bigger, earlier.\nIn all the similarities to a regular day of Test cricket, there is one difference that we can be sure of.\nOf the 73,000 tickets sold over the first three days, Warwickshire say that 50% have been snapped up by spectators who have never before been to watch the longest form of the game.\nWhy has the day-nighter attracted a new audience to Test cricket?\n\"That it's the first day-nighter makes it more exciting,\" said Louise from Southam, who was attending a Test for the first time.\n\"If I enjoy it today, then I'd absolutely come back to another Test, even if it isn't a day-nighter.\"\nSometimes, the lasting impact of a historical moment doesn't reveal itself until long after the event.\nThe first tennis match under the Centre Court roof at Wimbledon held a significance because the retractable rain shield was always likely to change the way we watched events unfold at SW19.\nLikewise, the first red card dished out by a referee was destined to be the first of many.\nBut, the first supersub in a one-day international, or the first football match settled by a golden goal have been forgotten because neither innovation caught on.\nSo, the legacy of this first day-night Test in England will only be revealed by the passing of time.\nIt has not been played for the benefit of spectators, either at Edgbaston or watching at home, but to help the England team, who face day-nighters in both Australia and New Zealand this winter.\nIn 2018, India and Pakistan will be England's opposition in home Tests. Late finishes in the UK would not suit TV viewers in either of those countries.\nThe following year, Australia arrive for the Ashes. There may be a reluctance to tamper with that series, especially when ticket sales are usually incredibly strong for the visit of the oldest enemy.\nThe next day-nighter in this country could be 2020 at the earliest, with Warwickshire chief executive Neil Snowball even saying this match could be the \"first and last\".\n\"I can see it being successful in other parts of the world, but whether we need to in England is a different matter,\" said Cook.\n\"We're lucky in England that the crowds we get everywhere we play are fantastic.\n\"It's interesting and the players understand their responsibility to try these things.\"\nThe crowd in attendance is one thing, but domestic TV ratings should be monitored closely.\nIf Test cricket at primetime causes a spike in viewership, it is easy to imagine a scenario when broadcasters and administrators want more of the pink ball, especially when cricket's biggest ever rights deal has just been signed.\nThe pink ball and floodlights hint at a brave new world, but perhaps television will still be king.\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same.", "Philippe Douste-Blazy, who previously worked as a cardiologist, assisted the birth alongside a midwife.\nThe baby was born above Algeria around two hours before the plane landed at Charles de Gaulle airport, travelling from Gabon's capital Libreville.\nBoth mother and baby are said to be doing well.\nMr Douste-Blazy was returning from a World Health Organization conference when a flight attendant made an announcement asking if there was a doctor on board.\n\"A young woman in her twenties who was seven months pregnant was clearly having contractions and her water broke,\" he explained.\n\"We placed towels and pillows on the floor and delivered there.\"\nHe praised the woman for her courage, saying: \"She suffered a lot and there was not much (medicine) on the plane.\"\nMr Douste-Blazy served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2005-2007.

A presenter described the Israeli reaction as \"hysterical\", \"outrageous\" and \"expressing a kind of uncontrolled nervousness\".\nOn its Sunday night 10 PM programme the presenter said \"we want to know the circumstances surrounding this decision, which was a wish for some people and a nightmare for others\".\nGen Samih Sayf al-Yazal told the programme that that an Israeli warning to its citizens to leave Sinai three days earlier had been a \"pre-emptive move\" after Israel had allegedly learned of Egypt's intention to suspend gas supplies. He said the cancellation was \"in response to popular wishes with respect to the gas issue. The Egyptian people feel shocked about this contract, and feel that their money has been plundered\". He was sure that Egypt's military government, which has not commented so far, was consulted on the decision. The Gas Holding Company \"cannot take such a decision without informing the country's leaders\", Gen Al-Yazal concluded.\nProminent Egyptian Facebook and blog commentators noted the official reticence. The 6th of April Youth Movement's Facebook page reported the news with suspicion: \"Ten minutes and we will find a denial of the news from another part of the leadership.\"\nOn her English-language blog \"Egyptian Chronicles\", Zeinobia commented, \"Ok news is contradictory in Cairo. There are military sources as well as the minister of oil in Egypt that have denied the news that they cancelled the agreement to export gas to Israel while there are confirmed sources saying that Cairo has cancelled the deal !!\"\nTwitter users were generally enthusiastic, Leftwing Nasserite presidential candidate Hamdin Sabbahi tweeted: \"I hail the decision to stop exporting Egyptian gas to the Zionist entity. We hope the implementation of the decision will continue out of respect for the will of the people and the judiciary's rulings, and in order to protect our national wealth.\"\n\"Dangerous precedent\"\nIsraeli public broadcasters concentrated on statements by Israeli officials, in particular Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman's call for Egypt to reverse its decision so that the commercial disagreement might not turn into a \"political issue\".\nPress comment was gloomier, with a general view that relations can only deteriorate further. Zvi Barel in liberal Ha'aretz said that \"if it turns out that Egypt has really unilaterally decided to terminate the agreement, it may be a dangerous precedent that indicates other agreements between Egypt and Israel may also come to an end\".\nAmir Ben-David in mass-circulation Yediot Aharonot also saw a threat to the Camp David accords: \"This move could turn out to be a first, fundamental step in abrogating the peace agreements.\"\nBoaz Bismuth in the pro-government freesheet Yisrael Hayom went even further, saying that \"our southern neighbour could turn into an enemy state much earlier than expected. Egypt will no longer supply us with gas, but will continue to supply us, regrettably, with other combustible material\".\nBBC Monitoring\n selects and translates news from radio, television, press, news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages.

One is that the ONS figure is for immigration from both inside and outside the EU. At the moment, the EU accounts for just under half of total net migration.\nAnd second, the ONS numbers are not a forecast of what they expect to happen.

It is a trend that should deeply trouble the authorities.\nA tenuous possibility is that the military has not gone on the offensive because of the ceasefire order, although a recent statement from the defence headquarters said that a \"highly coordinated air bombardment is already yielding required results in the mission to repel the unwarranted attacks on citizens\" in the north-east.\nSuch teamwork between the air force and ground troops was successful when the military prevented Boko Haram from taking over Konduga, near Maiduguri, to public acclaim in September.\nThe belief that Boko Haram informants have infiltrated certain army units appears to have damaged morale among soldiers on the frontline, who now fear that their own brave efforts could be wasted. Hence the common desertions in the face of battle.\n\"Any cases of infiltration, if any, would not be significant enough to undermine the combat efficiency of the military and its capacity to bring the military campaign to a successful conclusion,\" asserts Major Lancelot Anyanya (Retired), a security analyst.\n\"Where the issue is radicalisation, you have to look to fight long-term with arms and counter-ideology.

If the labour market becomes too competitive it could push inflation up sharply by forcing wages to rise. This could then force the Fed to raise interest rates quickly, and threaten growth in the US economy.\n\"[The minutes were] broadly consistent with the message we got with the [July] statement, which is that, by acknowledging that near-term risks have diminished, it was an ever-so-slight and incremental step towards signalling a rate hike at some point.

The risk/reward for players to dive is not in the right place.\n\"If a player is thinking 'I need to do something to try and get a point or win a game and if I hit the deck here I can get away with it and get a penalty and if I get caught I get a yellow card' that is not much of a deterrent.

On a Monday morning, the disciplinary committee meet and look at all the controversial plays from the weekend and if they involve simulation then, providing the five-man panel are unanimous then that player, if he has won a penalty for his team and got a material benefit then that player will then get suspended. It works.\n\"Players come here knowing that if they dive and got away with it on the day they will pay the price later down the road.\n\"I think it was Sean Dyche who said if we introduce this it will get rid of diving in six months and lets hope he is right because it is a cancer that we cannot allow to grow.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nReaction from Premier League managers has so far been mixed.\nCrystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce says the plans are \"utter rubbish\" and called for video technology and sin-bins instead, while West Brom manager Tony Pulis embraced the idea.\n\"Every manager and club will say it's happened to them, but it's something we want to take out of the game,\" Pulis said.\n\"I'm pleased it's the way forward. I don't think there's any place for it in the game. I would most probably fine the players as well and give the money to charity.\"\nSwansea manager Paul Clement echoed Allardyce's comments in saying punishment for diving should come during the game rather than retrospectively.\n\"It's not the answer. Video technology and looking at instant replays of major incidents are the steps that need to be taken,\" Clement said.\n\"The problem is if you're on the end of a potential dive that could cost you points, retrospective action is not going to help you and your team.\n\"What it can do is potentially help another team as that player could be banned for future fixtures, so I don't see retrospective bans as the answer.\n\"Any punishment has to be done there and then.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nBBC commentator Roddy Forsyth on BBC Radio 5 live\nWhen the ban came in there were the same objections in Scotland as we are hearing now south of the border.\nThe ban doesn't make a complete difference because some players will still do it but it does now have a stigma attached to it. It hasn't eliminated diving, it never will, but it has reduced it.\nAlex Schalk got a penalty for Ross County against Celtic last month, there was no contact in the box. It was amazing to all of us that the referee did not see it but his anger was such that he thought there might have been.\nThe television replays proved instantly that the player had dived, the penalty was given and they scored it.

And in France the right-wing National Front is getting a lot of support based on  its anti-immigration stance.\nThe only curious question is why there has not been the emergence of an anti-immigration party here.\nPerhaps it is because South Africans are still preoccupied by uniting a divided country than to systematically unite against others?\nWhat attracts fellow Africans here is not the infrastructure created by apartheid South Africa, but the post-apartheid economic policy that has increased the size of the economy.\nIt is also a vote for political freedoms protected by one of the most liberal constitutions in the world.\nSouth Africa is home to millions of migrants, some estimates put the figure at more than four million.\nWith the best of intentions, South Africa's sophisticated but sluggish economy finds it hard to cope with the huge numbers of economic migrants alongside its own struggling population.\nBlack South Africans feel that they got a raw deal twice over.\nFirst, they fought for equal pay with their white counterparts. Apartheid ended and, just as they were about to earn the same salary for the same job, then came their distant cousins who readily accepted lower wages which undercut them.\nAccording to a study by Africa Check \"international migrants in South Africa are more likely to take jobs that locals are not willing to take or find work in the informal sector\".\nCity Press Newspaper editor-at-large Mondli Makhanya is a staunch critic of the government but told the BBC that  \"the events have been used by other countries around the continent to beat up South Africa\".\n\"Even President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe believes he has moral high ground. He is responsible for sending many of his citizens here.\"\nMr Makhanya added that \"immigration is not just a South African issue. It's a global problem\".\nAddressing Freedom Day celebrations on 27 April, and while condemning the violent attacks on foreigners, President Jacob Zuma said: \"We cannot shy away from discussing the reasons that forced migrants to flee to South Africa.

No O'Loughlin, Sam and Joel Tomkins, McIlorum, Clubb, Manfredi - yet their will to win remains very much intact.\n\"Warrington are highly entertaining, and in the mood can blaze a trail through any defence. If self-belief is flowing, they'll be hard to stop.\"\nBBC Radio 5 live's George Riley: \"Warrington are one of the most watchable teams in the game with ball in hand. When they get on a roll they play the ball so quickly, and Daryl Clark, Kurt Gidley and Stefan Ratchford can run riot. They will win a Grand Final, whether they win it this time or not.\n\"Wigan never know when they are beaten. Winger Josh Charnley tells me they are 'unique' in that they're a team of players playing in unfamiliar positions yet look completely at home. That they have reached Old Trafford without Sean O'Loughlin and Sam Tomkins is a huge credit to Shaun Wane and his team's spirit.\"\nBBC Radio Merseyside's Ray French: \"Wigan's rough, rugged pack, strong running half-backs, and powerful finishers in the three-quarter line versus Warrington's pacy, ball-handling set of six, tricky, exciting halves and creative footballers behind - a contrast of talents. What a contest in prospect. But one so difficult from which to predict a winner.\"\nBBC Radio Manchester's Jack Dearden: \"Winning the Super League Grand Final will be as easy as ADC - Attack. Defence. Composure.\n\"Warrington have Super League's best attack so arguably that's their strength, while Wigan's coach Shaun Wane frequently refers to his team's 'D' - defence. The Warriors will have to get that right if they're to win. Staying composed and being able to evaluate everything a Grand Final can throw at you is another key component to success.

His co-defendants were referred to as Marine B and Marine C and they were acquitted of murder.\nBlackman's supporters say the killing was manslaughter, not murder, and launched a campaign to review the case.\nDuring his trial, Blackman said he had believed the victim was already dead and he had been taking out his anger on a corpse.\nThe CCRC said the appeal court would now either uphold the conviction, quash the conviction, quash the conviction and substitute it with another or quash the conviction and order a retrial.\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: \"We will continue to co-operate fully with any legal process involving Sergeant Blackman's case.\"", "Opposition parties are bidding to have the legislation, which is aimed at tackling sectarianism, repealed.\nSNP MSP John Mason said the chaotic scenes at Hampden showed that \"this would not be an appropriate time to relax the law\" in relation to football.\nBut Labour's James Kelly said it showed up the \"inadequate nature\" of the act.\nFormer justice secretary Kenny MacAskill said the legislation could be \"reviewed and refined\" in light of the Hampden disorder.\nAll four opposition parties pledged to repeal the act in their manifestos, with only the minority SNP administration backing it.\nMr Kelly has started work on a Member's Bill to repeal the \"hated\" legislation, which was introduced in 2012.\nCritics say there is already sufficient legislation in place to tackle sectarianism and other football-related offences including disorder at matches, and say the act unfairly targets law-abiding fans.\nHowever, Glasgow Shettleston MSP John Mason said the scenes of disorder at Hampden, when supporters clashed on the field after Hibs beat Rangers 3-2, showed this was not the time to roll back the law.\nThe Clyde FC fan's motion notes that parliament \"shares widely the disappointment at the scenes felt following the game\", which saw mounted police deployed as fights broke out and fans tore up the turf and broke a set of goalposts.\nHe said that while \"football can be a great opportunity for fans to let off steam...there have to be limits as to what behaviour is acceptable\".\nThe motion further states that parliament should \"note calls to change the law in relation to football, including repealing the ban on alcohol and relaxing the rules on offensive behaviour, and, in light of the recent situation, considers that this would not be an appropriate time to relax the law in either of these areas\".\nMr Kelly said that, on the contrary, the \"unacceptable scenes\" at Hampden were evidence that the act was \"not adequate\".\nHe said: \"Charges brought against those involved are likely to be for breach of the peace or assault.\n\"This underlines the inadequate nature of this legislation, which has caused distrust between football fans and police. I will therefore be pressing ahead with my plans to repeal the discredited football act.\"\nJustice Secretary Michael Matheson has updated the Scottish government cabinet on the police and Scottish Football Association investigations into the incident.\nHe has urged the SFA to come back with a report on the matter before the new football season begins, so that any lessons can be learned before more matches are played.\nMeanwhile, Mr Matheson's predecessor Mr MacAskill, who retired as an MSP at the election earlier in May, said the legislation could be improved.\nHe said: \"I think it has to be retained, but I think it could perhaps be improved to make sure that some who have not been prosecuted can be.\n\"Scotland still has an issue. Saturday could have been catastrophic - albeit a lot of it was done with the good intentions of [fans] enjoying themselves.\n\"Let the SFA, let Police Scotland do the work.

A map from the Cirque du Soleil group shows how such schemes are springing up all over the world.\nPractitioners claim that teaching children circus skills helps them to trust other people, improves their \"physical literacy\", and raises their self-esteem and sense of identity.\nThese are skills that are particularly useful for young people in conflict zones and divided societies - and there have been projects in places such as Afghanistan, Bosnia and Northern Ireland.\nThe circus is rarely seen as a threat and this has allowed organisations like Clowns Without Borders to bring circus to families in refugee camps or warzones. This humanitarian project, which aims to relieve suffering through making people laugh, began in the conflict in the 1990s in the break-up of Yugoslavia. It now operates in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.\nThere has also been the Mobile Mini Circus for Children in Afghanistan, running since 2002. The founder, David Mason, said he wanted to give children \"the childhood they had been deprived of after so many decades of war\".\nMr Mason said children in warzones can feel powerless and enter \"survival mode\", but working together as a team to learn new skills and perform them in front of an audience helps them to develop their own identities.\nIn an attempt to measure the value of such circus education projects, the Circus Research Network was set up last year, bringing together academics and those running \"social circus\" schemes, into the discipline now referred to as \"circademics\".\nMore stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch\nThe head of the network, Ron Beadle of Northumbria University, says the number of research projects into circus is growing rapidly and there is \"compelling evidence\" that circus benefits disaffected young people.\nProf Beadle wants circus to become an option in the school curriculum. \"These transformative effects can be achieved with only an hour of teaching a week, which takes no more time than a PE lesson,\" he says.\nHe argues that circus is different to music and sport because learners soon reach a level where they can teach others. 'Teaching other kids gives them an early experience of responsibility which is hugely valuable,' he says.\nOne of the UK's longest-running circus schools is based in Belfast and celebrates its 30th anniversary this month.\nThe Belfast Community Circus School was set up as a response to the Troubles and its brightly-painted circus van became a regular sight on the Shankill Road and Falls Road in the 1980s and 1990s.\nWill Chamberlain, head of the circus school, said they were quickly accepted by both communities because unlike other activities such as music and sport, circus was not \"owned\" by any particular religious or political group.\n\"People thought: 'What could be crazier than starting a circus in Belfast in the middle of the Troubles?' So they left us to it,\" he said.\nFor many years the group worked with St Vincent's Centre, a school for 11 to 16 year olds who have been excluded from mainstream education.\nTeachers reported improvements in pupils' behaviour, attendance, and literacy rates with only two hours of circus training every week. Soon afterwards, circus became a formal part of the curriculum at St Vincent's.\nToday the Circus School's weekly skills workshop in the centre of Belfast is attended by 300 children a week, with 1,200 on a waiting list.\nMr Chamberlain said circus has worked well in Belfast because of the physical risks involved in thrill-seeking activities like walking a tightrope or acrobatics.\n\"Circus gives an outlet for safe, supported risk-taking to marginalised young people,'\" he said.\nIt also encourages children to trust other people regardless of their religion. \"We do not sit down and talk to kids about how they are all the same or anything like that,\" he said.\n\"But if you are a Protestant lad on top of a human pyramid and the person holding you up is Catholic, you can't just walk away. You have to trust them.\"\nSocial circus does not only aim to change young people who are taught new skills, but also the adults who come to watch them perform.\nNoFit State Circus in Wales has run skills workshops with children from the Shirenewton and Rover Way sites for gypsy, Roma and traveller people in Cardiff.\nIn the most recent project, the circus spent 12 weeks with children from the Rover Way caravan site. At the end, they performed in front of 500 people at an arts festival.\n\"When people hear there is a circus performance or a free workshop, they tend to show up,\" says Lynn Carroll, community manager at NoFit State Circus.\n\"The perceptions that so many people have about the Roma community are terrible and they often come from myths perpetuated in the media.\n\"When adults see these young people working hard and performing new skills, they learn to ignore these myths and it breaks down barriers between the travelling and settled communities.\"\nBelfast's Will Chamberlain says circus is a valuable outreach tool because it does not require children to be able to read or write and it does not pit them against each other.\n\"In most activities some kids are better than everyone else at academic work, music or sport, but circus is all about working as a team and achieving your own potential,\" he says.\n\"Any child can learn a circus skill, whether it is juggling, trapeze, performing magic tricks. Or even being a clown.\"", "Starting in north east Wales, Stephen Crabb and Lord Maude's visits include Airbus in Broughton and Wrexham-based financial services company DTCC.\nMr Crabb said he wanted to \"showcase our country to the world\", and show how the UK government could help companies.\nForeign investment created over 5,000 Welsh jobs in 2015, ministers said.\n\"Last year 4,000 Welsh companies took their first steps into export, and this year we are already up to 3000,\" Mr Crabb said as the tour began on Thursday.\n\"I urge those companies considering exporting to go on the Exporting is Great website or come to the first ever Exporting is Great roadshow in Wales, which kicks off next month.\"\nLord Maude added: \"It has been inspiring seeing the enthusiasm for exporting here in Wales, and hearing the success that can be achieved when companies start to expand overseas.\n\"With exports approaching \u00c2\u00a33bn each year in Wales alone, there is clearly demand out there for UK products and services.\"\nOn Friday, Lord Maude will be in Deeside, visiting Toyota's engine plant and medical supplies firm ConvaTec, where he will meet the Welsh government's Economy Minister Edwina Hart.\nUK Trade and Investment, the government department responsible for encouraging investment by overseas firms, works with the Welsh government to bring projects to Wales.\nOn Wednesday, Mrs Hart announced plans for up to 44 events in 16 countries to raise Wales' trade and tourism profile in 2016-17.", "21 March 2016 Last updated at 19:10 GMT\nThose who died when their car entered the water at Buncrana pier on Sunday were the husband, sister, mother and two sons of Louise McGrotty, from Londonderry.\nThey have been named as Sean McGrotty, 49, his sons Mark, 12, and Evan, 8, his mother-in-law Ruth Daniels, 59 and Ruth's daughter Jodie Lee Daniels, 14.\nFrank McGrotty, Sean McGrotty's brother, told Irish broadcaster RT\u00c3\u2030 that the whole family had been left devastated.", "But 130 mile (209km) away its lesser-known namesake, Downing Street in Newport, has no such claim to fame.\nWhile one has been home to prime ministers for almost three centuries, the other has some residents who have never seen the inside of a polling station.\nOne is lined with armed police officers, the other with wheelie bins.\nAnd according to Zoopla, there is a \u00c2\u00a31.72m difference in average property prices.\nHomes that share a postcode with London's 10 Downing Street are worth on average \u00c2\u00a31.8m.

He looked a long way from his usual brilliance - but he was not alone as buoyant Bayern took control of proceedings.\nOn a pitch that showed signs of being heavily watered, Bayern gave Barca a taste of their own medicine with a high-intensity pressing game aided by the confidence of an outstanding season in which the Bundesliga was secured on 6 April, the earliest it has ever been won.\nBayern should have been ahead inside two minutes when Robben, perhaps selfishly, chose to shoot and saw his effort blocked by visiting goalkeeper Victor Valdes with both Gomez and Franck Ribery pleading for the pass in perfect positions.\nThe opening goal had been coming and it duly arrived after 25 minutes. Dante's header from Robben's cross was off target but the opportunist Muller arrived at the far post to score, despite Valdes making good contact.\nEven though the Spanish side were struggling for rhythm, Barcelona's quality meant danger was never far away. And so it proved as it took a crucial touch from Dante to take Dani Alves' delivery away from the lurking Messi.\nBut Bayern's spirits rose further four minutes after half-time when they added a second. Valdes was uncertain from Robben's corner and, when Mueller headed back, the arch-poacher Gomez turned in as Barcelona appealed in vain for offside.\nBayern's work-rate and power had restricted Barcelona's attack to few dangerous moments, but there was anxiety for the home crowd when Marc Bartra found space eight yards out only to poke his finish straight at home keeper Manuel Neuer.\nThe German champions were coming at Barcelona in waves and extended their advantage further as the lively Robben worked his way into the area to score from an angle, although there seemed to be a clear case for an infringement as Mueller blocked off Jordi Alba.\nBarcelona's agony was not over yet as Mueller applied another of those trademark close-range finishes from David Alaba's cross to give Bayern an advantage of such command it is difficult to see how it can be retrieved.\nFull Time   The referee brings the game to a close.\nArjen Robben has a curled shot.

Port 25 is typically reserved for email, so blocking it could be a way to stop hijacked PCs sending messages via this route.\nAbout 80% of the billions of junk mail messages sent every day are believed to travel through hijacked PCs.\nAccording to statistics drawn up by security firm Sophos, South Korea is the second biggest source of spam in the world.\nInstead of using port 25, Korea wants all email to travel via official mail servers to block spam and help spot infected PCs.\nA spokesman for the Korean government told the BBC that it was continuing to lobby ISPs to adopt its plan which it wants to be up and working in December.\nJasper Kim, a law professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, said the block could have unforeseen consequences.\n\"No one likes spam mail,\" he said. \"But the anti-spam measures can be viewed as a form of cyber-censorship that could have a disproportionately negative effect on small players - the very type of players needed to create a Seoul-style Silicon Valley.\"\nA national block could also hit businesses that make legitimate use of port 25, said James Blessing, a council member of the UK's Internet Service Providers' Association.\n\"Many corporate mail servers run authenticated access through port 25,\" he said. \"If you want to connect to that you won't be able to if you block port 25. You'll stop people working from home.\"\nFar better, said Mr Blessing, was to tackle the problem at source and make greater efforts to ensure PCs were not hijacked by spammers in the first place.\nAlso, he added, criminals who use PCs to send junk mail will probably bypass the block completely by using a different port.\n\"Blocks do not solve the problem,\" he said. \"They just move it around.\"", "Media playback is unsupported on your device\n3 June 2015 Last updated at 11:00 BST\nIt has been out of operation for two years while the massive machine was upgraded.\nThis animation comes courtesy of Cern, the European nuclear research organisation that runs the LHC.\nIt shows \"bunches\" of protons circulating in the collider's 27km main ring and colliding within its four big experiments - Alice, LHCb, CMS and Atlas.", "Almost devoid of vegetation, this tiny remnant of a prehistoric volcano looks like a hulk of nothingness.\nThis is Antigua and Barbuda's third island, the one you will not find in tourist brochures. It could not be further from the lush landscapes fringed by white-sand beaches that helped put its sisters on the map.\nRedonda, stretching just one mile (1.6km) long, is entirely uninhabited save for a handful of conservationists, who are currently camping here. And some perplexed-looking goats which, until February, had the island to themselves for decades.\nIt may seem uninspiring at first glance but environmentalists hope to transform its barren terrain into a fertile eco-haven.\nIts desolate appearance belies its status as prized seabird habitat, home to rare and unique wildlife found nowhere else on Earth.\nYet these reptiles, tropical birds, frigates and boobies have been in danger of disappearing thanks to two invasive species introduced by early colonists.\nThe long-horned goats, brought here 300 years ago, have eaten almost all the plants that once carpeted Redonda. Now with barely anything left for them to feed on, many have starved to death, their carcasses littering the land.\nConservationists hope that by re-homing the 75-strong herd on to the main island of Antigua, around 30 miles (50km) away, Redonda will be able to flourish once again.\nSeveral have already been flown out by helicopter. To keep them calm on the 20-minute flight, shower caps or hoods made from yoga pants are put on their heads. Protective material, which actually comes from swimming floats known as noodles, is wrapped around their horns so they do not injure each other.\nToday, half a dozen more are in a corral awaiting embarkation to the mainland. The government's department of agriculture plans to breed them for their useful, drought-adapted genes.\nAlso in conservationists' targets are thousands of black rats, which they plan to eradicate. The rodents arrived with a 19th-Century guano-mining community and have come to prey on wildlife, eating precious birds' eggs.\nFor the handful of international non-governmental organisations at work here, in conjunction with the Antiguan government and the country's Environmental Awareness Group, Redonda is something of a giant outdoor laboratory.\n\"We will be watching to see what grows when all the goats and rats are gone,\" Elizabeth Bell, of Wildlife Management International Ltd, tells the BBC. \"In Columbus's day, Redonda would have been completely covered with ficus trees. In five to 10 years, I think we will see reasonably interesting changes. Within 100, there will be massive change.\"\nShe said her ideal scenario would be to see it \"fully forested again, with a larger population of boobies and frigate birds, lizards everywhere, and a massive increase in ground birds\".\nThe island is also home to an endemic pygmy gecko, a species that was only discovered in 2012.\nThe team eventually hopes to reintroduce long-departed iguanas and burrowing owls too.\nUnder international conservation protocol, it takes two years before the island can be declared a rat-free zone. The painstaking eradication project involves laying rat bait, flavoured with everything from liquorice to chocolate, in every crevice. The spots hardest to reach are accessed by abseiling and snorkelling.\nRedonda's dramatic deforestation has also triggered soil erosion and landslides threatening nearby coral reefs, says Shanna Challenger, a coordinator of the $700,000 (\u00a3540,000), three-year programme.\nSalina Janzan, from Surrey in the UK, is one of several environmentalists camping out among the relics of stone buildings left over from the guano miners.\nShe said she had accepted the challenge to come as part of a delegation from the Fauna & Flora International (FFI) charity, partly because she had read a children's book called The Dragon of Redonda about the island when she was young.\n\"What do I miss most?\" she says, with a grin. \"A cold drink. In fact, anything cold. And proper showers. This is the longest anyone has lived on Redonda in decades.\"\nEccentric though it may sound, this is not the first time a project of this kind has been undertaken.\nFFI says it has already eliminated black rats from 23 Caribbean islands since 1995, including 15 of Antigua & Barbuda's offshore isles. The work is believed to have saved the Antiguan racer, once the world's rarest known snake, from imminent extinction.\n\"Redonda is a pretty incredible place, both for the human history and the natural history,\" Ms Bell adds. \"To be working to make it even more special is magical.\"", "Matthew McDermott is accused of assaulting Niall Grace, who plays for Institute Football Club, at 00:45 BST on Sunday.\nMr Grace remains in a critical condition in hospital.\nMr McDermott, from Cornshell Fields in the city, is accused of grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of the Class A drug ecstasy.\nA police officer said he could connect the defendant to the charges.\nA defence barrister said a fight between the victim and the defendant outside a city centre bar had been caught on CCTV.\nShe said it showed both men throwing a punch before the victim fell and hit his head on the pavement.\nLondonderry Magistrates Court was told Mr Grace was taken to Altlagelvin hospital before being transferred to Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital, where he was placed in an induced coma.\nRemanding Mr McDermott in custody, the judge said said there were potential safety concerns, given the public reaction to the case.\nInstitute FC has expressed support for Mr Grace in a tweet, saying the club's \"thoughts and prayers\" were with him.\nIn another message of support on Twitter, Harland and Wolff Welders football club said: \"Our thoughts are with Niall Grace and the wider @Institute_FC family and hope Niall makes a full and speedy recovery from his injuries.\"", "Katie Davis, of Dorset, said she had been turned down despite submitting more than 100 documents, including bank statements, contracts and invoices.\nShe said maintaining her website and social media took hours, but she worked around looking after her baby daughter.\nWorking regular hours is essential for claiming the benefit, HMRC states.\nThe government department has been contacted for comment.\nAs a single parent, Ms Davis has to work for at least 16 hours per week to be eligible for working tax credits, which are worth up to \u00c2\u00a32,010 per year, according to its website.\nSelf-employed people who do not work regularly are not able to apply, the site adds.\n\"I am working far more than that, but it's not permanently paid work -

I was also clear there should be no subversion of the Barnett rules, and that hasn't happened.\"\nMr Mundell added: \"I always argue for resources and funds for Scotland and the most important argument that I've made consistently over the years is that the Barnett formula should continue, and that's the difference between myself and the SNP.\n\"Only a year ago the SNP were arguing that we should give up the Barnett formula and that we should have full fiscal autonomy which would've cost Scotland billions.\"\nDowning Street has insisted the Barnett formula does not apply to the new money as it is provided as an addition to the Northern Ireland executive's block grant.\nThe Barnett system concerns any additional spend by the UK government in England on matters devolved to other parliaments, and the Conservatives insist this is not triggered by the deal.\nA spokesman for the UK government said: \"We are clear this is about delivering for the whole of the UK - so we can get on with our plan to get the best Brexit deal for our country and create an economy that works for everyone.\n\"Like previous Northern Ireland support packages, and city deals in Scotland and Wales, this funding is a targeted intervention to address a specific set of unique challenges. It is not unprecedented, the UK government has always been able to provide funding outside of Barnett.\"", "Georginio Wijnaldum's soaring eighth-minute header from Adam Lallana's cross was enough to put Liverpool in second place and put a serious dent in City's own title challenge.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp led the celebrations at the end of a game that was high on energy but sadly lacking in any moments of genuine quality.\nCity, who laboured throughout, improved in the second half but never seriously threatened Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and this loss leaves them 10 points adrift of Chelsea.\nThis was the first Premier League meeting between two huge personalities straight from the top tier of management - and it brought a victory for Jurgen Klopp to cherish at Pep Guardiola's expense.\nThe head-to-head was locked at 4-4 after their meetings in Germany with Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich. This was a different stage with different prizes on offer - but it was an occasion that was just as charged.\nKlopp, in 15 months, has revitalised Liverpool and given hope to supporters longing to end the wait for a first title since 1990. And as they continue their pursuit of relentless Chelsea, belief continues to grow that the charismatic German can still haul in Antonio Conte's side.\nLiverpool's manager was, as usual, celebrating with his players after the final whistle before pumping his chest in mock relief in front of Anfield's huge new Main Stand.\nAnd, when City fleetingly threatened a second-half comeback, he turned cheerleader in front of those same fans with a demand to lift the noise levels that was met instantly.\nKlopp has become the new Anfield talisman. Under him, the transformation of his team and the mood around the club continues.\nSomething else that will give Liverpool's fans great heart is the way in which Klopp is getting results against his closest rivals.\nSince his appointment in October 2015, Klopp has faced a total of 13 Premier League games against Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. He has lost only one - a single goal defeat by United last season.\nHe has also enjoyed a Europa League win over two legs against United, although the balance is redressed slightly by a loss on penalties against Manchester City in last season's Capital One Cup final.\nLiverpool - and indeed Manchester City - are having to run to stand still in the Premier League title race, with Chelsea stretching their winning run to 13 games as they beat Stoke City earlier on Saturday.\nIt meant this was a game both sides needed to win - hence the contrasting emotions of Klopp and Guardiola at the final whistle.\nLiverpool are underdogs but six points is still a gap that can be closed and Chelsea have to visit Anfield on 31 January.\nKlopp's players have shown strength of character with their response to setbacks earlier this month, when they lost 4-3 at Bournemouth and drew 2-2 at home to West Ham.\nThey have also shown they can win in different ways. Recent victories over Middlesbrough and Stoke showcased a free-flowing style. At Everton and against City, they toughed it out - and answered questions about a supposedly vulnerable defence. It is evidence that Liverpool must be taken very seriously as title challengers.\nIt is far too early to dismiss a manager of Guardiola's ability - and a team of City's talents - in terms of the Premier League title race. However, the 10-point gap between themselves and Chelsea is starting to look as if it will only be overturned by extraordinary events.\nCity were too timid for too long here at Anfield. Sergio Aguero - returning after a four-match ban - was starved of service, while Kevin de Bruyne was marginalised and largely snuffed out by Liverpool's intense pressing style.\nIt was still David Silva who called the shots when they did put some moves together after the break but Yaya Toure could not exert serious influence.\nGuardiola's task should at least be put in context. City were a team short on inspiration and spark for much of last season under Manuel Pellegrini. Perhaps it was too much to expect even a manager of Guardiola's pedigree to apply an instant fix.\nCity should never be ruled out. But on the evidence of this flat performance - and the growing sense that significant renewal of the squad is still needed - dragging back Chelsea may be beyond them for this season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"I know everyone talks about our defence. It's not about avoiding goals - that's the end product - it's about how we work together.\n\"I think we have the smallest number of shots on our goal in the league. Tonight the concentration level was outstanding.\n\"I don't care about criticism of our defence. You always pick out things that aren't right but that's how goals are.\"\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola: \"It was an equal game. The goal made it difficult against a team who use the counter-attack like a master. The second half was much better.\n\"We have to wake up for another game. We need to focus and work - we can't think about the big goals.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nFormer England defender Phil Neville: \"It was a poor game. I was so disappointed by how poorly Manchester City passed the ball. They didn't get back into shape quick enough.\n\"Aleksandar Kolarov should have been winning that header against Georginio Wijnaldum. They were really poor in possession and well off the pace.

Remarkably he has led the party from London for over 20 years for fear that going back home could result in legal cases or a physical threat to his security.\nAs well as his solid electoral base in Karachi, Mr Hussain has a powerful party organisation in the city which is often accused of extorting money from businesses and using violence - or the threat of it - to get its way.\nFor years the British authorities tolerated the MQM being based in London. In fact British diplomats sought to take advantage of the situation by trying to influence the party to help achieve British objectives in Pakistan. But the mood changed when a senior MQM party member Imran Farooq was murdered in London in 2010.\nMr Hussain, his party, and some of his associates and relatives are currently the subject of a number of British investigations.\nOne is looking into the question of whether in his televised speeches he has incited violence in Pakistan, charges Mr Hussain denies. Another is into whether the MQM has paid its UK taxes correctly.\nThe most high-profile investigation followed the 2010 murder in London of a senior MQM leader Imran Farooq.

His first book of poetry was published in 1956.\nThe author was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1999, for portraying \"the forgotten face of history\".\nPraising The Tin Drum, the Nobel committee said that it was \"as if German literature had been granted a new beginning after decades of linguistic and moral destruction\".\nThe magical realist novel's narrator decides to stop growing at the age of three, and watches the adult world around him as events overtake his family and Danzig. He communicates through his tin drum and is able to \"drum up the past\", reporting on events he has not witnessed.\nGrass was politically engaged - campaigning for the Social Democratic Party - and was a major figure in German public life and discourse.\nA poem published in 2012, What Must Be Said, sparked controversy for its strong criticism of Israel, which barred the writer from the country.\nGrass was a deeply thoughtful and intelligent man who struggled, like many of his peers, to make sense of his and Germany's troubled past, according to the BBC's Arts Editor Will Gompertz.\nFor him, The Tin Drum is \"a strange and brilliant book\" that captured the nature of the 20th Century in a way few others have equalled.", "Red-headed Tracey Woodford, 47, was discovered at a flat in Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, in April.\nChristopher May, 50, denies murder at Cardiff Crown Court.\nA barmaid at the pub where the pair met said Mr May told her he \"loved redheads\" before Ms Woodford's death.\nThe court has heard Mr May strangled Ms Woodford before cutting up her body and placing her head in an underground storm drain.\nShe was last seen heading in the general direction of Mr May's flat in Andrew's Court, after the pair met at the town's Skinny Dog pub on 21 April.\nCerys Richards, 19, who works at the pub, said Mr May once came very close to her face before telling her redheads were \"perfect people, better than anyone else\".\n\"I thought it was strange, so I backed off and went to the other end of the bar,\" she said.\n\"It made me feel uncomfortable at the time.

And that indeed has been the official position of the Bank of England.\nWhy might the Bank want to change its official position and be less fearful of rate rises?\nWell, there are two reasons.\nOne is that \"only\" 57% of those with mortgages told the Bank of England that they would cut their spending if interest rates rose two percentage points.\nIn the survey of 6,000 households carried out for the Bank by NMG Consulting, some 35% said they would simply save less if rates rose 2%, while 24% said they would work more or find other ways to boost income from employment.\nAnd in bad news for the banks and building societies, 23% said they would request changes to their loans - which is another way of saying they would change the repayment profile to the detriment and cost of the lender.\nOr to put it another way, a rise in interest rates would potentially generate significant losses for banks, if the survey proves to be correct.\nThe second reason why a rise in interest rates might not stymie the economy is that savings have increased since the 2008 debacle. And if interest rates were to rise, savers' income would rise.\nHowever, the survey suggests that savers will spend just \u00a31 for every \u00a310 increase in their income, whereas borrowers will cut their spending by \u00a35 for every \u00a310 of their income drop.\nEven so, the Bank calculates that a 2% rise in interest rates would reduce spending by around 1% - which, apparently, is not massively out of whack with historical norms.\nAll of which is to say that the Bank does appear to be steeling itself for the effects of an interest rate rise, because it knows one is likely to be necessary next year - and maybe earlier than the autumn date anticipated by investors.\nNone of which is to play down the hardship for many people that may be caused by a rate increase.\nThere are still 4% of those with mortgages, little changed from last year, who pay out 40% or more of their gross income to service their debts. That is 360,000 people who are at significant risk of not being able to keep up the payments - and who have precious little money left after shelling out for interest and principal.\nThat is 1.2% of all households, which - as it happens - is very much at the low end of where this measure of financial distress has been since 1991.\nBut UK households are still very indebted by all historical standards. The share of households with a mortgage debt-to-income ratio above 3 is still high by historical standards, at 5.8%, compared with less than 3% during most of the 1990's. But that proportion of fairly highly indebted households has come down from a peak of 7.64% in 2011.\nSo how can debt distress be relatively low? Well, it is because - as if you need telling - interest rates have been at record lows since March 2009.\nOne important question, therefore, is what would happen to the number of people in financial distress if interest rates were to rise?\nWell, the Bank tries to answer this question for a two percentage-point rise in rates, combined with a 10% rise in income for all households or a 0% rise in income for all households.\nBy the way, there is no magic to the 2% assumption. Interest rates may rise by more than this or less than this over the next two to three years.\nBut given the sheer magnitude of debts bearing down on the UK economy, it is reasonable to assume that the Bank of England would not wish to raise interest rates by more than two percentage points over the coming few years, for fear of mullering us all.\nSo here is the thing.\nIf the income of households were to rise 10% before the rate rise, the proportion of those in distress would rise by 50%, from 1.2% of households to 1.8% of households.\nAnd the actual number in this vulnerable category would rise from 360,000 households to approximately 500,000 (I know these numbers aren't consistent - but there is lots of rounding of numbers and percentages going on at the Bank).\nWhich is a big increase in financial pain. But even 1.8% of households classified as vulnerable would not be particularly high by recent standards.\nThat said, the proportion in this distressed group would increase to 2.4% of households, in the scenario of interest rates rising without a prior increase in incomes. And 2.4% would be a high proportion in distress by historical standards.\nNow it is unlikely that the Bank would raise interest rates by 2% if incomes had not risen in general.\nHowever, the most vulnerable households are those that are most pessimistic about their wage and salary prospects.\nAnd if they happen to be in low or intermediate skilled employment, or part-time employment, they may be right to be pessimistic - since prospects for earnings growth in this part of the labour market are widely seen as depressed.\nAll of which suggests that interest rate rises, as and when they come, may not destroy the economic recovery, but they may wreck the lives of many families.", "House of Representatives Majority Whip Steve Scalise was one of five injured in the early morning ambush at a park in Alexandria, Virginia.\nThe attacker, identified as Illinois native James T Hodgkinson, 66, was killed after a firefight with police.\nThe injured included two officers with non-life-threatening wounds.\nHodgkinson was self-employed until recently and worked as a home inspector.\nHe had campaigned for former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\nA Facebook account that appears to belong to Hodgkinson is filled with anti-Republican and anti-Trump posts.\nMr Sanders, a Vermont senator, said he was \"sickened by this despicable act\" and condemned Hodgkinson's actions.\nPresident Trump described the attack as a \"very, very brutal assault\".\n\"We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country,\" he added.\nThe president visited Mr Scalise - who was shot in the left hip and is in a critical condition after surgery - at the MedStar Washington Hospital Center on Wednesday evening, describing him as a \"patriot and a fighter\".\nThe hospital said Mr Scalise had suffered fractured bones, internal organ injuries and severe bleeding and would require further operations.\nWhat we know about James T Hodgkinson\nThe lawmakers were practising for the annual congressional ballgame that organisers vowed would go ahead as planned on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of Major League Baseball team the Washington Nationals.\nAlexandria police said the FBI was taking over the investigation into the shooting, which began shortly after 07:00 (11:00 GMT) on Wednesday morning at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park.\nAs well as Mr Scalise, two police officers who protect him, Krystal Griner and David Bailey, lobbyist Matt Mika and Zack Barth, a congressional aide for Texas lawmaker Roger Williams, were injured.\nMr Barth, a former staffer for two Republican congressmen, was shot in the chest, according to witness Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.\nMr Flake told reporters he was at bat during the shooting and the victims were \"sitting ducks\".\nSenator Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, said someone at the baseball field had used a belt as a tourniquet on Mr Scalise, who is the number three House Republican.\nSouth Carolina congressman Jeff Duncan said the suspect had asked him whether Republicans or Democrats were practising, before shots rang out.\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul told Fox News: \"I do believe without the Capitol Hill police it would have been a massacre.\n\"We had no defence at all.

Figures suggest one or two in 100,000 athletes die in this way each year.\nNo-one knows why this increased risk exists, though some suggest extensive exercise can sometimes put strain on heart muscles, causing them to enlarge.\nBut predicting which athletes will be affected is not easy.\nDr Paulo Adami from the Institute of Sport Medicine and Science of the Italian Olympic Committee, studied athletes shortlisted for the Olympic games between 2004 and 2014.\nTests included ECG tests (recordings the electrical activity of their hearts) both at rest and while doing exercise and ultrasound scans of their hearts.\nThey picked up worrying signs in 300 athletes.\nAnd after further investigations they found six with potentially life-threatening conditions which meant they could no longer compete.\nSome 165 were allowed to continue their careers with annual checks.\nBut more than 100 individuals identified as at risk on the initial set of tests were dismissed as having spurious results or changes that were unlikely to lead to problems later.\nDr Adami said: \"We cannot take it for granted that elite athletes are healthy.\n\"This study demonstrates that a more accurate assessment is necessary for elite professional athletes than for members of the general population, in view of the intensity and stress on their cardiovascular system.\n\"We suggest that our model of screening is applied to all elite athletes, regardless of the sport they practise.\"\nDr Michael Knapton at the British Heart Foundation is hopeful that screening will one day be very useful for athletes.\nBut for now he argues it is not reliable enough to be offered widely.\nHe said: \"We would have to screen an awful lot of people to save one life and in most of those people it might do more harm than good.\n\"We could end up stopping ambitious young athletes from following their careers and worry them for no reason.\n\"We might also falsely reassure people that they are fine when they are not.\"\nBut he says the case is different for people known to be at high risk - for example families with genetic conditions that predispose them to sudden death.\nFor these individuals the BHF supports tailored assessments by the NHS.\nSome organisations already offer screening to all young people and athletes.\nAnd the BHF says more people need to be aware of what to do if someone has a cardiac arrest in a public space.\nCPR - cardiopulmonary resuscitation - involving chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth can help restart the heart in some cases.\nMeanwhile the UK national screening committee is reviewing the evolving evidence behind cardiac screening.", "James Rawlings, born at Ipswich Hospital, was just 18 days old when he died at home in May last year.\nAn inquest in Ipswich heard that despite the concerns of a midwife and the mother Jo Rawlings, Dr Lovelina Das delayed a Caesarean delivery.\nThe hearing was told that Dr Das no longer worked at the hospital.\nThe hospital trust said it had been unable to contact Dr Das, who is believed to be working abroad.\nThe trust admitted that if James had been delivered earlier, he would probably have survived.\nMrs Rawlings praised the midwife for her support.\nGreater Suffolk coroner Peter Dean concluded that James died from a lack of oxygen and sepsis.\n\"The evidence shows that had James been delivered earlier he would not have died on May 16,\" said Dr Dean\nMr and Mrs Rawlings now have a new eight-week-old son called Joshua.", "The exact cause of death is not clear but he suffered from liver problems, his wife Tekla Hove told the BBC.\nMr Hove was known as a critic of President Robert Mugabe and went into self-imposed exile in 2001 after harassment from the authorities.\nHe won several awards for his work and was regarded as a leading figure in post-colonial literature in Zimbabwe.\nMr Hove's wife and sister were with him when he died -

At first, Mr Snowden seemed committed to staying in Hong Kong and fighting against extradition through local courts.\nBut soon, reality sank in.\nMr Snowden's lawyers told him it was very possible that he might be in jail throughout the lengthy legal proceedings. At the very least, his freedom and activities would be curtailed.\nMr Snowden asked his lawyers to reach out to the Hong Kong government to get a sense of how he might be treated. Mr Ho said he had a meeting with officials last Friday, which yielded no answers.\nSomewhere around that time, a message was delivered to Mr Snowden through one of his supporters, purportedly by a person who claimed government status. Mr Ho said that person urged Mr Snowden to leave, and assured him that he would not be arrested if he left his safe house.\nUnsure about the person's credibility, Mr Snowden asked Mr Ho to confirm the message with the Hong Kong government. Mr Ho said he made a phone call to a senior Hong Kong official, which again yielded no answers.\nBy this time, the US had made public the charges against Mr Snowden. He was feeling the heat.\nMr Ho said Mr Snowden at first intended to leave Hong Kong for Moscow on Saturday night. For some reason, perhaps because Mr Ho had made no progress with the Hong Kong official, he hesitated.\nBut by Sunday, Mr Snowden was ready to leave. Again, Mr Man accompanied him.\nTogether, they went to the airport. Mr Ho said Mr Snowden was uncharacteristically nervous on that journey.\nMr Man watched as Mr Snowden checked in and walked through airport security like any other passenger.\nMr Ho now believes the message delivered to Mr Snowden asking him to leave came from the Beijing government. The Hong Kong government has not responded to a BBC request for comment.\nMr Ho, a pro-democracy lawmaker who was a candidate for chief executive last year, says a long extradition hearing in Hong Kong would have damaged Sino-US relations and embarrassed China.\nBut at the same time, it was in Beijing's interest to ensure Mr Snowden remained a free man, still able to leak US government secrets.", "An investigation into The Rising Moon on New Road, Porthcawl, was launched by Bridgend county council after a zero hygiene rating sticker was not displayed.\nOwner Na Shi pleaded guilty at Bridgend Magistrates Court to 12 food hygiene offences, from March 2015.\nThe court was told the hygiene rating has since risen to two out of a possible five.\nOfficers visited after Mr Shi failed to display a zero rating sticker that showed urgent improvements were required.\nProblems included cooked pork defrosting in dirty warm water that was heavily contaminated with food debris and grease, while staff were using dirty scourers.\nCooked rice was also being kept in dirty food containers, with \"a multitude\" of food hygiene failings which posed a \"serious risk of food poisoning\".\nMr Shi was fined \u00a31,800, with costs and fees taking the total to \u00a34,724.\nCouncillor Charles Smith said: \"What makes this case particularly concerning is the fact that officers visited twice within 48 hours yet the owner failed to act on the advice given to improve the hygiene of his premises.\"", "Walter Groom and another man became the only two inmates to escape from HMP Shrewsbury when they broke out in 1961.\nMr Groom, who was serving time for breaking into shops, said the pair went down a manhole and tunnel before making \"a human ladder\" to scale the wall.\nThe 81-year-old told his story visitors to the former jail, known as the Dana, during a history day.\nHMP Shrewsbury dates from the 19th Century and closed in 2013.\nMr Groom, of Bilston, said the plan was hatched after he was approached by the other man \"who was desperate to get out\".\nThey planned the escape for 16 days after realising a manhole led into the prison yard, but they were both recaptured six days later.\nMr Groom, whose wife Barbara has written a book about his experiences, said he later put his criminal past behind him.\n\"I wanted to make a new life for myself - I always wanted to do that and I succeeded in the end.

In total, 2,887 people were approved to buy a gun over the weekend, an increase of 43.5% on the weekend before, said the bureau.\nThe bureau's figures cannot confirm how many people then bought a firearm, but gun shop owners also reported a rise in sales.\nDick Rutan, owner of Gunners Den in the Colorado town of Arvada, said sales were \"off the hook\".\n\"What they're saying is, 'they want to have a chance',\" he told the Denver Post. \"They want to have the ability to protect themselves and their families if they are in a situation like what happened in the movie theatre.\"\nAn employee at Mr Baker's shop, Jake Meyers, said there had been up to 20 people waiting outside when he arrived at work on the day after the shooting.\n\"A lot of it is people saying, 'I didn't think I needed a gun, but now I do',\" the Denver Post quoted him as saying. \"When it happens in your backyard, people start reassessing, 'Hey, I go to the movies'.\"\nBrandon Baker, who owns the Rocky Mountain Guns & Ammo in the town of Parker, only 15 miles (24km) from Aurora said his sales had gone up, as had requests for firearms training.\nThe Associated Press news agency said sales were also up in other states, including Florida, which recorded a 14% rise from the previous week, and Oregon, where July's sales were up by 11% over June. Background checks in the days after the shooting were up 10% in Florida compared with the same period last month.\nLaw officials said gun sales had risen after previous significant events, including the election of President Barack Obama and the shooting in Arizona which killed six people and injured Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords in January 2011.\nThis is often attributed to fears that a mass killing could prompt the government to reconsider the Second Amendment to the US constitution, which gives people the right to bear arms.\nA small group of Democratic lawmakers in Washington renewed calls on Tuesday to ban high-capacity gun magazines.

Even those involving more work shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes.\nThe system is automated, so the ratings should be spat out shortly after the answers are punched in.\nHowever, Iarc promises there will be manual checks of the most popular apps and any which receive complaints from customers.\n\"The volume of apps in a storefront like Google Play is just enormous,\" explained Pegi's Dirk Bosmans.\n\"We can't follow the same [hands-on] approach that we do for boxed games, but we don't have to make the process as robust as there's no physical product here.\n\"If a physical product is mis-rated that's a logistical nightmare as you have to pull the boxes back from the shops and reprint them.\n\"With apps you can just say, 'That age seven rating should have been a 12,' and with a snap of the finger, reprogramme it.\"\nActually, Google Play isn't the first to throw its lot in with Iarc.\nMozilla's lesser-used Firefox Marketplace already depends on its rankings.\nAnd the body says Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo are also set to join.\nIarc would love to take over the iOS store's age ratings and says it has discussed the possibility with the iPhone-maker.\nBut for now, Apple has opted to retain its own system.\nThat could potentially be confusing for families using a mix of devices.\nFor example, Apple's guidelines state that an app depicting mild occurrences of cartoon-like violence should get a nine+ rating, but the ESRB allows the same type of product to be classed E, meaning suitable for everyone.\nLikewise, Apple says apps including nudity should be limited to a 17+ audience, while Pegi says nudity is fine for the 3+ crowd if it's non-sexual and 16+ if erotic.\nApple declined to comment about its future plans.\nNot quite.\nThe ratings are limited to an app's content and don't involve privacy issues.\nSo, Iarc's members would judge a storybook app, for instance, to be suitable for a pre-teen age group based solely on the innocuous plot it tells.\nBut it could still be problematic if it required the user to share data about their location, contacts, photos or other device use.\nThis is a real concern. Earlier this month, 29 privacy watchdogs across the globe announced they were investigating what information was being collected by some of the leading apps targeted at children because of fears that too much personal information was being recorded.\nApps containing user generated content that isn't moderated before publication pose a separate challenge.\nThe ESRB plans to give such products a \"teen\" rating, while Pegi will instead show an exclamation mark icon, indicating that further parental guidance is necessary.\nYes. But there are proposals to change this.\nSome campaigners are pressing for an age-verification scheme that would let app stores confirm that young device-owners were old enough to download a product without needing to hold personal information about them on file.\nThis would involve a trusted third party carrying out the necessary ID checks and then vouching for the child's age at the point of purchase, explains Dr Rachel O'Connell, chief executive of the tech advisory service Trust Elevate.\nIf the child was flagged as being below Iarc's relevant age rating, she said, an email could be automatically sent to their parents asking for their permission.\nWhile it might take years to get such an initiative up and running, the GSMA - which represents mobile operators - says other steps could be taken in the meantime.\nIt suggests age-restricted apps could pose children a series of challenging questions to try to catch out those attempting to pretend to be older than they are - such as requiring them to type in their date of birth - and only giving them one chance to get the answer right.\nThere are also existing parental control apps and settings in Android Lollipop that can be used to prevent unauthorised access to the marketplace and only allow children access to specific titles.", "Mike Hopkins, 56, who returned home safely on Saturday, had reached Camp 1 when the 7.8 magnitude tremor struck.\nIt sparked a devastating avalanche on a section of the mountain he had been due to climb.\n\"A day in a different place and it could have been us, sometimes that's how luck goes\" he said.\nMr Hopkins was with with a group of nine other climbers and Sherpas on the north side of Everest.\nDescribing the moment the earthquake hit, he said: \"We were all sitting in the tent and all of a sudden the whole thing was moving.\n\"It was a weird sensation, I have never come across anything like it in my life.\n\"We were told to evacuate and as we were evacuating we were coming down the mountain getting aftershocks.\n\"Big rocks were coming down either side of us.

And his message was carried out to the letter in the opening exchanges as England played with a tempo and threat Montenegro struggled to subdue.\nTheo Walcott's final pass has often drawn criticism but there could be no complaint in the 11th minute when his perfect delivery to the far post only required a stoop and a nod of the head from Young to put England ahead.\nCapello can now turn his attention to next summer, but only the wildest optimist would study England's body of work and their squad and predict success in the face of competition from the likes of Spain, Holland and Italy\nRead Phil McNulty's blog from Podgorica\nAnd with the sting drawn from Montenegro's gifted attacking players and thunder and lightning crackling around the small but atmospheric arena, England's rain-soaked fans were celebrating a second goal after 31 minutes.\nBent was again left with the simplest of finishes when Rooney picked out Young and he unselfishly crossed for Bent to tap in from inside the six-yard area.\nEven then the perfectionist Capello was not happy, almost dancing in his technical area in fury when Gareth Barry wasted possession, constantly urging England to maintain the tempo that saw them take such a measure of command.\nJust as a satisfactory 45 minutes looked to be drawing to a close without further incident, England conceded a sloppy goal with the last act of the half. Fatos Beciraj was allowed time and space to find Zverotic, whose shot took a crucial deflection off Gary Cahill's boot and out of Joe Hart's reach.\nIn a single moment Montenegro and their supporters were given fresh impetus and encouragement. Beciraj tested Hart with a low shot before teenager Phil Jones, on his England debut, suffered an anxious moment when Stevan Jovetic went down under his challenge, leaving the youngster clearly relieved to see referee Stark wave away Montenegro's appeals.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nCapello made a change on the hour which was presumably enforced by injury as the excellent Young was replaced by Stewart Downing. And four minutes later Bent went off to allow Frank Lampard to come on and restore England's earlier midfield superiority.\nAs England attempted to steady the ship, the Rooney flashpoint occurred 17 minutes from time. He was involved in little more than a routine battle for possession near the touchline before lashing out at Dzudovic.\nDzudovic made the most of the offence but Rooney could have no complaints when he was shown a red card.\nThe final twist came with that late equaliser.

Zouma's headed clearance landed at the feet of Ibraimi, whose sumptuous curling shot found the top corner of Cech's goal.\nAfter Costa blazed high and wide, Chelsea were given a huge let-off at the other end when Zahovic side-footed over the bar from three yards after a perfect cross from left-back Viler.\nWith 20 minutes remaining, the visitors were denied a penalty when Oscar appeared to be tripped by his fellow Brazilian Arghus.\nChelsea's sense of grievance was short-lived. From a Fabregas corner, Terry's downward header presented Matic with the simplest of tap-ins to equalise.\nAs the Blues pushed hard for a winner, Handanovic made superb saves to deny Hazard and Costa, who then had a goal ruled out for offside.\nBut Maribor stayed in the game and almost snatched it when Tavares slashed Jean-Philippe Mendy's square pass wide of goal.\nIn the 85th minute, the outstanding Hazard was tripped by Viler in the box, but Handanovic dived to his left to keep it out and secure a famous point.\nMatch ends, NK Maribor 1, Chelsea 1.\nSecond Half ends, NK Maribor 1, Chelsea 1.\nSubstitution, NK Maribor.

And she was the author of \"this metamorphosis\" that had \"transformed the FN into a possible party of government\".\nL\u00c3\u00a9vy's prediction was prescient. In the 2017 presidential election Marine Le Pen reached the run-off with a new record of just under 7.7 million votes. She was also set to race past the 17.8% of the vote her father, Jean-Marie, took in 2002, when the far right last reached the second round.\nHer strategy of \"detoxification\" of the party image since she wrested the leadership from her father, a convicted racist, in 2011 seems to have been effective.\nPolls suggest the FN now has a realistic chance to seize power in France.\nBorn the youngest of Jean-Marie Le Pen's three daughters in 1968, she was eight years old when the family flat in Paris was blown up in a bomb attack, though nobody was hurt.\nIt was 1972, four years after her father had founded the National Front.\nMore trauma was to come when she was 16 and her mother Pierrette ran off with the man writing Jean-Marie Le Pen's biography.\nJean-Marc Simon, Marine Le Pen's biographer, says: \"[The] brutal departure of the mother was a drama for Marine.\n\"She was only 16 and very close to her mother - they had the same rhythm, they cooked together, she followed her as much as possible. So there's a huge psychological rupture there.\"\nMarine Le Pen: Is France's National Front leader far right?\nFrench election 2017: Why is it important?\nDoes Le Pen have a chance of winning French presidency?\nThat abandonment was to bring Marine much closer to her father, says Mr Simon.\nThe youngest daughter became steeped in politics from a young age, accompanying her father to meetings and rallies.\nShe first campaigned with him when she was 13 years old.\nBut their relationship would turn sour decades later in a very public feud that threatened to plunge the party into crisis.\nThe rift was laid bare after Mr Le Pen gave a radio interview in April 2015 in which he repeated an old anti-Semitic slur that the Nazi gas chambers were \"a detail of history\".\nHis daughter denounced his comments and he was expelled from the FN in August 2015.\nMarine Le Pen had trained as a lawyer at one of France's top law schools.\nShe signed up as a public defender who would take any case where the defendant could not afford a lawyer.\nThat meant acting at times for illegal immigrants, something some of her rivals in the FN have held against her.\nParis barrister Basile Ader, who faced Ms Le Pen across the courtroom on occasion, remembers her as \"a good lawyer [who] worked hard, did her homework and was on top of things\".\n\"I admired how she kept her cool and was able to maintain normal professional relationships despite being burdened with the notoriety of her father.\"\nIn 1998, she ceased practising and became the head of the FN's legal department.\nAfter years of fighting and losing French parliamentary elections, she was elected to the European parliament in 2004 and remains an MEP, representing North-West France.\nWith her two divorces, steely femininity and cigarette-roughened voice, the mother-of-three comes across as far more \"normal\" than most of her political rivals, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield.\nAfter taking over as leader in 2011, she based her approach on emphasising threats to the French way of life.\nThe fight against \"Islamification\" was still high on the party's agenda - but so were its campaigns against globalisation, the EU and the euro.\nA more liberal stance on social issues, including women's issues and gay rights, gave the party fresh appeal to hitherto hostile voters.\nIn the 2012 presidential election, Ms Le Pen came third, but with a higher percentage of the vote than her father got in 2002.\nIn European elections in 2014, the FN topped the polls - the party's first victory in a national election.\nAnd as the run-off round drew near in 2017, Marine Le Pen was polling at about 40%, still well short of Emmanuel Macron, but power now appeared within sight.\nWhen she stepped aside temporarily as leader of the FN, to show she could be a leader of all French people not just her party, her critics dismissed the move as a stunt.\nMs Le Pen has objected to the use of the term \"far right\", arguing that it marginalises a party with significant support.\nShe emphasises the fact that the party today has grown to include Jewish and Muslim members.\nNonetheless, for some analysts - and many anti-FN protesters - behind the softer exterior, the FN's policies remain extreme.\n\"French citizenship should be either inherited or merited,\" Ms Le Pen has declared, vowing to end free education for children of undocumented migrants.\nShe reverted to a hard line during the 2017 presidential campaign, pledging an immediate suspension of all legal migration in an apparent bid to shore up grassroots support.\nBut many of her ideas have become more mainstream, such as her campaign to bring back France's old currency, the franc.", "Ben Staff, 35, resigned from Norfolk Police in 2008 but used his connections to gain his victims' trust, Norwich Crown Court heard.\nHe then used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle.\nSentencing Staff, Judge Mark Dennis QC described his actions as \"thoroughly dishonest conduct\".\nStaff, of Lucas Court, Norwich, bought cars and holidays, renovated his home and paid for his wedding.\nThe court heard how he directed payments intended for his building and development companies into his personal accounts, gave creditors cheques that bounced and fraudulently claimed VAT refunds.\nStaff was found guilty of eight fraud-related charges at two previous trials.\nHis wife, Catriona Staff, 33, also a police officer, was also charged in both trials but cleared on all counts.\nShe now faces internal disciplinary procedures.\nJudge Dennis said Staff had \"continually fobbed people off\".\n\"You were dealing with honest and hardworking individuals who were acting in the same difficult financial climate that you faced,\" he told him.\n\"You slipped into a selfish habit of dishonesty which became your default position.\"\nDavid Wilson, prosecuting, said it was \"sophisticated\" fraud and that Staff attempted to blame professionals such as accountants.\nJudge Dennis disqualified Staff from holding a directorship for 10 years.

Its recommendation has been followed by the UK and the devolved governments.\nBut this year the recommendation of a 1% rise by the PRB was rejected by the UK and Welsh governments. It was accepted in Scotland.\nThere's already been strike action in England but it was suspended in Wales on Monday after the Welsh government put forward a two year offer. No such negotiation is happening in England.\nI'm told Mark Drakeford has found around \u00c2\u00a325m to put together an offer that includes a 1% rise next year. He's also going to bring in the living wage for the lowest paid workers in January.\nThat means laundry workers and hospitals porters, for example, will no longer be earning less than \u00c2\u00a37.85 an hour.\nThe 1% and the living wage are not being offered in England.\nWhat's happening in England is that those at the top of their pay bands in the NHS are being offered cash payments. It's been rejected by the unions and the situation remains unresolved.\nUnions don't like cash payments, they prefer consolidated pay rises because a 1% pay rise is permanent, as opposed to a cash payment which is a one-off.\nThe unions are faced by a paradox: they are wedded to UK-agreements on pay because it's a fundamental belief for them that they're stronger together and easier to pick off if they become fragmented into the devolved nations.\nBut at the same time they find the cuts imposed by the Conservative-led coalition at Westminster unpalatable.\nThe key question will be whether they will call for the permanent devolution of pay if David Cameron is back in Number 10 after the general election.\nAnd it's an interesting one for the Welsh government as well which will now be entering the tortuous world of public sector pay negotiations for the first time.\nIt's the nature of the beast that on the first occasion it puts together a Wales-only deal it's immediately embroiled in a dispute.\nThere's an enormous test over the next week when the unions decide whether to accept the offer from Cardiff.\nHas a Pandora's box been opened up?\nEven if pay talks return to Westminster, the unions will now always be able to go to the Welsh government and ask it to intervene knowing that a precedent has been set.\nAnd what about the rest of the public sector? The teaching unions remain opposed to pay being devolved but attitudes appear to be softening in some quarters. The NUT has held informal talks on the issue with the Welsh government.\nThere is a case for saying that teachers' pay is more suitable to being devolved than health as the education system has become so different in Wales than in England.\nA final thought on health. The Welsh government is under intense pressure to invest more in the NHS. If you add pay into the equation, it will have to deal with the question of whether extra money for the NHS goes on wages or on medical resources.\nWith a workforce of around 80,000 in the Welsh NHS, it was no surprise that Mark Drakeford told Huw Edwards on the Wales Report on BBC One last night: \"The real money in the health service is always in staff.\"", "Emergency services were called to the scene on Abernethy Road, near Newburgh, just before 07:00.\nThe driver of a Volkswagen Golf was seriously injured and later died.\nTwo men in a Toyota Hilux were taken to Perth Royal Infirmary. The road is currently closed and police are appealing for witnesses to come forward.", "His predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, declined to meet the Bring Back Our Girls activists.\nMr Buhari promised them that troops for a regional force to fight the militants would be in place by the end of July.\nThe kidnap of the girls from a school in Chibok sparked global outrage.\nThe mass abduction sparked one of the biggest social media campaigns of 2014, with the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls being used more than five million times.\nBoko Haram has stepped up attacks since Mr Buhari took office in May vowing to tackle the insurgency \"head on\".\nIn the last week, more than 220 people have been killed in suspected militant attacks.\nThe Nigerian military has said it has arrested \"the mastermind\" behind two recent attacks on the northern towns of Jos and Zaria in which almost 70 people were killed.\nAddressing members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign group and the media, the president said that the government was doing all it could to tackle insecurity, but did not refer directly to the 219 Chibok girls abducted in April 2014.\nEarlier, the activists had marched through the capital, Abuja, on their way meet Mr Buhari at his official residence.\nOne of the founders of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign group told the BBC that \"there was no time left\" for the government to act.\n\"The rescue of the Chibok girls would be the strongest statement this government could make for having respect for the sanctity and dignity of every Nigerian life,\" said Oby Ezekwesili.\nIn his speech, Mr Buhari spoke of the \"paradox\" of Nigeria asking its neighbours for help, despite itself providing help to so many other countries in the past.\n\"How the mighty have fallen,\" he said.\nAfrica news highlights\nChibok abductions: What we know a year on\nThe president criticised the previous government's \"incompetence\" in dealing with the kidnapping and the broader Boko Haram insurgency.\nNigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Niger and Benin are all expected to provide troops for the 7,500-strong regional task force to tackle Boko Haram.\nThe force will be led by Nigeria but have its headquarters in the Chadian capital, N'Djamena.\nThis year, Chad, Cameroon and Niger have been helping Nigeria recapture territory from the insurgents.\nThe Chibok schoolgirls have not been seen since last May when Boko Haram released a video of around 130 of them gathered together reciting the Koran.\nSome of those who were kidnapped have been forced to join the militant group, the BBC was told last week.\nAmnesty International estimates that at least 2,000 women and girls have been abducted by Boko Haram since the start of 2014.", "Then you spot the magpie, its beak aiming for their heads with laser-like precision.\nHowever, this is not a scene from classic horror film The Birds, but the wedding of Phillip and Sara Maria in New South Wales, Australia, who just happened to annoy some very angry birds with their choice of picture location.\nPhotographer Karen Parr revealed how two magpies \"working as a team\" began swooping on the group as soon as they got out the car following the ceremony on 8 October.\nBut because they had driven for half an hour to reach this particularly picturesque spot, there was nothing the bridal party could do but carry on - despite the danger.\nWith a groomsman yelling warnings every time the magpies took aim, the shoot began.\n\"I think we probably got swooped about 20 times. It was quite scary at the time. We were cursing the birds,\" Ms Parr recalled.\nLuckily, the new Mr and Mrs Maria were quite calm about the situation.\n\"She was an amazing bride. They just rolled with it.\"\nBut the photographer, who has been taking wedding pictures for nine years, admitted she probably was not quite as relaxed.\n\"He went for me a few times. I probably screamed a little bit loud,\" she said.\nDespite the almost constant onslaught, Ms Parr only managed to capture the bird in perfect action on one occasion - and these pictures are the result.\n\"The groom in particular was quite chuffed with it - he made it his Facebook profile picture straight away,\" she said.\nAustralian magpies are known to attack people during August and September - a period of time nicknamed \"swooping season\" - while their chicks are in the nest.\nLast year, there were 801 attacks in New South Wales alone, according to Daily Mail Australia.", "In the recording, released via social media, the speaker says IS fighters will never stop fighting \"even if only one soldier remains\".\nCorrespondents say the recording appears authentic and recent.\nBBC analysts say the message is probably also intended to counter the claim that Baghdadi has been killed.\nThe IS leader was said to have been caught in a US-led air strike near the Iraqi city of Mosul last week.\nThursday's 17-minute recording makes no direct reference to that air strike, but does mention some developments that have occurred since then.\nAn English transcript of the recording was also released.\nMeanwhile, US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the US-led coalition fighting IS was making progress, but must \"prepare for a long and difficult struggle\".\nThe IS audiotape mentions US President Barack's Obama decision to deploy an extra 1,500 troops to Iraq - a move announced shortly after the air strike on Mosul.\nBBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says the tone of the recording is characteristically defiant and incendiary, and the cadences and language do sound like those of the Islamic State leader.\nThe recording calls on IS supporters to \"erupt volcanoes of jihad\" across the world.\nHe disparages opponents of IS as \"Jews, Crusaders, apostates... [and] devils\", and says the US and its allies \"are terrified, weak and powerless\".\nThe recording also calls for attacks in Saudi Arabia - describing Saudi leaders as \"the head of the snake\" - and says that the US-led military campaign in Syria and Iraq is failing.\nGulf state rulers, who have joined the US-led coalition against IS, are described as \"treacherous\".\nAll week rumours have swirled around the status of Islamic State's elusive leader. Within hours of new, unsubstantiated claims on Thursday that he had died, an audio message emerged purporting to be from him, promising an expansion of IS's campaign into new countries. It calls for attacks on the \"'Land of the Two Holy Mosques\", meaning Saudi Arabia, listing Shia Muslims as the top target.\nIt mentions new oaths of allegiance from jihadists in Egypt, Algeria and Libya and mocks the announcement of 1,500 additional US military advisers in Iraq, saying US-led air strikes had failed to stop the advance of Islamic State.\nIn fact the airstrikes have done exactly that in military terms, driving IS fighters off key dams, but there is no denying the spread of IS's popularity among violent extremists across the Middle East and even in Europe.\nWhat is Islamic State?\nProfile: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\nThe recording also refers to new pledges of allegiance from jihadist groups in Libya, Egypt and Yemen that occurred in recent days.\n\"O soldiers of the Islamic State... erupt volcanoes of jihad everywhere. Light the earth with fire against all dictators,\" the voice on the recording says.\nIn Washington on Thursday, US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel told Congress that there had been \"steady and sustainable progress\" against IS.\nIn contrast to the audio messaging disparaging the coalition efforts, Mr Hagel said US-led air strikes had helped in \"degrading and destroying Isil's [IS] war fighting capacity and in denying safe haven to its fighters\".\n\"Directly and through support of Iraqi forces, coalition air strikes have hit Isil's command and control, its leadership, its revenue sources... and impaired its ability to amass forces,\" he added.\nThe self-styled Islamic State - a jihadist group also known as Isis, or Isil - has seized swathes of Syria and Iraq since June, declaring a caliphate over territory it controls.\nIt emerged on Thursday that the group has reportedly announced plans to mint its own gold, silver and copper coins.\nA statement posted on jihadist sites, which could not be independently verified, said the coins were to be used in IS-controlled areas.\nThe statement said this would counter \"the tyrannical currency system that was imposed on the Muslims\" - thought to be a reference to the US dollar.\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi himself is a shadowy figure who only showed himself publicly for the first time in a video released in July, when he delivered a sermon in Mosul, Iraq.\nHe claims lineage from the family and tribe of the Prophet Muhammad.\nAlthough currently limited to Iraq and Syria, IS has promised to \"break the borders\" of Jordan and Lebanon and to \"free Palestine\".\nThe group has attracted support from extremists around the world and demands that all swear allegiance to its leader.\nIts brutal tactics - including mass killings and the beheadings of soldiers and journalists - have sparked fear and outrage across the world, including from Muslim groups.\nIn February, al-Qaeda disavowed IS for its actions in Syria.", "All dogs are now legally required to have been chipped by the time they are eight weeks old.\nThe charity said the improvement showed it was working but still meant 30,000 dogs would be untraceable if lost.\nIt added 8% of the 3,222 unclaimed strays in Wales' council kennels last year did not have up-to-date chips.\nIn 2015-16, before the law changed, 3,193 lost dogs were reunited with their owners in Wales - 15% of which were identified as a direct result of being chipped.\nBut its head of campaigns, Andrew Jackson, said the charity had noticed a \"growing number\" of breeders not microchipping puppies at eight weeks, or not registering their details.\nHe said this could cause problems for unsuspecting buyers who may not realise they should already have a chip registered to the breeder to ensure traceability.\nThe charity said 2,751 fines had been issued to UK dog owners for non-compliance since the law came in on 6 April 2016.\nMost - 1,464 - were for dogs without chips, while 1,287 were issued to owners who had failed to update their details.\nMr Jackson said: \"It is excellent to see that so many owners have taken action to get their dogs chipped - a painless process for dogs which many charities will carry out for free.\n\"However, still too many are not being reunited where owners have not updated their details when they move home or get a new phone number - heartbreaking for the owner and easily avoidable with a five-minute phone call.\n\"All dog owners have a responsibility to microchip their dog and it's very encouraging to see such a strong take-up - now owners must make sure this effort does not go to waste and check their dog's chip is up to date.\"\nIn February, a petition, backed by RSPCA Cymru, was launched calling for all councils to scan microchips of all pets found dead or alive.", "Patricia Smith and Charles Woods, parents of Sean Smith and Tyrone Woods, filed a lawsuit against Mrs Clinton for wrongful death and defamation.\nThe suit claims the former secretary of state's use of a private email server contributed to their sons' death.\nThe parents also accuse her of defaming them in statements to the media.\nIslamic militants attacked a US diplomatic compound in 2012 and killed four Americans, including ambassador Chris Stevens, while Mrs Clinton was secretary of state.\nThough a House Republicans committee cleared Mrs Clinton of any wrongdoing earlier this year, the issue has dogged her presidential campaign.\nThe suit was filed on behalf of the parents by the conservative group Freedom Watch.\nThe parents, who have both spoken out against Mrs Clinton, argue her \"'extreme carelessness' in handling confidential and classified information\" on her private server may have revealed the location of State Department employees in Libya.\nThose details, the suit argued, could have been obtained by \"hostile adversaries\" who may have hacked her server and ultimately led to their sons's deaths.\nFBI director James Comey announced last month that it was \"possible that hostile actors gained access\" to Mrs Clinton's email server, but added the agency did not find conclusive evidence that it was hacked.\nChris Stevens, the sister of ambassador Stevens, told The New Yorker earlier this year that she did not blame Mrs Clinton, saying it was \"inappropriate\" to make the Benghazi attacks as a political issue.\n\"The Benghazi Mission was understaffed. We know that now. But, again, Chris knew that,\" she said. \"It is not something they did to him. It is something he took on himself.\"\nHillary's Clinton's 'emailgate' diced and sliced'\nHackers for Hillary\nThe suit also claims Mrs Clinton made \"false and defamatory statements negligently, recklessly and purposefully and/or intentionally with malice\" in public statements.\nThe parents said Mrs Clinton blamed the attack on a controversial YouTube video mocking the Islamic prophet Muhammad, but later denied making those statements.\nNick Merrill, a Clinton campaign spokesman, said in response to the suit: \"While no one can imagine the pain of the families of the brave Americans we lost at Benghazi, there have been nine different investigations into this attack and none found any evidence whatsoever of any wrongdoing on the part of Hillary Clinton.\"", "He said the crisis was \"focusing attention\" on the challenges large-scale migration across the EU presents.\nEU migration is one of the issues the government wants to address in its renegotiation of Britain's membership.\nHis comments come ahead of an EU summit on the migrant crisis later, which David Cameron is due to attend.\nThe PM is expected to urge EU leaders to provide more support to vulnerable people in Syria and the wider region.\nEurope is struggling to deal with a vast influx of migrants and refugees reaching the continent - most fleeing conflict in Syria but large numbers also fleeing violence and poverty in Afghanistan, Eritrea and Kosovo.\nOn Tuesday, EU interior ministers agreed a mandatory plan to relocate 120,000 migrants across the continent, despite opposition from some European countries.\nThe UK has opted-out of the quota system but has agreed to take in 20,000 refugees from the camps bordering war-torn Syria over the next five years.\nSpeaking in Brussels, Mr Hammond said: \"This migration crisis has thrown into stark relief some of the issues the EU has to deal with - and that plays directly into some of the issues we are are raising in our renegotiation proposition.\"\nHe said some of the countries most hostile to challenging the principle of freedom of movement were now \"focusing attention\" on the problems of large-scale migration within Europe.\n\"The two things are separate but they are related,\" he told reporters, adding \"and that's been our argument all along\".\nHe said he did not know whether or not it would end up helping the UK's case as it seeks to reform Britain's membership of the EU ahead of an in/out referendum on UK membership.\nMr Hammond also played down talk of a quick renegotiation deal - ahead of a referendum that must happen by the end of 2017.\nThe government is ramping up diplomatic efforts to put the UK's EU reforms back on the agenda and persuade other EU countries to back it, following a summer dominated by the migration crisis.\nIn the latest stage of the government's campaign to convince other leaders of Britain's case, Mr Cameron met French President Francois Hollande at his country residence, Chequers, on Tuesday.\nMr Hammond is to hold meetings with officials in Brussels on Wednesday.", "Thierry Solere's resignation adds to a slew of notable departures, including the campaign treasurer on Thursday.\nThe conservative candidate has slipped down the opinion polls amid an inquiry into political payments to his wife.\nHis woes have raised speculation that ex-PM Alain Juppe could return to the race if Mr Fillon were to pull out.\nMr Juppe was overwhelmingly defeated by Mr Fillon in the Republicans' primary in November, securing only 33% of the vote to Mr Fillon's 66%.\nSources close to Mr Juppe said he would be prepared to step in, but only with the unanimous support of the party and only if Mr Fillon were to go voluntarily.\nA new opinion poll suggests Mr Fillon would be eliminated in the first round of presidential election voting on 23 April, and that far-right candidate Marine Le Pen would challenge independent centrist Emmanuel Macron in the two-candidate run-off on 7 May. Mr Macron would win that contest, a number of opinion polls have suggested.\nMr Fillon has so far said he has no intention of stepping down despite the continuing haemorrhage of allies.\nMore than 60 politicians have said they can no longer support him.\nThe latest, Mr Solere, said on Twitter: \"I've decided to end my duties as Francois Fillon's spokesman.\"\nHe joins campaign treasurer Gilles Boyer, two deputy directors and Mr Fillon's foreign affairs spokesman, among others.\nMr Fillon's Paris home was raided by investigators on Thursday as part of the inquiry into the payments to his Welsh-born wife, Penelope.\nThe Le Canard Enchaine newspaper alleges she was paid \u00e2\u201a\u00ac831,400 (\u00c2\u00a3710,000; $900,000) over several years for working as a parliamentary assistant for Mr Fillon and his successor, but had no parliamentary pass - raising questions over whether she did the work she was paid for.\nMr Fillon, 62, denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a \"political assassination\".\nHe is planning a major rally near the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Sunday.\nMr Juppe, 71, has kept a low profile as the mayor of Bordeaux since his defeat in the primary.\nQuoting a close source, Le Parisien said Mr Juppe would \"remain loyal\" but \"not inactive\" in a situation resembling a \"collective suicide\". Mr Juppe indicated that the call for him to return would have to come not just from his own supporters but from a far wider field.\nRepublican lawmaker Georges Fenech was among those appealing for Mr Juppe to return, telling BFM TV: \"I don't think we have a single minute to lose in showing we have the ability to react to what has happened. I think Alain Juppe offers an alternative.\"\nThe deadline for candidates to declare they are running is 17 March, two days after Mr Fillon is scheduled to appear before a judge overseeing the investigation.", "The team surveyed more than 26 million galaxies in the largest study of its kind.\nThe map will help scientists understand what dark matter is made from and learn more about another mysterious phenomenon called dark energy.\nThe results have been released by the international Dark Energy Consortium (DES).\nAccording to Professor Ofer Lahav of University College London (UCL), and chair of the DES Advisory Board, the map would provide new insights into how the Universe operates.\n\"Dark energy and dark matter represent probably one of the biggest mysteries in the world of science. And this has generated a lot of interest across the whole of science because it is a major shakeup. And actually we still don't know what it is,\" he said.\nScientists have suspected that there is more material in the Universe than we can observe for more than 80 years.\nThe movement of stars and galaxies indicate that the Universe is also made up of invisible particles called dark matter.\nIn 1998, two teams of astronomers discovered the expansion of the Universe was accelerating, rather than slowing down, as the theory at the time suggested. Physicists speculated that the acceleration was caused by something they named dark energy.\nSince then, observations have indicated that dark energy and dark matter together account for 96% of the Universe. The challenge has been to find ways of studying these invisible phenomena in detail.\n\"We cannot just say we don't know what it is, we have to make an effort to see what it is,\" according to Prof Lahav.\nThe Dark Energy Survey is the most ambitious effort to date. It began in 2004 and involves 400 scientists from 26 institutions in seven countries.\nThe survey involves taking pictures of 26 million galaxies across a large expanse of the sky using the Blanco telescope in Chile. To do this, the research team had to build one of the most sensitive cameras ever built. The 570-megapixel camera is capable of detecting light from galaxies that are eight billion light-years away.\nBy studying the way in which the light was distorted by the intervening dark matter, researchers were able to calculate its distribution. And by studying the way in which the distribution changes over time they can calculate the way in which dark energy acts on it.\nThe team was also able to infer the amounts of dark energy and dark matter from the density and locations of galaxies.\nThe results show support for previous studies that indicate the Universe is made up of 4% ordinary matter, 26% dark matter and 70% dark energy.\nThe hope is that a detailed study of the map will give clues about what dark matter and dark energy might be and so lead to a more complete theory of physics.\nThe data released today draws from just one year of observations. The researchers plan to collect data for four more years over an even larger area of the sky. Prof Lahav says that there is much more to come.\nHe explained: \"Once we have the full survey, 300 million galaxies and a thousand supernovae, we may be providing input for a new Einstein to tell us what does it all mean - why is the Universe made the way it is?\"\nFollow Pallab on Twitter", "The two bodies were discovered at a property in Rosefield Street in the city's west end.\nA Police Scotland spokeswoman said the deaths were being treated as unexplained.\nThe property has been sealed off by police while officers investigate.", "Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said that the community and the police had a \"fractured\" relationship.\nA 25-year-old black man, Freddie Gray, suffered fatal injuries when arrested, sparking protests and riots.\nThe US Department of Justice is already investigating whether Mr Gray's civil rights were violated in the incident.\nMs Rawlings-Blake said the US attorney general understands the urgency of her request for an investigation.\nThe request comes a day after the new head of the justice department, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, visited the city.\nA spokeswoman for the US Department of Justice - who would handle the request - acknowledged receipt of the request for a \"pattern or practice\" investigation.\n\"The attorney general is actively considering that option in light of what she heard from law enforcement, city officials, and community, faith and youth leaders in Baltimore yesterday,\" Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said.\nBaltimore City Council President Jack Young has been calling for this kind of investigation since October - well before Mr Gray's arrest and death in April - said his spokesman.\nThe new investigation that is being called for is similar to the one that was done in Ferguson following the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, by a white police officer last summer.\nThe wide-ranging investigations look for patterns of discrimination within the police departments being reviewed. They can involve the examination of how officers search and arrest suspects, and how they use force against them.\nThe investigation's results can sometimes include an agreement known as a consent decree, in which the police department in question agrees to make specific changes, while an outside monitor is appointed to ensure compliance.\nThe US Justice Department seems to be stepping up its reviews of police departments around the country.\nIn the first five years of the Obama administration, the US Justice Department began investigations into more than 20 police departments around the country - that's more than double the amount in the five-year period before that.\nThe vast majority of police agencies that are reviewed and found to be in violation of the US constitution voluntarily agree to implement reforms, the Justice Department says. However, when they do not agree, the department can file lawsuits to force an overhaul.\nInvestigations do not always find abuse. Investigators in the most recent five-year period have reviewed five law enforcement agencies without finding constitutional violations.\nFor more: Four other US police forces under scrutiny\nThe US Justice Department formed this kind of agreement with the New Orleans Police Department in 2012, and the police force there was required to make widespread reforms.\nIn April, US Justice Department issued a report detailing widespread abuse at the police department in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and called for an overhaul of its internal affairs unit.", "UK Coal announced plans in April to close Kellingley Colliery in North Yorkshire with the loss of 700 jobs.\nThe government said it would loan the firm \u00c2\u00a310m for an 18-month \"managed closure\" of Kellingley and Thoresby Colliery in Nottinghamshire.\nNow the NUM has revealed its five-year plan to save the pit is on hold.\nChris Kitchen, from the union, said a buyout would involve employees taking on the whole of the company's \u00c2\u00a345m debts.\nHe said: \"As it stands, the employee buyout has been shelved, not totally ditched. The main problem is the costs have spiralled out of control.\n\"The lads at the pit were thinking of taking on Kellingley's debts, which was doable. But when you're talking about them shouldering the whole of the company, it wasn't realistic.\"\nUK Coal has strongly denied that it is 'blocking' an employee buyout of the pit.\nAndrew Mackintosh, from the firm, said union officials had \"buried their heads in the sand\" and ignored the company's advice about the true cost of coal and securing funding.\nHe said: \"UK Coal is bitterly disappointed with the false accusations and inaccuracies announced by trade union branch officials today.\n\"The company has spent a huge amount of time explaining what would be needed to make the employee buy out scheme viable.\n\"At a meeting this week it was found that the steering committee had failed to pursue any of the recommendations made weeks earlier.\n\"The proposed plan was totally unviable and concerns were raised by directors that the buy out deal was not accurately presented to Kellingley employees as it did not include millions of pounds of liabilities that would have to be paid.\n\"To accuse the company of blocking this buy out proposal is both dishonest and naive.\"\nUnions announced in May they were considering an employee buyout of the pit, which is on the border between North and West Yorkshire.\nThe plan would have seen workers invest \u00c2\u00a32,000 each and take a ten per cent pay cut to keep the pit open until 2020.\nUK Coal said it would close the pit near Knottingley by the end of 2015 in a bid to avoid insolvency.\nIt blamed its financial problems on the global market with falling coal prices, on top of a fire which destroyed and subsequently closed its Daw Mill Colliery in Warwickshire.\nIf Kellingley and Thoresby close it will see the total loss of 1,300 jobs and will leave employee-owned Hatfield colliery in South Yorkshire as Britain's last remaining deep mine.\nYvette Cooper, MP for nearby Pontefract, said: \"The workforce have come up with a good plan to keep Kellingley open beyond 2015.\n\"The government and UK Coal management need to work urgently with the workforce to make this work, instead of just focusing on the closure plan.\"", "Etienne Capoue had put the Hornets ahead on 56 minutes as the hosts looked in control of the game.\nBut substitute Michy Batshuayi equalised with his first goal for Chelsea since his \u00a333m move.\nThen Costa ran on to substitute Cesc Fabregas' pass and slid the ball under Heurelho Gomes with three minutes left.\nThe win gives Chelsea boss Antonio Conte a 100% start in the Premier League after Monday's victory against West Ham.\nChelsea seemed to be running out of ideas before Conte made his first change on 71 minutes, with the visitors registering just one shot on target.\nBut within seven minutes the Italian had rolled the dice and brought on Victor Moses, Batshuayi and Fabregas.\nBatshuayi opened his Premier League account just seven minutes after coming on, reacting fastest when Heurelho Gomes spilled Eden Hazard's shot to score.\nFabregas, an unused substitute against West Ham, then found Costa with a perfectly-weighted pass through the Watford defence - and the Spain striker did the rest.\nConte and Walter Mazzarri met seven times in Serie A as managers, with the new Watford boss only coming out on top once - and that was in 2010.\nThe build-up was dominated by the rivalry between the two Italians and Conte admitted the pair fell out during their time coaching Napoli and Juventus respectively.\nAnd Mazzarri seemed to have his tactics spot on for 80 minutes of the match. His side pressed well and nullified the attacking trio of Pedro, Oscar and Hazard.

Donald Trump wants to renegotiate it or pull America out of it.\nBecause the US has the world's largest economy, and is the second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after China, the outcome of this struggle will reverberate internationally. If the US leaves the Paris Agreement, the painfully-negotiated deal could unravel.\nWith such sharply opposing perspectives, this is the first presidential contest in which the candidates are highlighting their stances on global warming and energy, and using them to attack each other.\nSo how is this playing out in a swing state like Ohio, which hosts some of America's oldest coalfields and one of the most innovative solar panel makers?\nThrough the east of the state, the mighty Ohio River flows like an artery for the coal industry, with the heavy machinery of mines, loading stations and power plants lining the steep green banks.\nFor more than a century, this has been a crucible of power production for the US economy, with vast quantities of coal burned to generate electricity. And because the jobs paid well, and there were lots of them, the communities thrived.\nBut in recent years, fortunes have changed. The pollution belching from the smokestacks has been gradually limited by wave after wave of legislation - first on emissions of sulphur dioxide, then of nitrogen dioxide, and now of carbon dioxide.\nIt's no surprise, but along this valley the Environmental Protection Agency is held in contempt. This is the body responsible for cleaning up the air and reducing greenhouse gases under President Obama's Clean Power Plan. A key Trump promise is to dismantle both the agency and the plan.\nThe reality is that environmental regulation is not the only challenge to coal. Another has come from fracking, the revolution that's opened up deep layers of shale rock to release new supplies of plentiful gas that's cheaper and cleaner than coal.\nIn any event, the result is that demand for coal is falling and the mines have long been in trouble. As many as 50 mining companies have filed for bankruptcy.\nAt one pit head, a dozen blackened faces emerged from a lift - this was the day shift, about half the size it would normally have been. Cuts are taking their toll. The mine will close by the end of the year.\nHere, Hillary Clinton is a hate figure. A newspaper cutting, pinned to a wall, highlights her saying \"We're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"\nShe later clarified that comment. What she meant to say was that the switch to cleaner energy would inevitably mean coal closures and that she wants to support communities making the transition. But the damage was done.\nI talked to the mine's owner, one of the leading figures in the coal industry, Robert Murray of the Murray Energy Corporation.\nAn outspoken defender of US coal, and prominent in launching legal challenges against the Clean Power Plan, he followed his father into the mines and keeps a polished lump of coal in his board-room.\nWhile many coal mining companies declined our requests for interviews, Mr Murray jumped at the chance, and there was no holding him back.\n\"What happens is when two coal miners get laid off, if they own anything it's their homes and, when they get laid off, they have no one to sell their homes to.\n\"So those people who just want to work in honour and dignity are denied that, and it's not the America that I cherish\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 That's why I speak out like I do, that's why I say, Obama is a greater scourge than America has ever had in its history.\"\nDonald Trump would agree with all that. He sees coal as abundant and homegrown, and responsible for thousands of jobs. And he talks of revitalising the industry, which goes down very well in mining country.\nThe fact that it is the dirtiest fossil fuel is irrelevant in the Trump view because global warming is a \"hoax\" as he once called it, though he later said that was a joke.\nSo what about the alternative vision?\nOnly a hundred miles to the west, there's a very different Ohio. The zoo in the city of Toledo has solar panels covering its walkways. The huge roof of the city's famous Museum of Art is shining with them too.\nWith many major companies like Wal-Mart investing in renewable power, the sight of solar installations in this notoriously gas-guzzling nation is no longer so unusual.\nOn the edge of Toledo, in a landscaped business park, stand the sleek buildings of First Solar. A gigantic manufacturing hall is busy with robots and people working side-by-side. Together with a larger sister plant in southeast Asia, this company can boast of a remarkable statistic: it churns out a new solar panel every single second.\nThe executives do not want to be drawn into talking politics but they argue that we are witnessing a fundamental transformation: not only have solar panels increased in efficiency but they have also tumbled in price.\nNo longer is solar just a fad for the eco-conscious rich. The largest solar installations - \"utility-scale\" in the jargon - in the sunniest parts of the US can generate electricity that is comparable in cost to that of coal.\nThough solar power is still intermittent, as with wind, the fall in cost does mean that during the hot days of high summer, when air-conditioning is running at full blast, the electricity supply can be carbon-free.\nThe implication is that solar power may be starting to make sense purely on financial grounds, regardless of any other motivation such as aiming to reduce carbon emissions.\nAt the state's largest solar array, covering a long rolling field, Bill Spratley of Green Energy Ohio, a renewables advocacy group, told me that the new reality of cheaper renewable energy would change the debate.\n\"We have some politicians that are fighting the last war, they're fighting over something, they still believe solar is in the future but it's here now.\n\"We've probably passed the tipping point or the turning point and they just don't know it yet.\"\nIf solar costs keep falling, and coal continues to be undermined by shale gas, then it may be that a Trump victory would not do much to alter what could be an historic trend away from coal into cleaner sources of energy. Even outside the Paris Agreement, US energy companies and big corporations may still see logic in making the switch.\nAs we leave the solar farm, an engineer managing the installation joined the conversation. \"Solar makes sense to me,\" he said, \"and I'm a Republican\".", "Two rockets hit a district controlled by the Hezbollah organisation, officials and residents were quoted as saying by news agencies.\nTension has been high over the conflict in neighbouring Syria.\nOn Saturday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah promised his supporters they would prevail in Syria, where they are backing President Bashar al-Assad.\nSyria on Sunday said it had agreed \"in principle\" to take part in next month's talks in Geneva aimed at negotiating an end to more than two years of violence in the country.\nThere was no immediate indication who had fired the rockets in Beirut but Lebanese Interior Minister Marwan Charbel said the projectiles, believed to be 107mm rockets with an 8-km (5-mile) range, had been fired from a position to the south-east.\nBy Jim MuirBBC News, Beirut\nThe firing of two rockets into Hezbollah's home turf in Beirut's southern suburbs aggravated fears of a wider flare-up between Lebanese factions which are already fighting one another across the border on different sides of the Syrian war.\nBut in his speech just hours before, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah made it clear he did not want to see Lebanon itself burst into flames. While he pledged to continue fighting alongside the Syrian regime until the Sunni-based revolt was quelled, there is no sense that Hezbollah is spoiling for a fight in Lebanon.\nBut the fact is that its Shia fighters are combating and killing the mainly Sunni rebels from the majority Syrian community, on behalf of a regime dominated by President Assad's Alawite minority.\nThat is an explosive mixture, and even though there is little appetite in Lebanon for a wholesale resumption of sectarian civil war, the least that can be expected is more random attacks like that on south Beirut.\nOne security official told Associated Press that rocket launchers had been found in woods in a predominantly Christian and Druse area, although this has not been independently confirmed.\nDozens of militants from Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim organisation, are said to have been killed in recent fighting alongside Syrian troops, who face a mainly Sunni Muslim opposition.\nThe fiery speech by the Hezbollah leader had raised fears that the involvement of his fighters in Syria would have repercussions in Lebanon, the BBC's Jim Muir reports from Beirut.\nThe leader of Lebanon's mainly Sunni March 14th movement, former Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, said that what Hezbollah was doing in Syria was \"political and military suicide\", our correspondent notes.\nThe missiles were Grad rockets, a Soviet-made weapon, an unnamed Lebanese security source told AFP news agency.

who put forward the successful amendment - said the cut in support to disability benefit claimants was \"drastic\" - and the concessions were \"just not enough\".\nHe said the government had not been able to provide evidence for its argument that the cuts \"incentivised\" people back to work and insisted  his \"moderate\" amendment would give ministers time to justify the policy.\nThe decision by peers to inflict defeat on the government sets up another showdown between the Commons and the Lords, coming not long after last year's clash over tax credits, which led to moves by ministers to limit the powers of the Lords.", "Carling advertises the lager as 4% alcohol by volume (ABV) but it has been brewed at 3.7% since 2012, its US owners Molson Coors have said.\nABV was reduced in order to cut tax on Carling products, the firm said during a hearing brought by HMRC.\nMolson Coors said beer was allowed to have a natural variation of 0.5%, and said customers had not been misled.\nThere is no suggestion Molson Coors has broken any laws.\nBeer brewed in the UK is subject to excise duty decided by its alcoholic strength - meaning stronger products pay higher rates of tax.\nAccording to documents from the tax tribunal - held in February and March this year - HMRC argued Carling had underpaid tax by more than \u00c2\u00a350m between 1 September 2012 and 31 January 2015.\nIt claimed the owners of Carling should have paid tax according to the 4% alcohol strength stated on cans, bottles and other products.\nHowever, the firm successfully argued the actual strength of the lager meant it was right to pay less tax.\nGiving evidence to the tribunal, Philip Rutherford, vice president of tax for Molson Coors Europe, argued Carling it should pay tax on \"the actual ABV of the beer\" rather than the one stated on the label.\nAccording to the papers, Mr Rutherford told the tribunal the \"key driver\" behind the decision not to change the labelling on Carling products was to stop retailers - including supermarkets and pub chains - demanding \"a slice\" of the savings.\nThe tribunal found in favour of Molson Coors.\nAccording to EU laws relating to the labelling of alcohol, products are allowed an ABV tolerance of +0.5% or -0.5% on products between 1.2% and 5.5% ABV.\nMolson Coors said Carling customers have not been misled.\n\"As a major brand, the trust of our consumers is paramount. We abide by all legal requirements in the brewing and labelling of Carling,\" it said in a statement.\n\"The natural process of brewing means all batches of Carling vary fractionally in alcohol content - the variation range for Carling is less than a quarter of 1% (0.23%).\n\"It is completely normal for consumable products to have a slight variation. For example, the allowed variation for wine is 1%.\"", "An icebreaker carved a channel through the ice for the Northern Fleet flotilla, Interfax news agency said.\nBesides Sredniy, five island bases are being built by 1,500 workers - at Alexandra Land, Rogachevo, Cape Schmidt, Wrangel and Kotelny.\nRussia sees the Arctic as a strategic priority in its new naval doctrine.\nThe fleet's vice-admiral, Viktor Sokolov, inspected the construction site on Sredniy, flying there by military helicopter when the flotilla reached the Kara Sea.

They then took the horn - a kilo of which could fetch as much as $60,000 (\u00c2\u00a349,300).\nBut the poachers appear to have been disturbed as his second - partially sawn - horn was left behind.\nThe zoo's two other white rhinos, 37-year-old Gracie and five-year-old Bruno, \"escaped the massacre\", the Thoiry Zoo revealed.\nBruno and Vince arrived at the zoo together in 2015. Vince, who was born in a zoo in the Netherlands, was one of 250 rhinos in European zoos who were part of a breeding programme.\nThe white rhino is a conservation success, having been brought from the edge of extinction in the late 19th Century to a population of about 20,000 animals.\nHowever, poaching has risen over the past few years, as demand from markets like Vietnam - where rhino horn is thought to have aphrodisiac properties - increases.\nFrance outlawed the trade in ivory and horns last year.", "That's what geochemists argue in Nature this week, on the basis of invisibly small traces of biomolecules dug up from beneath the Australian desert.\nThe molecules mark an explosion in the quantity of algae in the oceans.\nThis in turn fuelled a change in the food web that allowed the first microscopic animals to evolve, the authors suggest.\n\"This is one the most profound ecological and evolutionary transitions in Earth's history,\" lead researcher Jochen Brocks told the BBC's Science in Action programme.\nThe events took place a hundred million years before the so-called Cambrian Explosion, an eruption of complex life recorded in fossils around the world that puzzled Darwin and always hinted at some kind of biological prehistory.\nScattered traces of those precursor multi-celled organisms have since been recognised, but the evolutionary driver that led to their rise has been much argued over.\nCambridge University palaeontologist Nick Butterfield has said the period \"was arguably the most revolutionary in Earth history\", and not just because of the rapid biological changes. There were violent swings in climate, too, that experts have long suspected are intertwined.\nThe context was a planet that previously had long had life-sustaining oceans and a benign climate. Yet, for over three billion years - since 3.8 billion years before present according to most estimates - all life was single-celled, mostly bacteria; little evolutionary innovation had happened.\nAlgae, more complex than bacteria but still single-celled, had themselves had been around for over a billion years (the \"boring billion\" some palaeontologists call it), but without making much of an ecological impact.\nWith their DNA packed away safely inside a nucleus (so-called eukaryotes, like all animals and plants today), they had an evolutionary advantage over bacteria they seemed unable to exploit.\nThat changed about 650 million years ago, according to the new study.\nThere are no fossils of the algae. Instead, Brocks and his team at the Australian National University, have tracked down molecular remnants of their cell walls, molecules closely related to the cholesterol in our bodies, \"the most stable thing of any organism - fat,\" Brocks quips.\nAfter every other trace of the cells had decayed, these fat molecules remained and were absorbed into sediments, and over geological time became cemented into the bedrock of Australia. To be drilled up and analysed hundreds of millions of years later.\n\"The signals that we find show that the algal population went up by a factor of a hundred to a thousand and the diversity went right up in one big bang, and never went back again,\" Brocks says.\nThis ecological flip happened just after one of the greatest environmental catastrophes the planet has ever seen - the \"Snowball Earth\" period when ice extended from pole to pole, and even at the equator temperatures could have plunged to minus 60 degrees.\nThe episode ended after 50 million years, when the build-up of volcanic CO2 in the atmosphere created a supergreenhouse that melted the ice in a second cataclysm.\nThe connection, Brocks believes, is that glacial action ground up continental rocks, releasing the nutrient phosphate which was then washed into the oceans as the thaw progressed.\nToday's agricultural green revolution is dependent on phosphates dug up in giant mines around the world, and the pre-Cambrian biological revolution may have been powered the same way, the researchers believe.\n\"This rise in algae happens just around the time the first animals appeared on the scene,\" Brocks explains. \"It was algae at the bottom of the food web that created this burst of energy and nutrients that allowed larger and more complex creatures to evolve.\"\nYale University's Noah Planavsky, whose study earlier this year [Nature link] revealed the phosphate nutrient outburst following the Snowball Earth, says the new revelations are \"incredibly important\".\n\"It gives the first evidence of ecosystems dominated by complex lifeforms - the eukaryotes,\" he told the BBC.\nIn a commentary also in Nature, Andrew Knoll of Harvard University, a world authority on pre-Cambrian life, says the new work makes \"a substantial contribution\" to revealing \"the relationship between life and the surrounding physical environment\" at a critical time in animal evolution.\n\"Food source changes might have helped to pave the way for the animal radiation,\" he agrees, though adding \"key questions remain\".\nGetting the data was painstaking work, says MIT's Roger Summons, who has previously collaborated with Brocks. The nanogram traces of pre-Cambrian oil measured in the study had to be picked out from a fog of contamination made by fossil fuels.\n\"I applaud Jochen's insight and his tenacity,\" Summons wrote in an e-mail. \"The results show how fastidious attention to detail ultimately pays off.\"\nHowever, he suggests the tale is not complete. Likewise, Cambridge University's Nick Butterfield, while accepting the data, disagrees with the interpretation.\nIn fact, he thinks that Brocks has got cause and effect back to front; the explosion of algae did not drive the rise of animals, he says.\n\"There's no evidence for animal evolution being constrained by a shortage of food,\" he argued in an e-mail.\nInstead, he says, it was the rise of animals - sponges to be precise - that cleared the ecological path for algae.\nBrocks and Butterfield debated the interpretation in the corridors of the Goldschmidt geochemistry conference in Paris this week, as others looked on.\nBrocks remains unswayed - that the outburst of algae 650 million years ago \"kicked off an escalating arms race\" in which larger creatures, fuelled by their ocean-grazing, become prey to yet larger ones - until you end up with the complexity we see today.", "A spokeswoman for the Schlitterbahn Water Park in Kansas City said it was saddened by the death and the park had been closed pending an investigation.\nThe incident happened on Sunday on the Verrueckt ride, which drops users almost 169 feet (52 metres) at 65mph (105kph) in a three-person raft.\nNo details were immediately given about the circumstances of the incident.\nHowever, Kansas police have said it is being treated as an accident.\n\"We honestly don't know what's happened,\" Schlitterbahn spokeswoman Winter Prosapio said. \"That's why a full investigation is necessary.

Arab and Western diplomats say the imminent threat of an assault by Syrian government forces and their Palestinian allies has also gone.\n\"For the moment, fighting is mainly by local Palestinians,\" said one Western diplomat. \"But if IS stays in an area so close to Damascus, it's hard to say what will happen.\"\nAnd, for the moment, Yarmouk's descent into what UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon called \"the deepest circle of hell\" appears to have precipitated new measures of co-operation from the Syrian government and some opposition groups in a longstanding humanitarian battle to aid this stricken community.\n\"Our priority now is to save lives,\" said the UN's Deputy Envoy Ramzy Ezzedine Ramzy, who spoke to me by telephone from Damascus.\n\"Conditions inside are extremely dire,\" he said. \"We are devising plans to help those who leave, but also those who stay.\"\nThousands have now been allowed to escape from Yarmouk where they've been trapped for nearly two years by a punishing government siege, and threats from rival factions.\nMany residents are taking temporary shelter in adjoining neighbourhoods like Yalda and Babila where there are local agreements between armed opposition groups and the Syrian government.\n\"It's a good sign,\" said Mr Ramzy cautiously. \"We will continue to count on the government's co-operation.\"\nThe UN has been able to deliver more aid across opposition lines in this area than ever before. It has also secured assurances, some even in writing, from local rebel groups to allow relief convoys to reach the shelters through checkpoints under their control.\nEven the group now described as the most powerful opposition force in Yarmouk, the al-Qaeda-linked Jabhat al-Nusra, is reported to have promised safe passage to relief convoys entering Yarmouk.\nThat presents what one UN official called a \"highly charged\" political challenge, since it is under UN Security Council sanctions. There is also evidence that while IS and al-Nusra are battling each other elsewhere in Syria, in southern Damascus they are working together.\n\"Who is al-Nusra and who is IS just isn't clear,\" said an aid official in Damascus.\nMost fighters are from this area and often shift allegiances, depending on the state of rivalries and resources. That helps explain the sudden rise of IS in southern Damascus.\nIS's entry into Yarmouk on 1 April, with little or no fighting, was through a crossing controlled by al-Nusra. While al-Nusra insists it remains neutral, most clashes have pitted IS against al-Nusra's main rival, Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis - said to be linked to the Palestinian group Hamas.\n\"Yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begins to take hold,\" said Pierre Krahenbuhl who heads UNRWA, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency. Mr Krahenbuhl rushed to Damascus when the current crisis erupted and called for greater humanitarian access to the camp.\nUNRWA, along with local aid groups, has been struggling for years to provide sustained deliveries of food, water, and medical supplies. They have currently not been able to enter Yarmouk since 28 March.\nMr Ramzy said some supplies are now trickling in as residents manage to go back and forth through crossings with medical kits, chemicals for water purification, and food.\nBut it is not enough for a place which has become a symbol of the profound pain and tangled politics of Syria's war. On a few visits last year, where we managed to obtain rare access inside Yarmouk, we found streets of overwhelming destruction and despair.\nEstimates of how many people are still left in the camp after this latest upsurge in violence vary from 6,000 to 15,000, from a population of 18,000 when IS fighters moved in.\nMany remain trapped in their homes, fearing reprisals if they leave.\n\"Many people can't leave unless a safe passage is created with international observers,\" said Salim Salameh, who lived in Yarmouk until 2012 and now heads the Palestinian League for Human Rights, a Syrian advocacy group.\nAnd there are the even bigger questions over what the future holds for a once vibrant community which numbered about 180,000 before it was drawn into Syria's deadly conflict.\n\"We fear attention to this new military situation will prevail over the main issues of starvation, siege, and the attempt to find a durable solution for Palestinians in Syria and in particular Yarmouk,\" said Mr Salamah.\nEven as the hardship and horror of this war pushes thousands to flee, the powerful pull of Yarmouk remains. For families who first sought refuge there in the wake of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, fear of another displacement is seared in their sense of self.\n\"It's our little Palestine,\" insisted one man who had taken temporary refuge outside the camp. \"We must go back.\"\n\"This is a UN registered and UN protected population,\" a Western diplomat told me. \"The records exist and once this horrendous conflict is over there is the possibility to reconstruct a lost community.\"\nIt is, he said, a \"distant hope\".\nFor now though, for the people of Yarmouk, there is the more urgent hope to simply survive.", "The reaction in the immediate wake of the terrorism attacks in Brussels have shown the differences in Republicans and Democrats in tone and substance. It has also laid bare the divide between the isolationist tendencies of the Republican insurgent candidates and decades of GOP orthodoxy on international affairs.\nRepublicans appealed to fear and retrenchment, with Texas Senator Ted Cruz saying \"we need to empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighbourhoods before they become radicalised\" and called for sealing the border against \"terrorist infiltration\".\nDonald Trump doubled down on his call to ban Muslims from entering the country and \"close up our borders until we figure what is going on\", adding that \"we have to be very, very vigilant as to who we allow into this country\".\nIn an interview with the Washington Post editorial board the day before the Brussels attack, he questioned the utility of the Nato alliance and said, \"I know the outer world exists and I'll be very cognisant of that. But at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially the inner cities.\"\nAside from tweets and headline-grabbing sound bites, the Republican candidates offered little of substance, even though this was the week when both Mr Cruz and Mr Trump unveiled their foreign policy teams.\nBoth Democratic candidates adopted a sober tone, speaking of alliances with European countries, stepping up efforts to share intelligence, working with Arab allies and embracing American Muslims.\nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders may not agree on matters of foreign policy but they both upbraided Mr Cruz for his patrol proposal. President Barack Obama chimed in too, as he ended his historic visit to Cuba.\n\"As far as the notion of having surveillance of neighbourhoods where Muslims are present, I just left a country that engages in that kind of neighbourhood surveillance, which, by the way, the father of Senator Cruz escaped for America, the land of the free,\" said Mr Obama.\nMr Sanders said \"there is a lot of work to be done to protect our country, as well as to protect our allies in Europe and elsewhere, by the way\". But pressed on details, including on the alliance with Arab countries to counter the so-called Islamic State (IS), he remained vague and said none of it would be easy.\nAs a former secretary of state, Mrs Clinton gave the most comprehensive reaction at Stanford University, during a speech scheduled in reaction to the Brussels attacks.\nShe devoted a large chunks of her address to criticising the Republican candidates saying that: \"If Mr Trump gets his way, it will be like Christmas in the Kremlin\" and dismissed Mr Cruz's proposals as that of someone was \"in over [his] head\".\nMrs Clinton spoke in detail about the importance of the Nato alliance, the need for an ''intelligence surge\" but she gave few new policy prescriptions.\nShe was careful not to distance herself from the president who remains very popular with Democrats. She did repeat her call for a safe zone in Syria - the only public point of disagreement with President Obama - and was the only candidate to link an end to the conflict in Syria to the broader approach to dealing with the threat in Europe.\nMr Trump immediately tweeted: \"Just watched Hillary deliver a pre-packaged speech on terror. She's been in office fighting terror for 20 years \u00e2\u20ac\u201d and look where we are!\"\nThe bluster was quickly dismissed by Clinton advisors.\n\"The last few days have been a test. The race is not be an entertainer-in-chief but to be commander-in-chief,\" said Nicholas Burns, Harvard professor and former state department official who currently advises Mrs Clinton. He said Mr Trump had lost his bearings when he questioned the role of Nato barely a day before the Brussels attack.\n\"You can't succeed in this fight unless you're doing it with 20, 30 countries. Does Trump want to do this alone?\"\nIn a highly divisive election year, full of mud-slinging and name-calling, Democrats and members of the Republican establishment agree on one thing - they are aghast at the isolationism on display by Mr Trump and Mr Cruz. And it is the intra-GOP debate on foreign policy that is the most interesting to observe as it unfolds.\nIn an open letter earlier this month, 121 members of the GOP foreign policy establishment denounced Mr Trump's vision of \"American influence and power in the world [as] wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle. He swings from isolationism to military adventurism within the space of one sentence.\"\nMr Cruz didn't fare much better. His list of foreign policy advisors include a notorious Islamophobe, Frank Gaffney, and Walid Phares, a right-wing Christian Lebanese with ties to one of Lebanon's brutal wartime militias.\nSo the question now is how does the aftermath of the Brussels attack actually affect the campaign? Needless to say, each side believes it plays to their strengths as each claim they have the better answer to the security concerns and the long-term policy challenges.\nMr Burns said that the former secretary of state had responded \"calmly and decisively\", showcasing her leadership and experience. Mrs. Clinton is often described as a hawk, which is why some of the signatories of the open letter against Mr Trump have indicated they would be open to voting for Mrs Clinton as president if Trump is the Republican nominee.\nBut the co-ordinator of the letter, Elliot Abrams, a former deputy national security advisor to President George W Bush, now at the Council on Foreign Relations and an advisor to Mr Cruz, said the current mood in the country still \"helps the Republican nominee, whether Trump or Cruz. Republicans still have an advantage on security issues and they appear tougher.\"\nMr Cruz and Mr Trump's approval ratings went up a few points after the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, although Mrs Clinton still leads by a wide margin when Americans are asked who they trust most on terrorism or in an international crisis.\nThis is where the isolationism of Mr Cruz and Mr Trump can end up being a disadvantage - the more complicated the crisis becomes, from Europe to Libya and Egypt, the less they will be able to argue that the only answer is to pull up the drawbridges.", "Adam Howells, Dean Thomas and Paul Sulley were among nine men arrested after repeated disruption saw flares thrown during Coventry's 3-0 defeat to Northampton Town on Saturday.\nSky Blues fans are unhappy at the way their club is run by owners Sisu.\nCoventry City said the \"repeated disruptions\" were \"unacceptable\".\nSee more stories from across Coventry and Warwickshire here\nNorthamptonshire Police said six arrests were made when spectators from the away stand invaded the pitch and a further three when smoke bombs were let-off.\nAll nine individuals were bailed.\nMr Howells, 38, Mr Thomas and Mr Sulley were given interim three-month banning orders, but said the only way to \"hit Sisu where it hurts is to keep disrupting games\".\nA statement on behalf of the three men apologised to families.\nIt said: \"We are not thugs, [nor] did we want to cause distress to any fans, including children.\"\nBut it added: \"Enough is enough for us all.\"\nThey said: \"Our decision to interrupt the game was not an easy thing to do, but Sisu is destroying a community - this is more than just a football club.\"\n\"No-one is calling for violence, we are the first to disown that idea.\n\"We thought if we caused a delay it might keep us [Coventry City] in the spotlight.\n\"Does anybody think we want to never be able to watch our City play again?

a health check on the road behind us, not a snap shot of the here and now.\nThat does not mean that positive figures should be dismissed, just so much pre-referendum chaff.\nEconomic performance is based on several pillars, and two of the most important are sentiment (how confident do consumers and businesses feel) and activity (what are consumers and businesses doing, whether it's \"buying stuff\" or long-term investment decisions).\nConfident figures can boost confidence, creating something of a virtuous circle.\nToday's GDP figures are focused on the latter on those pillars, business activity, and they are the first estimate of the economic performance of the UK between April and June.\nThey show that, at least at the beginning of the quarter when business confidence was higher, the economy performed more strongly than many analysts expected.\nThe data published suggest that it was the UK's manufacturing sector that did the brunt of the heavy lifting, with industrial production rising by 2.1%.\nYou would have to go back to 1999 to find a figure that strong.\nThe much larger - and in terms of the UK economy more significant - services sector grew by 0.5%, down slightly on the previous quarter.\nCare does need to be taken with these figures.\nFirstly, they are only an initial assessment, and the data towards the end of the quarter will only be firmed up once the \"revisions\" are published over the next few weeks.\nWhat estimates we do have suggest that activity did fall off through May and June as the referendum approached.\nSecond, the figures do not contain much information on what has happened to the economy following the June 23 vote.\nAnd certainly some of the data published since then have been pretty gloomy.\nSome very senior figures I have spoken to who are close to the Treasury say that the public should not be lulled into a false sense of security.\nWhich pretty accurately reflects what the chancellor told me earlier today.\nI asked him, given the better economic news, whether those pre-referendum predictions of a possible recession following June 23 could still come to pass.\n\"I think it's far too early to say how the economy is responding yet,\" he told me.\n\"Inevitably people's reaction to a surprise [the referendum result] is caution, they tend to pause decisions.\n\"We know business confidence has taken a knock over the last few weeks.\n\"People are taking stock, working out what this all means.\n\"And I hope that we will start to see people taking those investment decisions again and start backing Britain for the future.\n\"Over the next few months we will see hard data coming through that tells us what is happening and we will then respond accordingly.\"\nThat response could be to \"reset\" policy on tax and spending, as Mr Hammond revealed last week.\nHow far he will need to go - if anywhere - is still to be seen.", "Nicola Edgington attacked Sally Hodkin, 58, with a butcher's knife in Bexleyheath, south London, in 2011.\nThe attack happened six years after Edgington had killed her own mother.\nOn the day of the murder, Edgington repeatedly called police and told A&E staff she needed to be sectioned because she felt like killing someone.\nEdgington was taken to Oxleas House mental health unit in Greenwich to be admitted, but was allowed to walk out of the unit on 10 October 2011 to commit the crime.\nShe got a bus to Bexleyheath, bought a large knife from Asda and stole a steak knife from a butcher's shop.\nShe then stabbed grandmother Mrs Hodkin and another woman in the street.\nShe was convicted of murder and attempted murder for those two attacks.\nEdgington had previously been convicted in 2006 of the manslaughter of her mother Marion at her home in Forest Row, East Sussex, and ordered to be detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act.\nThe damning report commissioned by NHS England and released on Friday found staff at the Bracton Centre, run by Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust, deemed Edgington fit for discharge after three years.\nIt said Bracton Centre staff were too willing to accept Edgington's version of events and said documents failed to detail all concerns about her behaviour before discharge.\nShe was released in 2009 and allowed to live in the community.\nAfter she was freed, Edgington was moved to accommodation with low levels of supervision and was also allowed to visit her husband in Jamaica.\nOxleas staff also failed to take seriously warnings made by her brother and sister that Edgington was still unwell and potentially dangerous, the report said.\nThe report found correspondence from the trust to the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), which approved the discharge, \"did not fully reflect\" concerns that had been raised about her disruptive, abusive and rude behaviour on the ward.\nIt also did not document her denial of any memory of killing her mother and her \"fixation on making fast progress to discharge\".\nOverall, \"reports... did not accurately reflect disruptive and aggressive behaviours described in the clinical notes\", NHS England concluded.\nThe MoJ also asked for details of any concerns during the Jamaica trip, which could have led to Edgington being readmitted to a mental health unit, but these where never handed over by the trust.\nWhen Edgington was discharged, Greenwich Police should have been informed of her release but the trust failed to forward on the paperwork, the report added.\nOn the day of the murder, when Edgington was taken to Oxleas House following several hours in A&E asking to be sectioned, a member of Oxleas staff missed an opportunity to give her the highest risk rating.\nShe was put down for 15-minute observations - a level deemed \"inadequate\" by investigators, who believed she should have had one-to-one monitoring while waiting to be admitted to the unit.\nThe report also pointed to missed opportunities by the police to section Edgington under the Mental Health Act on the day of the murder. Police staff also did not carry out a Police National Computer (PNC) check during their repeated interactions with her which would have alerted them to her conviction for manslaughter.\nMrs Hodkin's son Len, 40, a solicitor from Eltham, said Edgington should \"never have been released in the first place\" after killing her own mother and should have been \"recalled to hospital when her behaviour deteriorated\" after she was discharged.\nHe added his mother's death was \"entirely preventable\".", "The commuter was badly injured after he was struck at Kentish Town station in north London on Wednesday.\nBritish Transport Police (BTP) said a 29-year-old from Colindale, north-west London, was detained after he voluntarily attended a police station.\nHe is currently in custody and being questioned by officers.\nMore on this story and other news from London\nThe passenger was treated at the scene by London Ambulance staff before he was taken \"as a priority\" to a hospital in central London.

Later on Tuesday the jury will hear the defence speech.\nAt the High Court in Glasgow Miss Bain said: \"On April 20, Easter Sunday, Madison Horn was brutally attacked in her home and she was unable to defend herself.\n\"She was struck again and again until she was covered in bruises, her skull was fractured and she had significant internal injuries. These injuries were unsurvivable.\"\nIt is alleged Mr Park pulled Madison's hair, lifted her up and repeatedly struck her head against a wall, bit her on the body and repeatedly struck her on the head and body by means unknown to the prosecutor.\nThe court has heard Madison, who died from blunt force trauma to her head and abdomen, had 65 separate injuries including a fractured skull, tears to her liver and bruising to her head and body.\nMiss Bain added: \"The Crown contends these injuries were inflicted on Madison in the course of a brutal attack.\"\nThe prosecutor told the jury that medical experts claimed that significant force would have been required to inflict some of the injuries.\nShe spoke of two dents in the hallway of the house which Madison's mother Ann Marie White said there had not been there before she left the house about 14:00 to go to a friend's birthday party in Cowdenbeath.\nMiss Bain told the jury one of Madison's hairs was found in the cracked plaster in one of the indentations and her DNA was on both the dents.\nThe prosecutor said: \"She was only 90.5cm and the indentations were 149cm and 165cm from the floor. If she was struck against the wall she would have to be raised to that height in some way or by someone.\n\"Madison Horn had no injuries when her mother left that day.\"\nThe court has heard Mr Park called 999 at about 18:00 saying Madison's lips had turned blue.\nMiss Bain said: \"The 999 call handler said she didn't think he was performing CPR on her. She said she didn't hear anything being done. What could be more important than CPR. Why would he not do everything to save her.\"\nDefence QC Mark Stewart used his closing speech to urge the jury of nine men and six women to acquit Mr Park.\nHe described the forensic investigation of the house where Madison died in the case as \"substandard\"  and said there was \"a huge question mark\" over it.\nMr Stewart also attacked evidence given by a doctor and two pathologists during the trial saying they were dealing in speculation.\nHe  said: \"There is not one iota of evidence to suggest an attack on the child.\n\"The evidence in this case at every stage has flaws and is open to criticism. \"\nMr Stewart said that two unusual incidents happened to Madison that day.\nThe first he said was at about 10:00 or 11:00 when a walking machine fell on her injuring her stomach and the second when a bed she was jumping on collapsed and she fell from it.\nHe added: \"I don't think it is in dispute these two incidents happened where there was potential for an abdominal injury and potential for a head injury.\"\nThe QC criticised the forensic team for not examining the walking machine or the furniture in Madison's bedroom.\nThe defence counsel denied the suggestion that Mr Park was uncaring and added: \"It is wrong to suggest that Mr Park was emotionless and not concerned by what happened to the child.\n\"We heard the 999 call in which he says: 'It's my bairn, it's my bairn. Her lips have gone blue.'\n\"People respond to situations differently and at the time no-one knew how serious it was.\"\nHe told the jury they should not deal in preconceptions or suspicions to come to their decision and added: \"The Crown has not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that this child was assaulted or assaulted by Kevin Park.\"\nThe trial before judge Michael O'Grady continues.\nJudge O'Grady is expected to charge the jury on Wednesday.", "The Aslef union is in dispute with Southern's parent firm Govia Thameslink (GTR) over guards' roles on trains.\nDrivers walked out for 48 hours on Tuesday and Wednesday and more strike days are planned later this month.\nSouthern has accused the union of abusing its power but Aslef chief Mick Whelan said the firm had tried to force through changes rather than negotiate.\nAslef's next strike is planned for 24, 25 and 27 January.\nMembers are also operating an overtime ban.\nThe RMT, whose members are mostly conductors, has been involved in industrial action since last April and has announced a 24-hour strike for 23 January.\nThe RMT also represents 12 drivers who are also taking part in the Aslef action.\nThe rail operator, which is also in dispute with the RMT union, has said it will take Aslef to the Supreme Court over the industrial action.\nThe long-running dispute centres on Southern's decision to turn guards into supervisors.

He had to resign in July over corruption allegations, which he denies.\nMs Rousseff's approval ratings have plummeted from their all-time high of 79% in March 2013 to about 10% in March 2016.\nThere were mass demonstrations in major Brazilian cities demanding that she resign.\nBut there were also smaller rallies in her support.\nMany Brazilians said they were fed up with the high levels of corruption in Brazilian politics.\nBut with some of the politicians who backed her impeachment also under investigation for either mismanagement or corruption, no party seems untouched by the allegations.\nThe lower house of Congress voted on 17 April on whether impeachment proceedings against Ms Rousseff should go ahead.\nIn a late-night session, 367 out of 513 lawmakers voted in favour, comfortably reaching the two-thirds threshold needed for the matter to be passed to the Senate.\nA vote in the Senate followed in May, in which 55 senators voted in favour of the impeachment process going ahead and 22 against.\nAnother vote was held in the Senate in August which the senators decided by 59 to 21 votes that there was enough evidence against Ms Rousseff to proceed to the trial phase.\nOn 31 August, the Senate voted 61 to 20 in favour of Ms Rousseff's impeachment.\nMichel Temer, who served as Ms Rousseff's vice-president and who has been the acting president since her suspension in May, will be officially sworn in as president later on Wednesday.\nHe will serve out Ms Rousseff's term in office, which is due to end on 1 January 2019.", "Bellach, mae M\u00f4n wedi hel \u00a3412,000, sy'n trechu record Eisteddfod Sir G\u00e2r yn 2014.\nMae'r cyfanswm yn chwalu'r nod gafodd ei osod ar gyfer y brifwyl eleni, sef \u00a3325,000.\nDaeth 15,831 drwy'r giatiau ddydd Sadwrn -

higher than most modern dessert wine - and traces of arsenic.\n168 bottles were found 50m beneath the Baltic Sea in July 2010, several of them unusually well-preserved due to the stable, cold and dark conditions.\nSome of them sold at auction in 2011 for tens of thousands of euros.\nThe new study, published in the journal PNAS, reports \"chemical and sensory analysis\" of the historic liquid. It was led by Prof Philippe Jeandet, from the University of Reims in Champagne-Ardenne, France.\nProf Jeandet and his colleagues used various types of chemical analysis to compare the make-up of three bottles from the shipwreck, made by Veuve Clicquot, with bottles made recently by the same champagne house.\nHe told the BBC he only got to taste 0.1ml of the wine, as part of working with experts and winemakers at Veuve Clicquot to conduct the analysis.\n\"It was impossible to smell,\" Prof Jeandet said, because of the tiny quantity. \"But it was fabulous - just tasting 100 microlitres.\"\nHe remembers flavours of tobacco and leather, he said. \"The taste remained for two or three hours.\"\nAs part of their analysis, Prof Jeandet's team found the wine's composition was surprisingly similar to the modern samples, with some notable differences.\nFor one thing, there weren't many bubbles left. \"The CO2 remaining was less than 2g per litre. If you compare to normal champagne - the CO2 in a bottle is around 10-11g per litre,\" Prof Jeandet said.\nThis was probably because the gas gradually escaped through the corks, he added.\nApart from that loss of fizz, the conditions under the sea - a stable temperature of 2-4C, relatively low salinity, low levels of light and high pressure - served the wine remarkably well.\n\"What was most surprising... was to see that the aromas and chemical features were preserved during the time the wine spent at the bottom of the sea,\" Prof Jeandet said.\nAndrew Waterhouse, an oenologist at the University of California Davis, told the BBC the research was \"very interesting\" - making particular mention of the high sugar content the researchers reported.\n\"This is a type of wine we still drink today. So it's not an ancient relic, it's part of our current history - we do drink champagne these days.\n\"But this champagne is very different, especially with regard to sugar level.\"\nAt more than 14%, the sugar content was \"astonishingly high\", Prof Waterhouse said - higher than most dessert wines today. But it appears to have been sold, much as it is today, to be drunk at receptions and celebrations.\n\"It points out how different the tastes were back then.\"\nConsumers in the UK and the US, particularly, have driven the sugar content down over the years. Even in the 19th Century, Prof Jeandet said, tastes on the continent were much sweeter - and these Baltic bottles were probably typical.\nProf Waterhouse also pointed out the traces of arsenic the researchers spotted, which may indicate the use of arsenic salts to control pests in the vineyard, as well as surprisingly high levels of lead and iron.\nThese metals probably came from the barrels used before the wine was bottled, he added. These may have had iron fittings and brass valves, containing lead.\nFollow Jonathan on Twitter", "Police said the accident happened at about 12:10 on the A697 near to Greenlaw.\nThe man was badly hurt and has been taken to the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh for treatment.\nInquiries into the full circumstances of the incident are ongoing and anyone with information has been asked by police to come forward.", "The rally follows months of allegations that he has abused his power.\nCovert recordings released by the opposition appear to show ministers plotting vote-rigging and the covering-up of a murder.\nLast week two ministers and the head of the intelligence service resigned.\nOpposition leaders said intelligence chief Saso Mijalkov and Interior Minister Gordana Jankulovska were behind attempts to control the press, judiciary and electoral officials by tapping their phones.\nHowever, the government denies the allegations and insists the opposition is trying to destabilise the country for its own benefit.

So is 10-a-day realistically affordable?\n\"For some people it is,\" says Victoria Taylor, senior dietitian at the BHF.\n\"But for others it would take some serious thought and commitment in terms of working out which fruit and vegetables will be affordable. But it's important to keep in mind that our target is five a day and this study found that the best effects were seen for people who are currently getting below this number.\n\"The focus on 10 is, in a sense, moving the goalposts and it would be a shame if this put people off aiming for five, or even just having one more portion a day.\"\nThe British Dietetic Association says: \"What it tells us is that the benefits of eating fruit and vegetables are incremental - in other words eating five portions a day is great, but 10 a day is even better.\"\nSo any improvement in your fruit and vegetable intake is a benefit.\nVictoria Taylor says cost is not the only reason we don't eat enough fruit and veg.\n\"There are numerous factors that influence our food choice. Cost is important but so is taste, cooking skills, storage facilities and ability to get to and from the shops.  It's hard to say how much is specifically due to the price of food as all of these issues are interrelated.\"\nThe Food Foundation is hosting a conference in June bringing together businesses, farmers, retailers and government departments which aims to make it easier for people to eat vegetables.\nSome of the ideas they will be looking at are current pilots in America where if food stamps are spent on fruit and veg, they can be doubled in value so \"you create a positive incentive for people to spend their vouchers on fruit and veg because you're giving them more value\".\nAnother scheme sees people who have early stage type 2 diabetes or are pre-diabetic being prescribed fruit and veg and getting vouchers to spend in local markets \"to help them rethink their diets and get their diets on track\".\nWe asked BBC readers to send us their questions about the 10-a-day diet and then our health team wrote this piece to try to answer as many as possible.\nA lot of people asked about the cost implications of trying to achieve a 10-a-day diet.\nGary asked: \"Should fruit and vegetables be heavily subsidized by the government to encourage further consumption?\"\nGary explained to us the thinking behind his question:\n\"Simple consumer habits dictate that people consume more of something when it is cheaper. I believe the same economic principle can be applied to fruit and vegetables. When people go shopping, they have to make the choice of what to buy, and usually, the best value items win.\"\nWith concern over the cost of healthy eating, some have asked whether the government should subsidise fruit and veg?\nAt the moment, the government has \"measures in place to support low income families, pregnant women and children under four through Healthy Start Vouchers. These can be spent on milk, fresh or frozen fruit and vegetables.\"\nThey also point out that all infant pupils can now get free school meals and they've announced \u00c2\u00a310m funding a year to expand breakfast clubs in up to 1,600 schools.\nCurrently only 70% of those eligible get the healthy start vouchers and Anne Taylor says the Food Foundation will debate whether that programme should be expanded to include a broader income group or wider age range at its conference. As she points out, this \"would create a positive pull of demand - and thereby help to strengthen the British horticulture sector at the same time.\"\nAnd she thinks in the post-Brexit world there is a big opportunity to help farmers.\n\"Doesn't it make sense to join up our farming policy with our health policy and think about - could we increase consumer subsidies to really drive up demand so our horticulturalists benefit as well - it's win-win.\"\n\"There are lots of different ways we could make it easier to eat veg - which go beyond price and much more about our whole food environment and to what extent fruit and veg is a strong part of that and encouraging us to eat it.\"\nShe points out when you look at advertising only \"1% of food and soft drink advertising spend goes on fresh veg\".\nBut she believes we need to change our whole way of thinking about fruit and veg and the messages we send - even down to children's TV where, she says, it is \"demonised\".\n\"It's set against delicious and junk food or cream cakes, and fruit and veg is the yucky thing that kids don't want to eat. There's a bit of that subliminal stuff that happens in kids' TV because it's funny but it's kind of normalising that this is stuff that you don't want to be eating - so there's a job of work there beyond advertising, in broadcasting to try and not normalise that this is worthy but not tasty.\"", "It accuses army Gen Gabriel Amisi Kumba and John Numbi, an ex-police chief, of threatening the country's stability by suppressing the opposition.\nThe men, who have not commented on the allegations, have had their assets frozen in the US.\nThere have been recent protests against the postponement of presidential polls.\nThe opposition accuses President Kabila of trying to cling on to power beyond the end of his term, which is due to expire in December.\nThe US treasury said Gen Amisi had commanded units which violently suppressed opposition protests in several provinces, including one last year in which more than 40 people died.\n\"Soldiers have used excessive force and lethal weapons during demonstrations and political rallies,\" the US treasury statement said.\nMr Numbi is said to have intimidated voters to secure victories for candidates affiliated to President Kabila in elections in March for governors.\n\"Numbi threatened to kill opposition candidates who did not voluntarily withdraw from the race, and on the same day these exchanges purportedly took place, three candidates withdrew,\" the US statement said.\nUS-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) welcomed the sanctions and called for more leaders to be targeted.\n\"For the greatest impact, the US should expand sanctions to include other senior government, security, and intelligence officials responsible for brutal repression over the past two years,\" HRW researcher Ida Swayer said.\nLast week, more protests erupted in the capital, Kinshasa, after the electoral commission failed to announce a date for the election but said that it would not be possible to hold the polls in November.\nThe headquarters of three opposition parties were also torched.\nHRW says at least 50 people died in the clashes with the police, but the interior ministry put the figure at 17, including three officers.\nMeanwhile, TV channel CFTV, owned by opposition leader Vital Kamerhe, says its frequency has been revoked and given to a different operator.\nThe constitution bars Mr Kabila, who took power in 2001 following the assassination of his father Laurent Kabila, from running for office again in a country that has never had a smooth transfer of power since independence more than 55 years ago.\nA government-backed effort to work out a solution to the political crisis, called a \"national dialogue\", has been boycotted by most opposition parties.", "The most powerful non-nuclear bomb ever used by the US in combat was dropped on an IS base in Nangarhar province.\nA network of tunnels and caves was destroyed on Thursday evening local time, US officials said.\nThe death toll was confirmed to the BBC by Ismail Shinwary, the governor of Achin province within Nangarhar.\nIS had earlier said it had not suffered any casualties in the blast.\nNo civilians were killed in the explosion, Mr Shinwary said.

massive online open courses - there were suggestions that international students might prefer to study online, rather than need to have a campus built on their doorstep.\nBut universities have continued to expand overseas - taking their brands to international students.\nThere are now more than 240 international branch campuses around the world, according to figures compiled by the Cross-Border Education Research Team at the State University of New York.\nNot all have been a success, with more than 40 closures - but more than another 20 are in the pipeline to be opened.\nUniversities from the United States, the UK and France have been the biggest builders of overseas branches - accounting for more than half of the overall total.\nThese have clustered around the most lucrative and expanding markets - with China, the Gulf states, Malaysia and Singapore among the most common host countries.\nSuch international campuses allow Western universities to tap into expanding markets.\nThey can offer students a degree from a prestigious Western university, without the expense or visa barriers of studying abroad.\nAnd for universities in the UK, facing tough competition for students at home and financial uncertainties, it provides another potential source of tuition fees.\nNottingham, Liverpool, Southampton, Newcastle, Bolton, Middlesex and Reading all have international outposts.\nThis internationalisation is also raising competition within Europe, with an increasing number of courses being taught in English, with the aim of attracting more overseas students.\nUniversities in France have been making efforts to promote English-language courses to international students, including from the UK.\nWithin English-speaking countries there have also been fluctuating trends in the international student market.\nThe US and the UK have traditionally been the biggest players, but this month Canadian universities have claimed applications from overseas students are rising to \"unprecedented\" levels.\nThe reason for the sudden preference for Canada, they say, is the rise of \"isolationism\" in the US and Europe.", "But it needs to raise \u00a33m to fund the helipad, which would sit on top of a new multi-storey car park at the Queen's Medical Centre.\nNottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust said it had already received \u00a35.5m from the government for the new Medipark research facility.\nThe car park will be built using \u00a31.5m of the trust's own money.\nOnce grant money is secured, planning applications for the car park and Medipark will be lodged with Nottingham City Council.\nThe helipad, which will support the East Midlands Trauma Centre on the hospital site, will reduce the transfer time from air ambulances to between two and three minutes, the trust said.\nCurrently helicopters have to land at the university, 20 minutes away.\nAfter the helipad is built patients would be moved from the new helipad, along the hospital's private road network and into the emergency department.\nAdam Brooks, clinical lead for the trauma centre, said that in the two years since it opened, it had saved 103 lives.\n\"We have got no evidence to say we have been losing people at all but we are very keen to move people into hospital even faster,\" he said.\nMedipark - planned to be part of the Nottingham Enterprise Zone - could create hundreds of jobs over 10 years, the trust said.\nIt successfully bid for \u00a35.5m from the government and is now waiting for confirmation of a \u00a32.5m grant from the D2N2 Local Enterprise Partnership.\nDaniel Mortimer, the trust's director of workforce and strategy, said: \"We think there are real benefits of attracting that research here to be co-located with the hospital.\"\nThe trust is selling off its existing Hooley Street car park to a developer. Mr Mortimer said the new 650-space multi-storey would increase the hospital's current parking capacity by 100, making \"the world of difference\" to patients.\nThe QMC will become the first hospital in the country with a tram stop when Nottingham's tram network extension is completed. There would be a new hospital entrance to allow access from the tram stop at the south of the site.\nThe developments - the hospital's biggest since it was built in 1977 - are planned to take place over the next 18 months.", "The Xperia XZ Premium captures video at up to 960 frames per second (fps).\nThe achievement was made possible by a new type of image sensor that has built-in memory of its own.\nSony's smartphone market share is small, but it usually makes its sensors available to rivals about six to 12 months after they debut.\nApple, Samsung, LG and Xiaomi are among those to have used its technology in recent handsets.\nThe new phone was unveiled alongside several lower specification devices on the first day of the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona.\n\"Despite this being one of the best devices at MWC, I don't see it changing Sony's fortunes,\" commented Francisco Jeronimo, from the market research firm IDC.\n\"If you go through Sony's financial statements you can see it now makes more money from selling phone cameras to its competitors than selling its own smartphones, which is quite remarkable\n\"So, its phones are a way to show off its capabilities, and the new camera is outstanding - not just the slow-mo but also the picture quality.\"\nSony shipped about half as many smartphones in 2016 as the previous year and has about 1% share of the market, according to IDC, putting it in 17th place.\nNokia 3310 mobile phone resurrected\nSamsung unveils tablets but no phones\nLG G6 phone is made for split-screen apps\nHuawei P10 has smarter selfie camera\nGoogle brings Assistant to more Android phones\nBlackberry revives classic keyboard phone\nSony calls the new technology Motion Eye.\nIt uses a three-layer stacked sensor fitted with one gigabit of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Doing so lets the component temporarily store a rapid burst of video data locally before it is transferred to other memory components, which takes more time.\nWhen the firm first announced the sensor earlier this month it said it was capable of 1,000 fps in 1080p \"full high definition\".\nHowever, on the Xperia XZ Premium it has been restricted to slightly fewer frames per second at 720p resolution.\nIn practice, users can only capture 0.18 seconds of footage at this speed, which produces six seconds of video when played back.\nBut they can do so in the middle of filming normal footage to create a slow-down-and-speed-back-up effect. The challenge is to press the button at the right moment.\n\"It's only a very brief amount of time and you've got to be really on the ball to use it effectively,\" commented Tim Coulling from the Canalys tech consultancy.\n\"But it's a great feature.\"\nThe built-in DRAM memory also lets users record action that happened a second before they pressed the record button.\nThis buffer function is intended to help them avoid missed moments, but only works if the device detects motion, which triggers the facility.\nOther unusual features include:\nAnalysts were less positive about another of the Japanese firm's announcements.\nSony confirmed its Xperia Touch projector would go on sale later \"this Spring\".\nThe Android-powered device was first teased at last year's MWC.\nThe machine uses ultrashort-throw projection technology to display apps on a nearby wall or table. The resulting 720p image can be configured to be between 23in to 80in (58.4cm to 203.2cm) in size.\nBuilt-in sensors let the surface used act like a large touchscreen.\nSony says it expects families to \"huddle\" around the image when using it, and showed the BBC a multiplayer game where several players interacted with graphics projected onto a table at once.\nThe machine is designed to be used while connected to a power source, but can work for up to an hour unplugged.\nA potential problem, however, is its price: Sony plans to charge \u00e2\u201a\u00ac1,499 ($1,584; \u00c2\u00a31,269) when it goes on sale in Europe and Japan.\n\"I think Sony should be applauded for being bold enough to push into a new category, but unfortunately it's out of reach to all but the most affluent gadget addicts,\" commented Ben Wood from CCS Insight.\nMr Jeronimo was more harsh in his criticism.\n\"It's a huge mistake,\" he said.\n\"If Sony combined a projector with a device like the Amazon Echo or Google Home for a third of the price, that would be a very interesting.\n\"But asking for more than $1,500 - there's no way they will sell them.\"", "Proposals by four artists for the Parker's Piece statue can be seen in the Grand Arcade on Monday.\nAn idea to create a Subbuteo-type referee was scrapped before the public consultation stage last year.\nCity councillor Carina O'Reilly said the statue could become a \"significant landmark\" for the city.\nIt has been claimed the original rules of football were developed by students playing on Parker's Piece in 1848 and that the city centre green is the birthplace of football.\nA plaque at the city centre park already celebrates how the \"Cambridge Rules\" became the \"defining influence on the 1863 Football Association rules\".\nThe Football Association, however, said although \"elements\" of the Cambridge Rules were in its own version, there were \"a number of differences\".\nArtists Neville Gabie together with Alan Ward, Kenny Hunter, Nayan Kulkarni and Mark Titchner have submitted proposals.\nThey include a granite slab inscribed with the rules in different languages, a mirror-like design and bench, a life-size bronze of a female referee and a word sculpture.\nPeople are now being asked for their opinions on the designs until 5 December.\nOne sculpture will be chosen by city councillors on 15 January.\nThe work, which could cost up to \u00c2\u00a3115,000, will be paid for by ring-fenced public art money from developers.", "David Cameron outlined his case in the Commons for allowing the RAF to bomb the Islamic State terror group in Syria as well as in Iraq.\nBut the SNP's Angus Robertson said there was no effective ground support in place to take and hold territory.\nAnd he said there was no fully-costed reconstruction plan in place for Syria.\nMr Cameron had said that there were about 70,000 \"moderate\" Free Syrian Army (FSA) troops as well Kurdish fighters who could work with the UK to \"help eliminate\" IS.\nBut Mr Robertson, the SNP's leader at Westminster, questioned how many of those FSA fighters were on the frontline against Daesh - another name for IS - in the north east of Syria as opposed to countering Syrian regime forces elsewhere in the country.\nHe also asked Mr Cameron what the UK was doing to plan and secure long-term stability and reconstruction in Syria.\nMr Robertson said: \"The UK spent 13 times more bombing Libya than on its post-conflict stability and reconstruction. So how much does the prime minister estimate the total cost of reconstruction will be, and does he think that the amount in his statement today will be sufficient?\n\"Two years ago the prime minister urged us to bomb the opponents of Daesh in Syria. That would probably have strengthened this terrorist organisation. Today, the prime minister wants us to launch a bombing campaign without effective ground support in place or a fully-costed reconstruction and stability plan.\n\"The prime minister has asked us to consider his plan. We have listened closely. However, key questions posed by the Foreign Affairs Select Committee remain unanswered.\n\"And unless the prime minister answers these questions satisfactorily, the Scottish National Party will not vote for airstrikes in Syria.\"\nMr Robertson said the SNP shared concerns about the \"terrorist threat\" from IS, and that the party strongly supported a ceasefire in Syria and a political solution to the Syrian conflict.\nScottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is also the SNP leader, has previously said that the party would listen to what the prime minister had to say before making a decision on whether or not to support airstrikes.\nHer predecessor, Alex Salmond, has said that the party believes a United Nations resolution would be required before it was able to back Mr Cameron on airstrikes.\nLast month, the SNP conference unanimously backed a motion which was opposed to airstrikes in Syria.\nA Commons vote is expected within weeks on whether to authorise a bombing campaign, with the SNP's 54 MPs having the potential to play a crucial role.\nSpeaking in the Commons after publishing his response to a recent Foreign Affairs committee report on air strikes, Mr Cameron said that there was a \"clear legal basis\" for military action against IS in Syria.\nHe said this was because the UN Security Council had passed a resolution stating that IS \"constitutes a global and unprecedented threat to international peace and security\", and calling upon member states to take \"all necessary measures to prevent and suppress terrorist acts committed\" by the group and to \"eradicate the safe haven they have established over significant parts of Iraq and Syria\".\nThe prime minister argued that it was in the national interest of the UK to carry out air strikes against IS militants in Syria.\nHe said that military action should be part of a \"comprehensive strategy\" to tackle IS, which would also require a \"full political settlement\".\nThe prime minister dismissed fears that that UK would become a bigger target for terror attacks if it was to bomb in Syria by saying that the UK was already a major target for IS - and that the only way to deal with that was to \"take action\" now.", "EU president Herman Van Rompuy said after a day of emergency talks in Brussels that members would \"explore the possibility of limited change\".\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron said he had sought assurances to protect Britain's interest if there is change.\nAnother meeting of all the EU countries will be held on Wednesday.\nOn Sunday morning the leaders of all the European Union's 27 members held talks about the Greek debt crisis, recapitalising banks, and bolstering the bailout fund.\nThis was followed in the afternoon by a separate meeting of the 17 nations that use the euro.\nSpeaking after the meeting, Mr Van Rompuy said that altering the treaty was under discussion. Although no proposed details were given, any change is likely to involve closer fiscal and economic cooperation.\n\"The aim is deepening our economic convergence and strengthening economic discipline,\" Mr Van Rompuy said.\nHe said the words 'limited change' meant \"not a general overhaul of the institutional architecture.

I have secured a commitment today that we must safeguard the interests of countries that want to stay outside the euro, particularly with respect to the integrity of the single market for all 27 countries of the EU.\"\nThe Prime Minister said the EU needed to build on the progress of the work done on Saturday on recapitalising the banks.\n\"More progress is needed,\" he said. \"I think we are beginning to see the elements of a strong package coming together.\"\nMr Cameron has cancelled visits to Japan and New Zealand this week in order to attend Wednesday's summit of EU members.\nInitially only the 17 countries that use the euro were to meet on Wednesday.\nSpeaking alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a joint press conference on Sunday afternoon, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said \"a quite broad agreement is taking shape on the reinforcement\" of the EFSF bailout fund.\nMrs Merkel said a French idea for the fund to acquire a banking licence was dead, leaving a mix of plans to use the EFSF to offer insurance to eurozone bond holders, and moves to create a 'fund within the fund' that would be topped up by some of the main emerging nations.\nBy Robert PestonBusiness editor, BBC News\nRead Robert's blog\nThere are also discussions with banks for them to accept a 50% write-off on Greek debt, in exchange for a new bailout by the EU and the International Monetary Fund.\nAll of the initial proposals reached over the weekend of talks need to be ratified by the 27 member at the full summit on Wednesday.\nBefore the start of Sunday's meetings, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou urged Europe to \"act decisively and effectively\" to contain the troubles.\n\"It's been proven now that the crisis is not a Greek crisis,\" he told reporters. \"The crisis is a European crisis. So now is the time that we as Europeans need to act decisively and effectively.\"\nShortly before the summit began, Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi held private talks with EU President Herman Van Rompuy, Mrs Merkel, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy.\nThere is concern that budget cuts passed by the Italian parliament do not go far enough.\nOn Saturday eurozone finance ministers struck a provisional deal that will see banks raise more than 100bn euros (\u00c2\u00a387bn) in new capital to shield them against possible losses to indebted countries.\nIt is conditional on a wider accord, including a write-down of Greek debt.\nBBC business editor Robert Peston said the 100bn euros agreed in the deal will be provided to banks by commercial investors, national governments and the EU's bailout fund.\nSpeaking after the 10-hour meeting on Saturday, Mr Osborne said: \"Britain will keep up pressure in the next few days to a comprehensive package to resolve the European crisis and to make sure that we get jobs and growth.\"\nDebt-laden Greece has been bailed out - twice - along with the Irish Republic and Portugal.\nThe eurozone is working on a third package for Greece, as well as a solution that could help the much bigger economies of Spain and Italy, which are faltering.", "Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh were given the death penalty by a court in 2013.\nRejecting their appeal, Justice R Banumathi said the men committed \"a barbaric crime\" that had \"shaken society's conscience\".\nThe brutal gang rape led to nationwide outrage and new anti-rape laws.\nThe 23-year-old physiotherapy student was attacked on a bus that she had boarded with her male friend as they returned home from watching a film in December 2012.

They're literally at the beginning of their careers.\"\nRossetti was already engaged to Lizzie Siddell, another great pre-Raphaelite beauty.\nJane married his friend William Morris, later to gain fame as a socialist writer and artist.\nThe poet Swinburne, also at Oxford, wrote of her: \"The idea of his marrying her is insane.\n\"To kiss her feet is the utmost man should think of doing.\"\nBut after Siddell's death, Rossetti and Jane Morris began an affair that spanned most of her life.\nAt the top of a Rossetti painting of Morris, he wrote in Latin: \"Famous for her poet husband, and famous for her face, may my picture add to her fame.\"\nThe two pictures now at auction recall her fame again.\nIn the 1861 drawing, Rossetti depicts Morris as Lachesis, one of the three mythological fates, spinning the thread of life.\nThe auction house said it could be seen \"as a hidden allusion to her power to determine his destiny on both personal and artistic levels\".\nBy the time of the painting from 1872, never before sold, Rossetti's depiction of his lover as Proserpine was far more sexualised.\n\"You see the distinctive voluptuous lips.\n\"It's not a finished study - you can see the blue underdrawing, showing his technique\", Ms Drummond said.\nThe woman in the pictures represented a triumph of re-invention.\nShe was born Jane Burden in St Helen's Passage off Holywell Street in Oxford, now marked with a blue plaque.\nShe was the daughter of a stableman who worked at Symond's Livery Stable.\nHer mother was illiterate - a far cry from Morris' later fluent French and Italian, coupled with a notoriety for having \"Queenly\" manners.", "Mr Strauss-Kahn resigned as IMF managing director in 2011, after being accused of a rape at a New York hotel - allegations which were later dismissed.\nHe will join a newly-formed supervisory board at Bank Credit-Dnepr.\nMr Pinchuk is the son-in-law of former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and is reported to be worth $1.4bn (\u00c2\u00a31bn).\nDuring the 1990s he built Interpipe into one of Ukraine's biggest industrial firms, making steel, pipes, wheels and axles.\nSince then Mr Pinchuk has diversified into other industries, including banking.\nLast month he settled a dispute with two other Ukrainian businessmen, over the 2004 purchase of a mining company in Ukraine.\nThe case, due to be heard in London, was expected to be one of the most expensive court cases in English legal history and promised to reveal details about the business dealings of some of Ukraine's wealthiest men.\nIt was settled just days before the trial was due to begin.\nIn 2012 Mr Strauss-Kahn faced allegations of pimping. The case became known as the Carlton Affair, named after the Lille hotel where sex parties took place.\nMr Strauss-Kahn acknowledged attending the parties, but always denied knowing that some of the women who took part were prostitutes.\nHe was acquitted in 2015.", "A two-year-old boy also suffered serious head injuries in the crash in Birmingham.\nThe driver of a black Vauxhall Astra ran from the scene in Eastfield Road, Bordesley Green, after crashing with a red Ford Fiesta.\nThe driver of the Fiesta was eight weeks pregnant. Another child, a four-year-old boy, suffered minor injuries.\nMore on this and other Birmingham stories\nPC John Slater, from West Midland Police's traffic collision investigation unit, said: \"Tragically the woman was in the early stages of pregnancy at the time and as a result of the collision suffered a miscarriage.\n\"I would like to hear form anyone who may have seen the crash to call police on 101.\n\"I would also ask that the driver does the right thing and makes contact with the police.\"\nPolice said the crash happened on Saturday 2 April at 15.25 BST.", "In a wide-ranging interview about his life and career, the peer said that if the Labour Party does not work, it was \"no good for working class people\".\nHe said he was chosen to lead his party because he was \"of the left\" but was also \"sane and sensible\".\nHe led the party from October 1983 until its 1992 general election defeat.\nThe peer, who succeeded Michael Foot as Labour leader following the party's 1983 defeat, is widely regarded as having been a transitional leader, saving Labour from near political oblivion and helping to sow the seeds of New Labour.\nHe told BBC Parliament he still believed that socialism was \"the way to emancipate the world\" but accepted that he had ended up talking much about common sense and realism.\n\"You can enchant people by ideological flights of fancy, but that's not going to help them at all,\" he told BBC Parliament.\nHe said his \"greatest guide\", Nye Bevan, had based the NHS on a working model of \"collective provision of quality healthcare\" paid for by worker contributions in Tredegar, the town he came from.\n\"That showed that socialism had to work in practice, or it was a decoration and being a socialist was nothing better than a hobby.\"\nHe also revealed the frustration he felt during the latter years of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's governments: \"They allowed themselves to lose impetus because \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 underneath it all, confidence was declining, and I regret that because these were good, talented people with a noble cause.\"\nHe said he tried to explain his concerns to Mr Blair at the time, \"but I simply got agreement, and there is nothing more infuriating than getting agreement and no action\", he said.\nLord Kinnock also gave an insight into the challenge he had as leader of the opposition during the time Margaret Thatcher was prime minister.\n\"I could never really tackle her in the way in which I was able to tackle John Major, a man of the same age and same kind of background.\n\"If I misjudged it with Margaret Thatcher and even managed to land a blow, the consequences would not be full credit\", he added.\nLord Kinnock said his difficulties may have been due to his upbringing or \"innate courteous deference\".\n\"I knew that, in my choice of language and in my choice of targets, I had to take a degree of care.\"\nThe Labour peer said his socialist values were formed growing up in the valleys of south Wales, where his father was a miner and his mother a district nurse.\nLord Kinnock - who stood down as Labour leader after the party lost the 1992 general election - went on to became a European Commissioner from 1995 to 2004.\nHe said he still grieves over the UK's vote to leave the EU in June's referendum, but understands people's motivations for voting for Brexit.\n\"I understand why they accepted the absolutely false prospectus that was hurled at them for over 30 years by newspapers and some politicians, and latterly those who argued for the Leave campaign.\n\"The awful reality is the people who will suffer most\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 will be a lot of the people who voted to leave because they were taught to become obsessed with immigration, particularly in areas where there is no immigration.\"\nThe programme - Conversations - is available to view on BBC iPlayer.", "Born in a refugee camp after his parents fled the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, Khiev grew up in the US after being granted asylum, and had joined a gang by the age of 13.\nAt 16, Khiev was involved in a shoot-out in which two people were shot and injured. As a result, he was convicted of attempted murder and spent the next 14 years in jail.\n\"I remember someone telling me it takes only a couple of seconds to make a mistake, but it takes a lifetime to correct it. I'm still paying for my mistakes now,\" Khiev said.\nBecause he was not a US citizen, Khiev was deported to Cambodia, a country he had never visited before, on his release from prison.\n\"There was happiness when I first came back [to Cambodia], but there was also confusion, anger, bitterness and a huge fear,\" Khiev said.\n\"I've always wanted to come back to Cambodia - I just didn't think that it would be in this way.\"\nKhiev discovered poetry while in prison in the US. He has since established himself as a poet in Cambodia, representing his country at the Poetry Parnassus, a festival held as part of the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad.\nKhiev, who describes himself as \"a spoken word artist, an immigrant and an exile\", says his story began in a refugee camp in Thailand.\n\"My parents fled during the aftermath of the Khmer Rouge war,\" he said. \"My mum saw her first husband executed in front of her, and the only thing she buried was a piece of his fractured skull.\"\nAt the age of one, Khiev was accepted, along with his grandmother, mother and six siblings, to the US as refugees. However, they were separated from his father, who was not accepted to the US.\n\"I always thought my father was dead, I didn't know he was alive until I was 25,\" Khiev said.\nLife in the US was difficult, and Khiev said his sense of isolation contributed to his joining a gang.\n\"I remember we were living in this two-bedroom apartment, the nine of us, trying to make ends meet.\"\n\"I started hanging with guys that were coming from the same background as me, who felt like they were alone in the world.\"\nKhiev was sentenced to 16 years in prison for his involvement in a shoot-out.\nWhile Khiev says he regrets his actions, he is also unhappy about the way he was sentenced.\n\"I'm not proud of hurting anyone. I wish I never did. But I got locked up at 16, and I got tried as an adult... why would you throw away the key? Then you're saying that this kid has no more redemption.\"\nThe two people who were shot \"didn't die, thank goodness, and they're well now\", Khiev said.\nKhiev spent time in nine different prisons, and describes parts of his time in prison, where he witnessed violent riots, as \"crazy\" and \"like a battleground\".\n\"When you're in an environment of monsters you almost become a monster in order to survive.\"\nHe was eventually released after serving 14 years of his term.\nAlthough unhappy with much of his experience in prison, Khiev said one of his most transformative moments came when he was locked in solitary confinement for his involvement in a fight.\n\"They kept me in the hole [solitary confinement] for one and a half years. I almost went crazy,\" he said.\n\"You come to talk to yourself, and you're forced to confront yourself, all parts of yourself. It made me say - is this it? Is this all your life is going to amount to? Are you going to die in prison?\"\n\"I wrote everything out, fears, hopes, dreams and nightmares.\"\n\"Whatever I was writing I would talk it out, and people [in the other solitary confinement cells] would hear me and say: 'Let us hear something man'\".\n\"In a sense it was my first performance - it was dudes just being lonely and bored.\"\nOn his release from solitary confinement, he met other poets, and took part in poetry classes in an Arts in Corrections programme.\n\"I discovered the power that poetry has to change a person's perspective and outlook,\" he said.\nKhiev took part in outreach programmes speaking to young people at risk of offending, and worked as a facilitator in The Prison Peace Project, a corrections programme.\nKhiev said he \"felt his calling\" during the outreach programmes. Following his release, finding out that he would be deported to Cambodia was difficult to accept.\n\"I had all these dreams, all these plans [in the US],\" he said. \"When I first came to Cambodia I didn't know what I was going to do.\"\n\"I worked in a cinema as a movie projectionist, and on my day off I was teaching volunteering, trying to do creative stuff. It was hard, until I got mixed up with Studio Revolt [a local arts studio].\"\nKhiev says he cried when he received the invitation to perform as part of the London 2012 Olympics.\n\"I was homeless at that time - I had quit my projectionist job to do my art... I was sleeping on people's couches or staying up all night riding around. I was about to go back to the cinema, it was getting so hard.\"\n\"And finally I got the letter of invitation, and I couldn't believe it. [Performing in London] was an amazing experience.\"\nKhiev dreams of being able to return to the US and reunite with his family one day, although for now, Khiev is working as an artist-in-residence at Studio Revolt, and running poetry workshops with young people.\n\"Now I've come back, I just want to do good,\" he said. \"I just want people, when they talk to me, to get the feeling that this guy is doing good. And just continue forward, you know?\"", "The Fast & Furious franchise has become one of Hollywood's biggest hits thanks to its reliable formula of high-speed chases, underground gangs and thrilling stunts.\nAt the heart of the high-octane drama in five out of the six films was Paul Walker, who played Brian O'Conner.\nWalker was brought up as a Mormon near Los Angeles and it was his parents who pushed him into modelling and acting.\nWhen his mother, a model, started taking him to her photoshoots as a toddler, he ended up getting more work than she did. The young Walker went on to appear in adverts throughout his time in elementary school.\nHis father was not in showbusiness - he was a sewer contractor. \"My parents never looked at my acting as a career,\" Walker said. \"They saw it as a way to help provide for the household.\"\nWalker's real passion, though, was surfing. That led him to study as a marine biologist at college, but he soon dropped out to pursue a life of, as he once put it, \"smoking and living out of a garage\".\nThe acting world called once more when his former agent looked him up to ask him to audition for a role as a surfer in the CBS spiritual drama Touched By An Angel.\nA week later, he got a small part in the time-travel caper movie Pleasantville, which starred Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon.\n\"I figured that acting was a great way to make money so I could continue surfing and avoid real responsibility,\" Walker later said.\nHis roles gradually got bigger as he appeared in films like Varsity Blues, playing a high school football star; She's All That, a lightweight teen love story; and The Skulls, about a murky secret society on an Ivy League college campus.\nThe Skulls was produced by Neal Moritz and directed by Rob Cohen, who told him he reminded them of a young Steve McQueen and encouraged him to take his acting more seriously.\nSo when Moritz and Cohen came to cast their next film, set in the underground street racing scene of Southern California, they turned to Walker.\n\"They told me I could play a cop, drive fast cars, make out with a beautiful leading lady and they'd actually pay me,\" the actor said. \"I mean, hey, man, a young guy's fantasy come true.\"\nIn The Fast and the Furious, Walker appeared as the undercover cop who infiltrates a street-racing gang led by Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel.\nThe film was a surprise smash hit, with its first weekend takings in North America surpassing its $38m (\u00c2\u00a323m) budget.\nWalker recalled: \"Neal Moritz called me [on the] opening night screaming, 'It's a cultural phenomenon!'\"\nWhen Vin Diesel bowed out of the sequel after a pay dispute, Walker moved centre stage. This time, his character used his street-racing abilities to bust a Miami money-laundering cartel.\nThe franchise looked set to be short-lived when Walker sat out the third instalment. A fourth film seemed likely to go straight to DVD until Diesel and Walker agreed to return.\nA fifth and sixth were made, with the pair teaming up for ever more elaborate high-speed escapades across the world. The series' success grew again, with the sixth film the most popular yet.\nFilming has started on a seventh, and just before his death Walker even said the studio had plans to take the total to 10 Fast & Furious films over the next decade.\nIn between filming that franchise, Walker's other movies included the festive drama Noel; the diving thriller Into the Blue, alongside Jessica Alba; Eight Below, about an Antarctic husky trainer who has to rescue his stranded dogs; and World War II film Flags of Our Fathers.\nHis latest movie Hours, in which he plays a father struggling in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, is due out later this month.\nOutside the film studio, Walker set up his own charity to help the victims of natural disasters. Reach Out Worldwide has sent teams of skilled volunteers to help after earthquakes in Haiti and Chile, a tsunami in Indonesia in 2010 and the recent Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.\nIt was while attending a fundraising event for Reach Out Worldwide on Saturday that Walker died. He was a passenger in a Porsche that crashed, killing the car's driver as well as the actor.\nWalker is survived by his 15-year-old daughter Meadow.", "In a co-ordinated operation, five were arrested in Greater Manchester in dawn raids on Monday, while a 29-year-old Iranian man was held in Northampton.\nAnother Iranian man, 29, was detained in Glasgow.\nOn Tuesday, a British woman, 46, and a 33-year-old Iranian man were arrested at Manchester Airport.

Those smaller than 5mm are referred to as micro-plastics. The term also covers plastic micro-beads from personal care products.\nScientists have been worried that these tiny fragments can build up in the guts of marine creatures and can also leach toxic chemicals.\nTo look at the impact of micro-plastics on the early life stages of fish, Swedish researchers exposed perch larvae to different concentrations of polystyrene in water tanks.\nIn the absence of micro-plastics, about 96% of the eggs successfully hatched. This dropped to 81% for those exposed to large quantities.\nThe fish that did hatch in these waters with high quantities of micro-plastics were \"smaller, slower, and more stupid\" than those that hatched in clean waters, lead author Dr Oona Lonnstedt, from Uppsala University, said.\nWhen exposed to predators, about half the young perch from clean waters survived for 24 hours. Those that had been raised with the strongest plastic concentrations were all consumed by pike over the same period.\nMost surprising for the research team was the way that plastic changed food preferences.\n\"They all had access to zooplankton and yet they decided to just eat plastic in that treatment. It seems to be a chemical or physical cue that the plastic has, that triggers a feeding response in fish,\" Dr Lonnstedt told BBC News.\n\"They are basically fooled into thinking it's a high-energy resource that they need to eat a lot of.  I think of it as unhealthy fast food for teenagers, and they are just stuffing themselves.\"\nIn the study, the researchers link the decline of species such as perch and pike, observed in the Baltic Sea over the past two decades, to increased deaths at the juvenile stage. They argue that if plastics are impacting young fish across species, it could have \"profound effects\" on ecosystems.\nOther researchers said the new study was an important step forward in understanding the mechanisms of impact on marine species.\n\"The observations we have so far are about the amount of plastic we find in the seas, and the amount we find within animals,\" commented Dr Erik Van Sebille from Imperial College London.\n\"Your intuition would say it is not good for a fish to eat plastic, but scientifically you want to prove it, you want to be able to show what the impacts plastic are having, and that has been very hard to determine until now, and that's why this is such a big paper.\"\nThe US has banned the use of plastic micro-beads in cosmetic and personal care products and there is growing pressure in the UK and Europe to do the same.\n\"It's body care products, it's not just toothpaste and scrubbers; some mascara and some lipsticks have plastic in them too,\" said Dr Lonnstedt.\n\"It's a silent threat that we haven't really thought about before. We need to ban the products that have micro-beads in them.\"\nMinisters in the UK have already said that if the EU cannot adopt a common position on the issue then Britain is prepared to ban them unilaterally.\nThe House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee will be questioning witnesses about micro-plastics next week.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc and on Facebook.", "Stocks date back to at least the time of the Black Death in the 14th Century. Labourers were banned from leaving their homes to find better wages elsewhere and those who broke the law were put in stocks.\nEvery town or village was required by law to have a set. But being put in the stocks was a fairly minor punishment. Many places had whipping posts, pillories and even gallows.\nHere's a ghoulish tour of England's harsh past.\nStocks were used to hold the legs of miscreants - usually vagabonds or drunkards - while people threw rotten vegetables at them.\nSome places specified only \"soft material\" was thrown, effectively preventing victims from being stoned (or potatoed?) to death.\nDavid Bretherton, the driving force behind Thame's whimsy, insists being put in the stocks wasn't always nasty.\n\"If the person was well-liked they might have been showered with flowers. In other cases, they would have had their shoes and socks removed and their feet tickled.\"\nMost stocks were wooden and therefore susceptible to rot - although in some villages they were metallic.\nIron stocks in West Derby village were placed in their current position in 1902 to commemorate the coronation of Edward VII, which is a tribute rarely seen today.\nThe phrase \"laughing stock\" - defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"an object of general ridicule\" probably didn't originate from the use of stocks, etymologists say.\nA \"stock\" in that sense was an archaic word for a branchless tree stump or post and came to represent a person who was laughed at.\nOften confused with stocks, pillories are further up the medieval punishment rankings. Whereas stocks hold the legs, pillories hold the neck and wrists.\nWriter Daniel Defoe was put in a pillory on three days in July 1703, following the publication of The Shortest Way with the Dissenters, which was deemed seditious libel.\nAccording to History Today's Richard Cavendish, Defoe \"was put for an hour each time in three of the busiest places in London - outside the Royal Exchange in Cornhill (near his own home), near the conduit in Cheapside and finally in Fleet Street by Temple Bar.\n\"It seems to have been raining steadily most of the time, which though uncomfortable would have kept the crowds down, and the experience proved more of a triumph than an ordeal,\" he says.\n\"All that was thrown at him were flowers while his friends sold the spectators copies of The Shortest Way and [a new work] A Hymn to the Pillory which he had composed for the occasion.\"\nDefoe's experience, though, was atypical. Some people, having been pelted with dead cats and dogs, stones, saucepans and other missiles - as well as rotten fruit and eggs - were maimed or even killed, Mr Cavendish says.\nA gibbet can be any instrument of public execution, including guillotine, executioner's block, impalement stake, hanging gallows, or related scaffold, but \"gibbeting\" is specifically using a gallows to display the body of an executed criminal. Winter's Gibbet in Elsdon, in Northumberland, is where a man called William Winter was suspended in chains after being hanged in Newcastle in 1792 for the murder of an old woman.\nApparently, his rotting corpse dangled there for many years, until the structure fell apart. In 1867 a replica was built on the site, complete with a wooden mannequin. The body was stolen but a wooden head remains.\nPieces of the gibbet were once reputed to be able to cure toothache, if rubbed on the gums.\nThe remains of an original set of gallows can be seen in Potsford Woods near Wickham Market in Suffolk.\nThe story goes that a Jonah Snell bludgeoned to death a man and his son while they were working. When he was captured he was still carrying the murder weapon and was sentenced to death.\nReports claim that he was dragged up to the hanging frame on his back, giving the name \"Dragarse\" to the hill on which it stands.\nThere's a replica guillotine in Halifax, which harks back to the time when the town was a major producer of cloth.\nThe fabric had to be dried in the open air and was therefore easy to steal, so as a deterrent the crime became punishable by death in some cases.\nThe theft of items above a certain value led to a beheading. Between 1541 and 1650, 53 men and women were executed this way.\nThe replica was built in 1974 on the original site in Gibbet Street. A casting from the original blade is on display at the Bankfield Museum in Boothtown.\nA complete ducking stool is on display in Leominster Priory, Herefordshire, and the people of the town are so taken with the idea that the town clock, commissioned for the millennium, features a moving ducking stool depiction.\nIt was a wooden or iron armchair on to which the culprit was strapped. The chair was attached to a long wooden beam, usually located alongside a pond or river, and was lowered into the water.\nThe last recorded ducking cases in England are both from Leominster. Jenny Pipes, a notorious scold, was dunked in 1809. By 1817, the water in the ducking pond was so low Sarah Leeke was merely wheeled round the town in the chair.\nThe tumbrel (the wagonny bit) of a ducking stool is in the crypt of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick.\nThere is also a ducking chair in Canterbury where the High Street meets the River Stour.\nGeoffrey Abbott, author of Book of Execution, Rack, Rope, and Red-Hot Pincers, says: \"Repeated duckings routinely proved fatal, the victim dying of shock or drowning.\"\nA replica ducking stool can be seen (and posed next to) in Ducking Stool Lane in Christchurch, Dorset.\nThere was also an instrument called a cucking stool - alternatively known as a \"scolding stool\" or a \"stool of repentance\". It was a chair placed in public view, upon which the targeted person was forced to sit while being paraded through the town.\nThe village of Stow in Lincolnshire still has a whipping post situated near the church.\nWhile the people of Norton in Shropshire were clearly of an efficient bent, as they combined their stocks and whipping post.\nThey are opposite the building, which was used as the

By letting him go, the South African authorities disregarded the urgent requests of the ICC, backed by the UN secretary general, in addition to an injunction of their own High Court.\nHowever, more than that, South Africa's defiant attitude represents a power-play by the African states in their attempts to rein in the ICC.\nThe African National Congress government argues that the ICC has become outdated. This view reflects a trend within the African Union (AU).\nAll of the nine country situations addressed by the Court are African ones. To the AU states, this demonstrates a northern or western bias in the choice of cases to pursue.\nOf course, there is a simple answer to this challenge: that the worst situations of abuse meant to be addressed by the ICC are, in fact, taking place in Africa.\nThe ICC is bound to focus on the most prominent cases of serious and widespread violations of the most fundamental human rights.\nMoreover, four out of the nine country situations are instances of self-referrals.\nThat is to say, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and Mali positively invited the Court to become active. The choice of these cases cannot therefore be credited to biased court officials.\nTwo further situations, Sudan and Libya, were referred to the Court by Security Council action. Hence, only three out of the nine situations were actually taken up at the Court's own initiative.\nQ&A: International Criminal Court\nThe West did in fact lead the way when the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia was created for its own region, then beset by violence.\nThe tribunal was, in many ways, the precursor and model for the ICC, which was established to universalise this experience.\nThat said, the African Union can draw some ammunition from the attitude of the US when arguing that the Court applies double standards.\nThe US achieved many safeguards against the use of the Court against its own service-members in the Rome negotiations (which established the Court) without ever signing up to the Statute.\nIt has concluded around 100 special agreements with states, some of them African, obliging them not to co-operate with the ICC in relation to the US.\nWhen adopting the Sudan resolution, the US made sure that its own military personnel deployed for peacekeeping in Darfur would be beyond the reach of the Court.\nIn its criticism of the Court, the African Union has also focused on the fact that the ICC has had no hesitations in indicting serving heads of states.\nThis has raised the ire within an organisation still featuring a significant number of old-style autocratic regimes.\nTo them, the indictment against Col Muammar Gaddafi during the Arab Spring conflict in Libya represented an intervention by the UN Security Council and the ICC in the affairs of a sovereign state.\nWhile the AU was powerless in relation to Libya, it did attempt to intervene in the proceedings concerning Kenya.\nUhuru Kenyatta had been indicted in 2009 on charges of having organised ethnic violence after the contested elections of December 2007. He was elected president in 2013. Considerable pressure was applied by the AU to relieve him of the ensuing trial at The Hague.\nThe AU attempted to persuade the UN Security Council to use its extraordinary powers and suspend ICC action on Kenyatta, initially for one year, in the interest of peace and security. This attempt failed.\nThe AU responded by pointing to the emerging \"sense of lack of consideration of a whole continent\". A campaign was then mounted to move Kenyatta's trial to Kenya, or at least to Arusha, the seat of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.\nThere was also pressure, resisted by the Court, to excuse the accused from his own trial, given his responsibilities as president.\nOf course, it is part of the concept of ending impunity that the accused should be formally confronted with the evidence in person and in public.\nIn the end, the Court was overruled by the Assembly of States Parties (the management oversight and legislative body of the ICC), who caved in to these demands and changed the applicable court rules, allowing those fulfilling \"extraordinary public duties\" at a high level to absent themselves from the proceedings.\nWhile these manoeuvres took place, more and more witnesses reportedly fell silent or disappeared. In the end, the trial collapsed for lack of evidence. The AU had won.\nThe Bashir case has also become a focus of action of the AU, which has formed a Special Commission on relations with the ICC.\nThe AU has threatened to \"take any further decisions or measures that may be necessary in order to preserve and safeguard peace, security and stability, as well as the dignity, sovereignty and integrity of the continent\".\nThis is taken by many as a threat of a mass walkout from Rome, most likely designed to obtain further changes in the Statute or the subordinated rules, diminishing the independence and effectiveness of the Court. Moreover, the Union has applied very strong pressure on its members to present a united front on this issue.\nGiven this background, it is hardly surprising that an increasing number of African states have had the courage of their convictions and flouted their obligations in relation to the ICC.\nThe ICC has attempted to counter this development by creating a compliance mechanism.\nIt has chided Chad, Malawi, DR Congo and Nigeria for non-compliance with the obligation to co-operate, and occasionally even referred the issue to the UN Security Council. But the clear violations of international obligations have not been pursued very seriously.\nAll this reveals a bleak picture for the future.\nThe ICC was meant to realise the vision for a universal body that would help deter the worst abuses of human beings by other human beings, wherever they may occur, and establish accountability for such abuses.\nThis universal aspiration is now falling prey to a reassertion of old notions of national sovereignty, at least in Africa.\nMarc Weller is professor of International Law and International Constitutional Studies at the University of Cambridge and Director of the Lauterpacht Centre for International Law.", "About 700 rebels and their families, a total of nearly 3,000 people, were evacuated on buses from al-Wair district, government officials say.\n\"The city of Homs is completely clear of weapons and militants,\" provincial governor Talal Barazi said.\nMany fighters were going to the rebel-held Idlib province, in the north-west.\nSome were heading to Jarablus, an area in northern Syria controlled by rebels backed by Turkey.\nMost of the rebels had been driven out of Homs in 2014, after years under siege by government forces.\nA Russia-brokered evacuation deal was agreed earlier this year.\nUnder the agreement, opposition fighters are granted safe passage with their weapons out of Homs to rebel-held areas in Syria.\nThe Syrian government says such \"reconciliation\" deals, which have been agreed in several rebel-held areas, are key to ending the six-year civil war.\nOpposition fighters say that they have been coerced into such agreements by brutal sieges and bombardments.\nHoms became a key battleground of the Syrian uprising after residents embraced the call to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad in 2011 and drove security forces out of much of the city the following year.\nThat prompted the government to begin a two-year siege that left whole areas destroyed and eventually forced the rebels to withdraw from the Old City to al-Wair.\nMore than 300,000 people have been killed across Syria since 2011.", "Media playback is not supported on this device\nPanthers secured their sixth Challenge Cup success in the past seven seasons thanks to Evan Mosey's overtime winner.\nNeilson told BBC Radio Nottingham: \"The guys played with commitment and honour.\n\"Honour is a word I have been using for a while.

basis, a review of 39 studies found.\nThis remained true in those who already showed signs of cognitive decline.\nTaking up exercise at any age was worthwhile for the mind and body, the Australian researchers said.\nExercises such as T'ai Chi were recommended for people over the age of 50 who couldn't manage other more challenging forms of exercise, the study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine said.\nPhysical activity has long been known to reduce the risk of a number of diseases, including type-2 diabetes and some cancers, and it is thought to play a role in warding off the brain's natural decline as we enter middle age.\nThe theory is that through exercise the brain receives a greater supply of blood, oxygen and nutrients that boost its health as well as a growth hormone that helps the formation of new neurons and connections.\nIn this analysis of previous studies, researchers from the University of Canberra looked at the effects of at least four weeks of structured physical exercise on the brain function of adults.\nIn a variety of brain tests, they found evidence of aerobic exercise improving cognitive abilities, such as thinking, reading, learning and reasoning, while muscle training - for example, using weights - had a significant effect on memory and the brain's ability to plan and organise, the so-called executive functions.\nJoe Northey, study author and researcher from the Research Institute for Sport and Exercise at Canberra, said the findings were convincing enough to enable both types of exercise to be prescribed to improve brain health in the over-50s.\n\"Even if you are doing moderate exercise only once or twice a week there are still improvements in cognitive function, but the improvements were better the more exercise was done,\" he said.\nHe said people should be able to hold a conversation while doing moderate exercise.\nNHS guidelines recommend that adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity every week and exercise the major muscles on two or more days a week.\nDr Justin Varney, lead for adult health and wellbeing at Public Health England, said any physical activity was good for brain and body.\n\"Whilst every 10 minutes of exercise provides some benefit, doing 150 minutes a week cuts the chances of depression and dementia by a third, and boosts mental health at any age.\n\"Doing both aerobic and strengthening exercises leads to a greater variety of health benefits.\"\nFind out how to get into just about any sport (and fitness routines) with the BBC Get Inspired special guides\nHe said cycling or walking to work could count as aerobic activity and carrying heavy shopping bags was one example of a good strength exercise.\nDr Dean Burnett, lecturer in neuroscience and psychiatry at Cardiff University, said the study gave a clearer picture of how exercise affected the brain - but there were still issues.\n\"It could lead to increased pressure for the 50-plus age group to exercise more in order to stay mentally healthy, which is good advice but also overlooks the fact that as we age it's increasingly difficult to engage in physical activity, as our bodies are simply less capable of it,\" he said.\n\"Physical exercise is one element of improved brain functioning, but not the whole story.\"\nAs well as staying physically active, Dr David Reynolds, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said it was equally important to look after our brains by staying mentally active, eating a balanced diet, drinking only in moderation and not smoking.\nGet news from the BBC in your

Garbutt, the NFU's chief livestock adviser, said.\nBut Thanet District Council, which imposed the ban, said construction work was needed before any resumption.\n\"The health and welfare of the animals through transit is the top priority of farmers.\"\nThanet District Council suspended live exports through the Port of Ramsgate on 20 September and live animals were sent abroad from the Port of Ipswich.\nMr Garbutt said anyone transporting animals had a duty to use the shortest route to reach their destination.\n\"We have made it clear that the port of Dover would be the most suitable location, but as the boat being used is unable to dock there currently, Ramsgate is the next best option available,\" he explained.\nThanet council said that live exports had been \"suspended until further notice\" and its lifting would depend on the construction of \"suitable facilities\" at the port.\nLive animal exports have been suspended from the Port of Ipswich, a week after sheep were sent overseas.\nRSPCA chief executive Gavin Grant said: \"ABP [Associated British Ports] have acknowledged to the RSPCA that, like Ramsgate, their port did not have suitable facilities to help the animals should an emergency arise.\"\nThe 43 sheep that were destroyed were examined by vets who found that one had a broken leg, another was so sick it had to be put down, and 41 were severely lame.\nNone of the animals could reach their drinkers in the vehicle, the RSPCA said.\nSix sheep fell in the water while being taken off the lorry, and four were rescued by RSPCA officers, but two

slightly more than $8bn (\u00c2\u00a36.1bn).\nApple's flagship iPhone is losing market share to a slew of local competitors.\nThe company also faces challenges in dealing with China's strict internet censorship regime.\nChina is important for Apple because it makes much of its hardware there, and it's a major market for its products too.\nGlobally, the company posted quarterly revenue of $45.4bn (\u00c2\u00a334.4bn), fuelled by the sale of 41 million iPhones.\nBut research firm IDC said that iPhone shipments in China fell 27% year on year in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe problem, it seems, is that local competitors like Oppo, Huawei and Xiaomi are cheaper, and their products have improved dramatically.\nAlthough the iPhone had the edge a few years ago, competitors like Huawei's P10 now represent a comparable product, according to Jake Saunders, an analyst with technology market intelligence company ABI Research.\n\"You can buy a clone type phone for a price tag that's essentially about half as much,\" he said.\nApple may now look to apps and services to bolster revenues from the mainland, and this could bring it into conflict with China's tightening censorship regime.\nLast month, Apple pulled more than 60 virtual private network (VPN) apps from its App Store in China, because of regulations that required all VPNs to licensed.\nVPNs allow users to skirt around China's censorship filters and gain access to websites and services that are restricted or banned there.\nDuring an earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook defended the decision, and said approved VPN apps were still available.\n\"We would rather not remove the apps, but like in other countries, we obey the laws where we do business,\" he said.\nWe are hopeful that over time, the restrictions we are seeing are loosened, because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate, and I know that is a major focus there.\"\nIn July, Apple established its first data centre in China, in

about the financial savings from Brexit had to be managed, he said.\nMeanwhile Boris Johnson has insisted defence and security co-operation would continue despite the UK's exit.\nAhead of a meeting of European foreign ministers in Slovakia, the foreign secretary said \"we may be leaving the EU, but we are not leaving Europe,\" adding that the government is \"absolutely committed to participation in European foreign policy, defence and security cooperation\".\nSpeaking during a visit to Austria earlier, Mr Johnson said the UK was seeking a \"new European partnership\" with the EU's remaining 27 members\nMr Tyrie, the chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, backed Remain in June's poll which resulted in a Leave victory.\nHe is now urging ministers to \"cast aside the damaging claim and counter-claim\" of the referendum period.\nIn a pamphlet written for the Open Europe think tank, Mr Tyrie said the referendum's \"pernicious legacy\" was to add to a \"deep distrust in politics\".\n\"Politicians cannot afford to allow this to get any worse,\" he said, saying the government had to be frank about the \"trade-offs\" involved with Brexit - \"and the fact that many of the promises made by the Leave side are manifestly unfulfillable\".\nHe added: \"Equally unfulfillable are the hopes of many Remainers, that the UK can carry on pretty much as now, and that a renegotiation can achieve continued membership through the back door.\"\nParliament should get the opportunity to approve the UK's negotiating position before Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - which begins a two-year exit process - is triggered, Mr Tyrie said.\nPrime Minister Theresa May has rejected this option.\nMrs May has said she will not trigger Article 50 until the start of next year at the earliest, while some Brexit campaigners have called for it to be done immediately.\nAccording to Mr Tyrie, the government should wait for \"clarity\" from other EU partners on what they will be able to offer, which could mean delaying Article 50 until German elections in September 2017.\nMr Tyrie, who based his article on evidence given to his Commons committee, said the negotiations over Brexit could secure \"meaningful economic and political gains\" but risked \"early and possibly severe damage\" if not approached properly.\nHe said Britain should aim to negotiate \"extensive access to the single market, some degree of influence over its rules, withdrawal from the customs union, and the restoration of control over free movement\", entrenched in a treaty with the EU.\nAlongside access to the EU's markets, Mr Tyrie also said \"far-reaching\" change was needed to the free movement of people. Curbs to migration have been the key demand of many Brexit campaigners.\nEU leaders have stressed that single market access is dependent on accepting free movement.\nBut Mr Tyrie said: \"The idea that ultimate UK control over migration can be restored without fatally compromising the UK's trade relationship with the EU is not unreasonable.\n\"Purism by EU negotiators on this point would not only be inconsistent with reality; it would also clash with other member states' economic interests.\"\nThe government needs to be clear that curbing immigration could carry an economic cost for the UK, \"controversial though saying this remains\", he added.\nIn other Brexit news, a new campaign group is being launched to succeed the Britain Stronger in Europe group, which led the unsuccessful Remain campaign.\nThe cross-party Open Britain group said it would push for continued membership of the single market while making a positive case about the benefits of immigration - \"mending not ending\" the free movement of EU citizens into the UK.\nThe organisation says it has the backing of 500,000 registered supporters across the UK and the endorsement of senior Conservatives, Labour and Lib Dem politicians.\n\"Getting the best deal for Britain means starting the negotiations with ambitious goals,\" said Tory MP and ex-business minister Anna Soubry, one of the group's spokespeople.\n\"The campaign will marry a commitment to Britain's membership of the single market with making a positive case about the benefits of immigration.\n\"The present system needs further reform. It's particularly important people know the facts about immigration, we tackle their concerns and ensure the system works fairly for everyone.\"", "A general election gives adults in the UK the chance to have a say on who runs the country.\nThey do this by voting for an MP to represent them and be their voice in Parliament (in the picture above).\nYou can find out more about how MPs get their jobs - and how a general election works - here.\nBut to find out more about what MPs do once they've got the job, read on below.\nMP stands for Member of Parliament. He or she is a person who represents a particular area of the country in parliament.\nThe UK is divided into 650 of these areas, called constituencies - and there is an MP for each one. So that makes 650 MPs in Parliament in total.\nThey meet together in the House of Commons, which is part of the Houses of Parliament in London.\nMPs split their time between working in Parliament and working in their constituency.\nWhen they are working in Parliament, they can suggest and consider new laws, and take part in important votes on how the country is run.\nMost MPs belong to groups called political parties - for example, the Conservative Party or the Labour Party\nThey can also bring up issues that matter to people in their constituency with important members of the government.\nThey might do this by asking a question to a politician on one person's behalf or they might bring up a topic in the House of Commons that is important to people who live in their constituency.\nSometimes, if the members of their constituency want something different to what their own political party wants, MPs may have to choose between upsetting their constituents or upsetting their party!\nSome MPs who belong to the party (or parties) in power at the time will be given special jobs in the government, on top of their role as an MP.\nThey will be made government ministers and asked to look after particular areas of how the country is run - for example, health or education.\nWhen MPs are working in their constituency, they will often hold special meetings called surgeries, at which members of the public can go to meet them if they have something they want to talk to their local MP about.\nThey will go along to public events, and visit local schools and businesses, so they can better understand what matters most to the people they represent. It also helps local people to get to know their MP.\nCurrently, if MPs want to have another paid job on top of their job as an MP, they can, but they have to officially register it.\nSome people think it is a good thing if MPs have another job too, as it keeps them in touch with members of the public, and means they have more skills and knowledge to bring to their job in Parliament.\nOthers think that MPs shouldn't be allowed to have another job, as they should be fully committed to their job in Parliament and should focus all of their time on this.\nThere is a report currently being put together about what should be allowed with MPs having second jobs. The results will be presented in June.\nWhen MPs come together in the House of Commons, they will debate and vote on issues that are important to the country.\nThis might be to do with rules in schools or how much money your parents have to spend on things, so these things can affect you.\nCurrently, there aren't any MPs as Parliament has been \"dissolved\" ahead of the election. Click on the link to find out more about what this means, but it's a bit like the end of term has happened.\nAll over the UK, the people who want to be MPs - called candidates - are currently working very hard to convince people to vote for them on 8 June.\nWhile you cannot vote yet, when you turn 18, you will be able to vote in the general election to choose who you want to be your MP.", "But Alexis Tsipras's latest missive to Jean Claude Juncker, Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde, to secure financial succour from Greece's creditors, makes that pledge - along with promises to liberalise assorted legal jobs and drinks, petroleum and food markets.\nThe big point, however, is that Greece's Syriza government has more-or-less caved in to almost all the demands from the Eurogroup and IMF for VAT rises and pension cuts. These issues of absolute principle for Syriza appear to be have become pragmatic bargaining chips.\nWhich has put eurozone finance ministers on the spot. Can they really refuse to go back to the negotiating table with Mr Tsipras and his colleagues in a serious way, almost immediately?\nAs for the timing of the leaking of Mr Tsipras's letter, to the FT, well it could have an important impact on the potentially incendiary deliberations of the European Central Bank (ECB).\nThe ECB will announce later today whether to demand more collateral from Greek banks for the \u20ac120bn odd of Emergency Liquidity Assistance it and the Bank of Greece have provided to Greek banks.\nAs you will recall, the ECB's decision on Sunday not to provide any additional credit to Greek banks forced those banks to close their doors, freeze transfers abroad and limit cash withdrawals from ATMs to \u20ac60.\nIf, however, it were to insist banks hand over more assets as protection against potential losses on the outstanding central bank credit, well sources tell me that one or possibly two of the banks would be in dire straits - because they don't have much unencumbered collateral left, and nor do they have cash to repay any of their debts to the ECB and Bank of Greece.\nIn other words, demanding more collateral could totally sink a Greek bank: it would no longer be frozen; it would be kaput.\nWhich is why I would be mildly surprised if the ECB were to take this dramatic step at this delicate juncture, with the Greek government so close to complete capitulation to Eurogroup and IMF demands - because to do so could actually have the perverse consequence of so exacerbating Greece's banking crisis, that the ECB's potential losses on its exposure to the country could increase.\nThat said, if Sunday's referendum were to go ahead - which no longer seems as certain as it did, after Mr Tsipras's latest epistle - and if the Greeks were to vote no to the bailout, at that point the ECB would almost certainly demand more collateral, and more-or-less totally muller the banks.\nWhich is - perhaps - reason enough to assume that Mr Tsipras and co may be regretting their plebiscite call.\nIt explains, arguably, why he is seemingly moving heaven and earth, with his new offers to creditors, to make the referendum otiose - although it is very difficult to see how he can cancel it unless the Eurogroup says that pensions and VAT concessions are a basis for a deal.\nWe're a long way from the end of this amazing Greek drama.", "Freeza Meats Ltd was also fined \u00a322,500 for fraudulently selling burgers to which beef hearts had been added.\nThe company, which no longer trades, was at the centre of a horsemeat scandal in 2013.\nThe former director of the company later said his firm did nothing wrong.\nA court heard that an investigation by Newry and Mourne District Council (NMDC) exposed the fraud.\nFreeza Meats was originally charged with 71 offences, involving failure to comply with EC food regulations.\nThe Newry court heard that Freeza Meats had bought almost 655,000 tonnes of beef hearts to use in their supermarket products.\nLabels on burger products did not identify the beef hearts as a separate ingredient.

He batted much better today, but his place is still in jeopardy.\"\nBell, 33, has now gone 21 innings without scoring a century, during which time he averages 20.\nThe manner of his dismissal, caught behind via glove as he padded up to Babar, led to renewed calls for England to end his 117-Test career before the final Test in Sharjah.\n\"It might just save his place but I'm not sure it's the right way to go,\" said Boycott.\nEx-England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Radio 5 live: \"In a three-match series I really do think the best thing for Ian Bell and the team is for him to play in Sharjah.\n\"He is averaging over 40 for the series.

He has scored only 48 runs in four innings since being promoted to the top of the order.\nBut of greater concern for England was the back injury which hampered captain Alastair Cook in the field and reduced him to hobbling between the wickets during his innings of 10.\n\"Alastair is fine; he's not the greatest mover,\" said Farbrace.\n\"I don't think he's injured. It's to do with the amount of hours he's spent bent over a bat handle scoring thousands of runs.\"\nWhen Cook swept Yasir to Riaz at deep backward square-leg, England were 19-2 and in danger of reprising their first-innings collapse.\nRoot, composed as ever, and an increasingly confident Bell repelled Pakistan for almost 35 overs, but Babar found enough turn and bounce from the footholes to end their alliance 10 overs before the close.\nBairstow helped Root avoid any further mishap, but the gaggle of close catchers who surrounded them for the remainder of the day was a sneak preview of what England can expect on Monday.\nApparently not.

But she would not offer any explanation as to why this may be the case.\nShe said: \"The study presents a robust and independent set of findings to inform discussion and debate, and to stimulate action. Further work - by Hefce, by the sector and by government - will be needed to understand why these effects are happening, and what sorts of interventions will be most effective in bringing about positive change.\"\nBut Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said: \"Dividing the school population into 'state' and 'private' is too crude to yield anything of value.\n\"The majority of our pupils' A-levels were graded A  or A* last summer and we note that Hefce, despite their best efforts, are unable to show that our pupils did less well at university than other groups.\"\nDr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of high-performing universities, said: \"As the report reiterates, A-level and equivalent qualifications are still, without doubt, the key source of information about academic ability.\n\"Students with better A-levels do better in higher education. But Russell Group universities take a range of factors into account when deciding which students are offered a place.\n\"So the candidate's qualifications are considered in a broader 'context'. The bottom line is we want to give places to the pupils with the qualifications, potential and determination to succeed.\"\nThe study also found that students from disadvantaged areas tended to do less well than those from more advantaged areas - even though they had achieved the same A-level grades.\nProf Les Ebdon, director of fair access to higher education, said: \"This important research shows that a student's background influences their likely degree outcome.\n\"This is a worrying finding, suggesting that disadvantage continues to follow disadvantaged young people, even after they have overcome often significant barriers to get into university.\"", "Offaly held an early lead but Cavan finished the first half strongly to go in 0-11 to 0-9 ahead at the break.\nCavan won the game

It is due to expire in 2018.\nAccording to figures from the Office for Rail Regulation, last year ATW received the highest public subsidy per passenger mile of any franchise across the UK.\nMr Jones said: \"What was obvious is that this wasn't a contract that recognised the substantial increase in train passengers that there's been since 2003.\n\"It was predicated on the basis that it would grow far more slowly than it has, so you have the examples of many trains, particularly the Valley Lines services, where you had severe overcrowding and you hadn't got more services available.\"\nHe added: \"Because the franchise was written in the way it was, Arriva was under no obligation to provide extra services, and because we felt that it was necessary to meet some of the demand, we had to pay for that under our own revenue, so we were paying over and above the franchise money simply to order to deal with capacity issues.\n\"The original contract was flawed because it didn't anticipate the increase in passenger numbers.\"\nThe former minister now wants to see major changes, including a \"not for dividend\" model for the franchise after 2018, where profits would be re-invested in the service, rather than being paid to shareholders.\nTransport expert Prof Stuart Cole, from the University of Glamorgan, said the model could deliver real improvements for Welsh travellers.\n\"It has the potential to keep the profits that are made on the business, and any other surpluses within Wales and within the railway franchise,\" he said.\n\"It's fair to say that any of the train operating companies have to make profits for their shareholders.\n\"The particular problem we had with the Welsh franchise was that it was designed for a low level of demand, and that low level of demand has not, in fact, continued - it has grown substantially.\n\"The Welsh government had to acquire more trains, through Arriva, and all that builds up the cost.\"\nATW said that while the original franchise let by the then strategic rail authority made little provision for investment, it had invested more than \u00a330m in improving passenger facilities at stations and on trains.\nA spokesman said: \"We have also increased the number of services running in Wales where possible in areas of high passenger demand in response to growing passenger numbers.\n\"Many of these changes have been provided over and above Arriva Trains Wales' commitments in its franchise and at no additional cost to tax payers.\"\nHe added: \"Since taking over the franchise, customer satisfaction and performance remain high and passenger numbers continue to grow. Arriva Trains Wales remains in discussions with the Department for Transport and Welsh government, who have also invested significantly, regarding future service provision and accommodating further passenger growth.\"\nA Welsh government spokesman said: \"The Welsh government will lead on the process to relet the Wales and Borders rail franchise from its expiry in 2018, and we are in the early stages of preparing for this.\n\"We are committed to exploring the option of the next franchise being operated on a not-for-dividend basis.\n\"As part of this officials are considering how better value for money could be achieved.\"\nHe said the work was linked to other projects, particularly the electrification of the Cardiff Valley Lines network.

And given that, I don't understand why he wasn't prosecuted.\"\nHenry Clarke first came to the attention of police in 1982 when an investigation began into systematic abuse at the notorious Kincora boys' home in Belfast.\nSome of the teenagers who had been abused at Kincora had come from Bawnmore, where they said they had also been sexually assaulted.\nBelfast man Billy Brown, 61, was abused by Clarke at Bawnmore care home in Newtownabbey in 1968.\nMr Brown was just 12 years old and in care when Henry Clarke invited him to his family home, introduced him to his parents and then abused him while he slept.\nHe said Henry Clarke should be brought to justice no matter how long ago the abuse happened.\n\"The legal system let me down,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"He should be brought to justice now. He should have faced the courts like everyone else. If I do something wrong I face the courts.\n\"At the end of the day, why should he not face the courts? I can't understand it. What was the reason they let him go?\"\nIn 1985, Clarke admitted abusing two boys when taken in for questioning by police during a family holiday in Northern Ireland.\nIn a statement to police, he admitted to sexual touching a child. The indecent assault happened in 1968 - 17 years before his confession.\nIn spite of his admission, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) ordered \"no prosecution\".\nAsked why, the current Public Prosecution Service said that the DPP at the time considered the abuse had happened too long ago.\n\"The directing officer considered that given the time period which had elapsed (17 years) it would be inappropriate to pursue a prosecution,\" said a PPS spokesperson.\n\"The prosecutor in this case was following the applicable guidance at the time in the then DPPs' Office.\"\nBut leading Barrister Eugene Grant QC said the passage of time did not matter in this case.\n\"On any reading, the DPP decision not to prosecute here is devoid of any rationale or indeed any legal principle,\" he said.\n\"Simply to say a 17-year delay exists without more does not actually hold weight from a legal perspective.\"\nAccording to evidence given at the Historical Institutional Abuse inquiry, the DPP directed: \"It was considered that the passage of time rendered proceedings stale and inappropriate.\nBilly Brown said this reason did not make sense because two other child abusers who had sexually assaulted him in the late 60s had been tried and sentenced in the 1980s.\n\"The other ones, they went to jail, they done their bird,\" he said. \"But he gets away.\"\nAfter Henry Clarke returned to Canada in 1985, he wrote a letter to police in Belfast, confessing to another case of sexual abuse - this time against a resident from the Conway House children's home who was assaulted at a Boys Brigade camp in Newcastle, County Down.\n\"I wrote a letter to them and told them that I had missed telling them about this other boy and I felt at that point in time there would be consequences for my admission,\" he said.\nBut there were no consequences.\nGiven the state prosecutor's previous refusal to mount a case against Clarke, this time police did not even tell the DPP about this latest confession; the RUC said there should be \"no further action\".\nA senior police officer wrote: \"As the act admitted by Clarke is not punishable in law, there is no necessity to forward papers to the DPP.\"\nBut according to the PPS, the sexual touching of a child was, in fact, punishable in law at the time.\nBarrister Mr Grant, who examined the papers in the case, said the act carried out on the boy was a crime and questioned the police's reason for not referring the case for prosecution.\n\"We have in the documentation a statement by a very senior RUC detective, who oversees the investigation, making it quite clear that, in his view, this is not an offence punishable by law,\" he said.\n\"That is quite clearly wrong and it does not make any sense, so in my view, the RUC decision not to send this file to the DPP fails.\"\nQuestions have also been raised over why the RUC did not alert the authorities in Canada to Henry Clarke's confessions of abuse.\nIn his letter to the RUC in 1985, he looked for an indication from the police as to whether they intended contacting the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\nA senior policeman from Northern Ireland concluded: \"As Clarke has not been convicted of any offence, there is no obligation to notify the RCMP.\"\nThe PSNI said it was now reviewing how it shares information with the Canadian police.\nCh Supt George Clarke, head of the PSNI's Public Protection Branch, said: \"It is noted that when the decision was taken not to inform RCMP, that was on the basis that Clarke had not been convicted of any offence, which may have been the relevant standard or requirement applicable then.\"\nSince no one in Canada was made aware of Henry Clarke's admissions, he continued to live out his life without anyone in authority knowing about his confessions.\nHe pastored at four different churches before retiring.\nMr Gamble said it was a mistake that Canadian officials were not notified.\n\"I am not surprised that historically the police would have taken the position that in the absence of a conviction they wouldn't feel comfortable with sharing information,\" he said.\n\"I think that's an error of judgement.\n\"I don't know how many of us would have shared the information back then.\n\"The level of understanding and maturity around this was very low.

Some spin-off shows have been hugely successful - but there have also been quite a few flops.\nHere's a round-up of some of the best and worst:\nCheers and Frasier\nFrasier is one of television's most successful spin-offs.\nIt lasted for 11 seasons and notched up 264 episodes - just behind its predecessor Cheers, which managed 270.\nThe Kelsey Grammer sitcom continued the story of radio psychiatrist Frasier Crane. Digital Spy's TV editor Morgan Jeffery thinks the change in tone contributed to its success.\n\"Frasier had a different style and sense of humour to Cheers,\" he says. \"A spin-off needs to look and feel different. A lot of bad spin-offs are just watered down versions of the original.\"\nThe change certainly worked wonders for Frasier - the sitcom broke an Emmy Awards record, winning 37 over the course of its run (although the record was later beaten by the pesky Game of Thrones).\nBreaking Bad and Better Call Saul\nWhile Breaking Bad centred on characters played by Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, corrupt lawyer Saul Goodman (played by Bob Odenkirk) developed something of a cult following.\nBetter Call Saul, which began in 2015, was created by Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, the brains behind Breaking Bad.\nThe Times's TV critic Andrew Billen thinks focusing on a less prominent character can often make a spin-off more likely to succeed.\n\"Most shows are not Marvel Comic universes, they're built around one or two heroes,\" he says. \"But if you take a minor character, there's more chance of succeeding. Then you're into something much nearer to a Hollywood franchise.\"\nJeffery agrees: \"Angel is a good example of a character who maybe wasn't getting the screen time when he was on Buffy The Vampire Slayer, so he was given a show where there was more space to explore that character.\"\nHappy Days and its seven spin-offs\nHappy Days certainly knows a thing or two about spin-offs - it had seven. Seven!\nThe most successful were Mork & Mindy, which starred Robin Williams; and Laverne & Shirley, which was fronted by Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams.\nThe latter, which first aired in 1976, focused on two single room-mates (who had been friends of Fonzie's in the main show) who work as bottlecappers in a Milwaukee brewery.\nIt ran side-by-side with Happy Days, and by its third season had become the most popular TV show in the US.\nThe show was cancelled in 1983, but it still managed an impressive eight seasons.\nFriends and Joey\nAs one of the most successful sitcoms in television history, Friends was ripe for spin-off when it ended in 2004.\nOnly Matt LeBlanc stuck with the character that made him famous, and Joey was launched that September.\nBut it didn't go down well with fans, and viewing figures were low. It was cancelled after two seasons, with the final eight episodes not even making it to air.\n\"Matt LeBlanc was fantastic in [Friends] but he was playing a caricature,\" Billen says. \"I'm not sure there was enough complexity to Joey as a character, he was more of a clown, and it's difficult to build a show around that premise.\"\nJeffery adds: \"I don't feel there was a clear creative vision behind Joey, they just wanted to keep the Friends train going for a few more years.\"\nThe Mary Tyler Moore Show and its three spin-offs\nWhen it comes to spin-offs, Billen describes The Mary Tyler Moore Show as \"the mother of them all\".\nHe explains: \"It was so successful, the best friend Rhoda, played by Valerie Harper, got a spin-off. And the neighbour and landlady Phyllis also span off, but the really significant one was Lou Grant.\n\"In the original show, Mary Tyler Moore's character worked in a TV station in the newsroom, and the news editor [Grant] then span off into a drama series. It ran many seasons, and was a post-Watergate view of investigative journalism.\"\nIncluding the original, that totals an impressive four shows in the Tyler Moore universe.\nOnly Fools and Horses and Green Green Grass\nAsk a British sitcom fan what their favourite shows of all time are, and it's likely Only Fools and Horses will figure highly on their list.\nIt's slightly less likely they'd choose The Green Green Grass, the Fools spin-off that began in 2005 and focused on Boycie and his wife Marlene\nIt managed 32 episodes but was cancelled in 2009 after continuing negative reviews from critics.\nThe world of CSI\nCSI: Crime Scene Investigation began in September 2002 and was hugely popular with audiences.\nSo popular, in fact, that it sparked CSI: Miami, CSI: NY and the more recent (and less successful) CSI: Cyber.\nJeffery says the CSIs \"work on a business level because you're giving people more of what they enjoyed before\".\nCSI: Skegness surely only a matter of time.\nThe Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon?\nJeffrey thinks it could be just the right time for The Big Bang Theory to get the spin-off treatment.\n\"I believe it's close to being renewed again but it doesn't feel like it's got too much life left in it,\" he says. \"It's probably got a couple more seasons before the cast try and shoehorn themselves out of the show.\"\nThe Guardian's Stuart Heritage put it slightly more bluntly, writing that the announcement of Young Sheldon means \"The Big Bang Theory has officially started its death spiral\".\nBig Bang may well be ripe for a spin-off, but its makers will have to tread carefully.\n\"There's absolutely no guarantee a spin-off will work better than any brand new comedy or a brand new programme,\" cautions Billen.\n\"It will give you ratings for the first couple of episodes, and after that it sinks or swims on its own merit.\"\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Authorities allowed about 100 of them inside.\nThe court dismissed the case a few hours after the hearing started.\nThe entire case was argued and decided within a few short hours, and the judge was quick to reject China's first legal argument in favour of gay marriage. But many gay rights activists see reason for hope.\nThe fact the case was heard at all was reason for optimism - the plaintiffs and their lawyer were surprised when the Hunan court agreed to hold a hearing in January. The hearing itself was held in an unusually large courtroom, with uncharacteristically light security outside.\nFew believe the Chinese courts are poised to issue dramatic decisions permitting same-sex marriage. But bit by bit, some cases are being won. In December 2014, a Beijing court awarded damages to a man who had suffered electric shock therapy meant to \"cure\" his homosexuality. Advertisements for the service were ordered to be removed from the internet.\nThe demand for gay rights is certainly part of the national conversation now in China.

We are following developments in North Korea closely and consulting with our allies and partners in the region,\" it said in a statement.\nChina, North Korea's main economic backer, said the execution was an \"internal matter\" for North Korea.\nHowever, the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing says the bland statement is likely to mask deep concern and will raise questions as to how much influence China actually has over the nuclear-armed state.\nMr Chang - married to the elder Kim's sister - had held senior posts in the ruling party and was vice-chairman of the powerful National Defence Commission, the North's top military body.\nHe was frequently pictured alongside his nephew and seen by some observers as the power behind the throne.\nBut in early December, it emerged that he had been removed from his senior military position and that two of his aides had been executed.\nThen on Monday, KCNA broadcast footage of him being removed from a party session by uniformed guards.\nIn a long report on Friday, KCNA said: \"Chang dreamed such a foolish dream that once he seizes power by a base method, his despicable true colours as 'reformist' known to the outside world would help his 'new government' get 'recognised' by foreign countries in a short span of time.\"\nIt also said Mr Chang:\nUnder questioning Mr Chang is alleged to have confessed: \"I was going to stage the coup by using high-ranking army officers who had close ties with me or by mobilising armed forces under the control of my confidantes.\nBy Lucy WilliamsonBBC News, Seoul\nThis purge is striking for its speed and publicity. The crimes Chang Song-thaek was accused of - disloyalty and insurrection - are the most serious North Korea can muster.\nHis proximity to power and his positions of responsibility had, state media said, led him to see himself as equal to the country's young leader, and seek to topple him.\nChang Song-thaek had a lot of power over economic decisions, and regularly handled relations with China.  Some believe that Chang's admiration for China's growth model led to policy differences within the regime.\nBut others say this is a battle for control of the North Korean state; that its young leader, Kim Jong-un, had outgrown his uncle's protection, and saw him instead as a rival and potential threat.\nChang Song-thaek has already been edited out of official documentaries: his story rewritten by the country's powerful propaganda machine. His dramatic fall from grace, designed to hammer the message home: that no one - not family members, not North Korea's most senior figures - is beyond retribution.\nBut the worry remains: how much does this story reveal about instability at the heart of the North Korean regime?\n\"I didn't fix the definite time for the coup. But it was my intention to concentrate my department and all economic organs on the cabinet and become premier when the economy goes totally bankrupt and the state is on the verge of collapse.\"\nThere was no immediate word about the whereabouts of Mr Chang's wife, Kim Kyung Hee.\nAnalysts say Mr Chang's fall from grace could be seen as the latest in a series of carefully calibrated moves to demonstrate Kim Jong-un's authority and an assertion of his independence.\nIn August 2012, Mr Chang made a high profile trip to China, where he met then-President Hu Jintao. The two sides later signed a raft of economic deals, including the development of two special economic zones: Rason, on North Korea's east coast, and Hwanggumphyong, on the border with China.\nThe BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says one theory about Mr Chang's demise is that his work with China had led him to admire some of Beijing's economic reforms.\nBut it is more likely that he presented a perceived threat to his nephew's authority, she says.\nProfessor Lee Jung-hoon, from South Korea's Yonsei University, told the BBC that the move showed that North Korea was \"very unstable\".\n\"[For Kim Jong-un] to go to the extent to actually purge him and execute him says a lot about the state of things in that country,\" he said.\nAs news of the purge emerged earlier this week, South Korean President Park Geun-hye warned the North was \"carrying out a reign of terror\" to reinforce Mr Kim's position.\nOn Friday, South Korea's military said it had tightened surveillance on Pyongyang, news agency Yonhap reported.\nMeanwhile, Japan's top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said: \"We will calmly monitor the situation while communicating with other countries and collect relevant information.\"\nKim Jong-il (d)\nKim Kyung-hee\nChang Song-thaek (d)\nKim Jong-nam\nKim Sul-song\nKim Jong-chul\nKim Jong-un\nRi Sol-ju\nKim Han-sol\nKim Jong-il was one of the most secretive leaders in the world.Tales from dissidents and past aides created an image of an irrational, power-hungry man who allowed his people to starve while he enjoyed dancing girls and cognac.\nBut a different picture was painted by Sung Hae-rim, the sister of one of his former partners in her memoir, The Wisteria House.\nShe describes a devoted father and a sensitive, charismatic individual, although she admits even those closest to him were fearful of him.\nNorth Korean media depicted him as a national hero, whose birth to the country's founder, Kim Il-sung, was marked by a double rainbow and a bright star.\nThe youngest sister of the late Kim Jong-il and the wife of the man formerly regarded as the second most powerful figure in North Korea, Chang Song-thaek.\nShe has held a wide range of important Workers' Party positions including being a member of the all-powerful Central Committee.\nHer promotion to four-star general made Kim Kyung-hee the first North Korean woman ever to achieve such status.\nAnalysts say Kim Kyung-hee and her husband were seen as mentors for the new leader Kim Jong-un when he came to power in 2011. But news of her husband's execution in December 2013 suggests the most significant upheaval in North Korea's leadership since Mr Kim succeeded his father.\nChang Song-thaek was married to Kim Kyung-hee, the younger sister of the late Kim Jong-il. When the inexperienced Kim Jong-un became the new leader in 2011, the couple were widely thought to be acting as his mentors.\nIn December 2013, the powerful uncle - who sat on the country's top military body - was denounced by the state-run news agency for corruption. Images were shown of him being removed from a Politburo meeting by uniformed guards. He was then executed.\nMr Chang's execution is the biggest upheaval in North Korea's leadership since Mr Kim succeeded his father.\nKim Jong-nam, 39, is Kim Jong-il's eldest son.\nSung Hae-rang, the sister of Kim Jong-nam's deceased mother Sung Hae-rim, has written in her memoir that Kim Jong-il was extremely fond of Kim Jong-nam and was pained to be away from him. Like his half-brothers, Kim Jong-nam studied at an international school in Switzerland.\nHis chances of succession appeared to be ruined when, in 2001, Japanese officials caught him trying to sneak into Japan using a false passport. He told officials that he was planning to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\nSome analysts argued that he may have been forgiven by his father, as there is precedent for the regime reinstating disgraced figures after a period of atonement. Confucian tradition also favours the oldest son.\nBut in a rare interview while on a trip to China last year, Kim Jong-nam said he had \"no interest\" in succeeding his father.\nKim Sul-song, 36, is Kim Jong-il's daughter born to his first wife, Kim Young-sook.\nReports say she has worked in the country's propaganda department, with responsibility for literary affairs.\nOne South Korean report said she had also served as her father's secretary.\nKim Jong-chul, 29, studied at an international school in Switzerland. He works in the WKP propaganda department.\nHis mother, Ko Yong-hui, is said to have been the North Korean leader's favourite consort.\nHowever, Kenji Fujimoto, the pseudonym of a Japanese sushi chef who spent 13 years cooking for Kim Jong-il, has written that the leader considered his second son \"no good because he is like a little girl\".\nKim Jong-un, the second son of Kim Jong-il and his late wife Ko Yong-hui, was anointed \"the great successor\" by Pyongyang.\nLike his older brothers, he is thought to have been educated abroad.\nA Japanese sushi chef who worked for Kim Jong-il for 13 years up to 2001 said that he \"resembled his father in every way, including his physical frame\".\nSpeculation that he was being groomed to succeed his father had been rife for years.\nSince taking power, he has presided over a long-range missile test, North Korea's third nuclear test and most recently the execution of his uncle, Chang Song-thaek.\nRi Sol-ju was introduced as Kim Jong-un's wife in state media reports about the opening of an amusement park in July 2012.\nReports simply said he attended the event with his wife, \"Comrade Ri Sol-ju\".\nLittle more is known about Ri Sol-Ju, although there has been much speculation about her background since pictures first emerged of Kim Jong-un with an unidentified woman. There is a North Korean singer of the same name, but she is not now thought to be the same person.\nState media did not mention when the couple got married.\nThe grandson of Kim Jong-il and nephew of leader Kim Jong-un has said he wants to \"make things better\" for the people of his country.\nKim Han-sol, 17, spoke of his dreams of reunification of the two Koreas in an television interview in Bosnia, where he is studying.

England.\n\"I hope Scotland does vote Yes so they can take the opportunity to take control of their own affairs,\" he said.\n\"The North of England needs to come together, and it needs to start arguing for proper devolved regional government that is democratically elected and has real powers.\"\nIn 2004 people in the North East of England rejected a devolved regional assembly, which had been proposed by the then Labour Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott.\nLabour's Sedgefield MP Phil Wilson said people in the North East still did not want their own regional assembly.\nHe said: \"Ten years ago people voted against the idea of a regional assembly but they did vote to create a unitary authority in County Durham.\"\n\"That authority has persuaded companies like Hitachi to build their new

He won by 3,766 votes after second preferences of those who opted for other candidates were counted.\nMr Street said it was the start of a \"new, urban Conservative agenda\".\nOverall, 26% of eligible voters chose a candidate with most people staying away from the polling stations on Thursday.\nThe result is a big upset for Labour, which won 21 out of 28 constituencies in the 2015 general election.\nMr Street, whose high-profile election campaign is reported to have cost almost \u00c2\u00a31m, gave up his business career last year to stand for the newly-created mayoral post.\nIn his victory speech, Mr Burnham promised to be a mayor for everyone in the area whether they voted for him or not.\nThe 47-year-old former health secretary, who represented Leigh as an MP, said: \"This is the dawn of a new era, not just for this city region but for politics in our country, that has been too London-centric for too long.\n\"The old political and party structures haven't delivered for all people and all places. They have created this crisis in politics which we are living through now.\"\nTurnout was just under 29%, ranging from 32% in Stockport and Bury to 25% in Salford and Rochdale. Mr Burnham won 63%, with 359,352 votes.\nElsewhere the Conservatives have won at least two of the six new mayoral contests and are in the lead in two more.\nIn Tees Valley, Conservative Ben Houchen won after a run-off against Labour's Sue Jeffrey.\nTurnout was just 21%.\nMr Houchen described the result a \"political earthquake\" after he won by 481 votes in the first round but extended his lead after the second preferences of those who had voted for the other candidates were re-counted.\nConservative Tim Bowles was declared the winner in the West of England, where turnout was less than 30%.\nHowever, experts said this was better than the historically low turnouts for police and crime commissioners.\nSteve Rotheram won the role as mayor of Liverpool City Region with 171,176 votes, on a turnout of 26%.\nMr Rotheram, who was the MP for Liverpool Walton since 2010, was declared the winner after the first round of counting because he received more than 50% of votes cast.\nTurnout was low in all areas of the region, averaging just 26.1%. Just 20.5% of people voted in Halton, while 28.6% voted in Liverpool.\nMr Bowles won the \u00c2\u00a362,000-a-year West of England post with 70,300 votes.

That's broadly in line with turn out for the county council elections that happened yesterday and with local elections generally. It's certainly far better than the disastrously low turnout we saw in the first police and crime commissioner elections.\n\"The new metro mayors will be local government leaders working with other leaders, often heading cabinets of council leaders: this level of turnout will mean they can do this with the same level of mandate as the rest of local government.\n\"Most incoming mayors will be privately pleased with this level of turnout, while hoping to raise their profile in office and improve significantly upon it next time they go to the polls.\"\nSimon Edwards, director of the County Councils Network, said: \"The picture across the country where turnout figures are available shows that more people are getting out to vote in county areas compared to the urban metro mayor contests.\n\"Importantly, this arguably shows people identify more with their county and the strong local governance already in place in rural England, showcasing why there should not be an arbitrary requirement for a directly-elected mayor in place for significant devolution deals to take place in England's counties.\"\nA government spokesman said: \"Turnout in the first ever regional \"metro\" mayoral elections is in line with recent elections of a similar size.

They needed Philippe Coutinho to be at his creative best to unlock a disciplined Burnley but the midfielder rarely made a telling pass while in attack Divock Origi failed to manage a single shot on goal.\nThe win may not have been pretty but that is something Liverpool have struggled to do this season and Klopp believes a corner may have been turned.\n\"It's the first ugly game we've won,\" he said.\n\"In the end I liked it - this is the kind of game we haven't won and we did.\"\nFor 44 minutes, it was the perfect away performance for Burnley.\nThey got an early goal and then successfully nullified Liverpool to the point that a frustrated home crowd started to turn against their side.\nBut a one-goal lead meant they were always susceptible to getting caught out and the Clarets need to learn to kill off a game - only once have they scored more than one goal in an away game this season.\nBurnley's home form is likely to ensure they are in the Premier League next season - they are seven points above the relegation zone with 10 games remaining.\nHowever, a return of just two points from a possible 42 on the road this season will be of major concern for manager Sean Dyche.\nLiverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"Burnley were always in the game, it was intense and we had to fight.

As a conductor of electricity it performs as well as copper, and as a conductor of heat it outperforms all other known materials.\nThe unusual electronic, mechanical and chemical properties of graphene at the molecular scale promise ultra-fast transistors for electronics.\nSome scientists have predicted that graphene could one day replace silicon - which is the current material of choice for transistors.\nIt could also yield incredibly strong, flexible and stable materials and find applications in transparent touch screens or solar cells.\nGeim and Novoselov first isolated fine sheets of graphene from the graphite which is widely used in pencils.\nA layer of graphite 1mm thick actually consists of three million layers of graphene stacked on top of one another.\nThe layers are weakly held together and are therefore fairly simple to tear off and separate.\nThe researchers used ordinary sticky tape to rip off thin flakes from a piece of graphite.\nThen they attached the flakes to a silicon plate and used a microscope to identify the thin layers of graphene among larger fragments of graphite and carbon scraps.\nProfessor Martin Rees, president of the UK's Royal Society commented: \"It would be hard to envisage better exemplars of the value of enabling outstanding individuals to pursue 'open-ended' research projects whose outcome is unpredictable.\nIn an apparent reference to the threatened cuts to UK science funding, he added: \"There are surely important lessons to be drawn by the government from the Nobel Committee's decision.\n\"The UK must sustain our science at a competitive level in a world where talent is mobile and other countries are advancing fast.\"\nOn Monday, the Nobel Foundation announced that British scientist Robert Edwards, the man who devised the fertility treatment IVF, had been awarded this year's prize for medicine.\nProfessor Peter Main, director of education and science at the Institute of Physics, said, \"We're delighted to see two UK-based physicists take the prize.\n\"Following yesterday's win for Prof Edwards, there could be no clearer sign of just how much the UK punches above its international weight in a very competitive scientific world.\"\nTen years ago, Prof Geim and Prof Sir Michael Berry from the University of Bristol were jointly awarded an Ig Nobel prize for their experiments using magnetic fields to levitate frogs.\nThese tongue-in-cheek awards for \"improbable research\" have become almost as famous as the real Nobels.\nThe Nobel prizes also cover chemistry, medicine, literature, peace and economics (more properly called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize).

It has declared its territory a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law - under its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\nIS demands allegiance from all Muslims, rejects national borders and seeks to expand its territory.

Then, in the 1990s, data from the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico revealed areas that strongly reflect radar - a characteristic of ice.\nMany of these corresponded to the locations of large impact craters mapped by the US spacecraft Mariner 10 in the 1970s.\nAfter the Messenger probe entered orbit around the planet in March 2011, it deployed a range of techniques to show that there are probably several billion tonnes of water ice locked up at the north pole.\nIn the latest study, Dr Nancy Chabot and colleagues studied an impact crater called Prokofiev, the largest such depression at the planet's north pole.\nThe uniform surface texture of presumed water-ice areas in Prokofiev crater suggest the deposits arrived relatively recently.\nIn other areas, water-ice is covered by a thin layer of dark material rich in organic molecules. These dark deposits display sharp boundaries.\n\"This result was a little surprising, because sharp boundaries indicate that the volatile deposits at Mercury's poles are geologically young,\" said Dr Chabot.\nShe added: \"One of the big questions we've been grappling with is 'When did Mercury's water ice deposits show up?' Are they billions of years old, or were they emplaced only recently?\n\"Understanding the age of these deposits has implications for understanding the delivery of water to all the terrestrial planets, including Earth.\"\nOverall, the images indicate that Mercury's polar deposits either were delivered to the planet recently or are regularly restored at the surface through an ongoing process.\nDistinctions between the features of shadowed craters on the Moon and those on Mercury may also be instructive about the history of water in the Solar System.\nThe Moon is also believed to host deposits of water-ice, also being home to areas of permanent shadow. They are also colder than those on Mercury. But there are significant differences in the properties of the surface as measured from orbit.\nOne explanation could be that the deposits on Mercury are more recent.\n\"If Mercury's currently substantial polar volatile inventory is the product of the most recent portion of a longer process, then a considerable mass of volatiles may have been delivered to the inner Solar System throughout its history,\" the paper in Geology says.\n\"That's a key question,\" said Dr Chabot.\n\"Because if you can understand why one body looks one way and another looks different, you gain insight into the process that's behind it, which in turn is tied to the age and distribution of water-ice in the Solar System.\n\"This will be a very interesting line of inquiry going forward.\"\nFollow Paul on Twitter.", "One house is the family home of Talal Alameddine who was detained in October over the terror-linked killing of a police worker outside a police station.\nMr Alameddine is accused of supplying the gun which Farhad Jabar, 15, used to murder police accountant Curtis Cheng.\nPolice said the searches were conducted under firearms legislation, but that no \"items of interest\" were found.\n\"Any threat to police officers or police premises is of major concern and taken extremely seriously, as demonstrated by the operation we undertook today,\" Assistant Commissioner Jenkins said in a statement on Wednesday., without giving further details.\n\"We will continue to take every precaution necessary to protect our officers and the safety of the wider community, and will respond swiftly to any specific threats that are received.\"\nHe said the raids were carried out by the Middle Eastern Organised Crime Squad and Tactical Operations Unit officers, along with local police and other specialist units.\nMr Cheng was shot dead outside his office in Parramatta on 2 October in what the authorities say was a terror-related attack.\nIran-born Jabar was shot dead by police at the scene.\nIn the wake of the shooting, a number of people, including Mr Alameddine were arrested during police raids on several properties.\nMr Alameddine was released but later re-arrested and charged.\nAustralia has stepped up counter-terrorism efforts in recent months in the face of what officials say is a growing security threat from radical Islamists.", "Edwin Mee, 46, is accused of exploiting his position of trust and power to abuse or rape women while working at Army offices in Croydon, south east London.\nMr Mee, of Tavistock Road, Croydon, denied the allegations.\nHe told Southwark Crown Court the Army was his \"life\".\nMr Mee is charged with 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration against 11 victims in 2010 and 2011.\nThe alleged attacks happened while he was working at the Mitcham Barracks Army Careers and Information Office in Croydon.\nAsked in court by Lisa Wilding QC, defending, how he responded to the allegations, Mr Mee replied: \"That never happened ma'am.\"\nThe court heard that he joined the army aged 24 and went on to serve in Iraq -

or his failure to win the Premier League since 2003/04 - after Watford's shock 2-1 quarter-final win at Emirates Stadium.\nSo no FA Cup, as good as out of the Champions League as Arsenal attempt to overturn a 2-0 deficit against holders Barcelona in the Nou Camp on Wednesday, and eight points behind Premier League leaders Leicester City after two losses and a draw in their last three league games.\nThe 66-year-old is a towering figure in Arsenal's history - but if The Gunners finish this season empty-handed it must be time for Wenger to consider relinquishing control of the club he has served with such distinction since September 1996.\nSo why should the end of Wenger's era be on the agenda?\nNo Arsenal fan - even Wenger's fiercest detractors - would wish to see a wonderful career peter out to the soundtrack of growing criticism after bringing four titles, which also included two doubles with the FA Cup, and six FA Cup triumphs in all.\nThere comes a time, however, when any manager's recent record must be subjected to close scrutiny, irrespective of the past. It is not a vendetta or a personal campaign against Wenger, simply an examination of unflattering facts.\nIt is the law, the reality, of football management.\nAnd if Arsenal do not win the title this season, a campaign they have almost been waiting for in many respects, the time would be right to hand over power because there are no signs that Wenger is close to recreating his successes of the past.\nIf he fails again, Wenger will have faltered with Arsenal's rivals all stumbling around them. Chelsea have imploded, Manchester City have been indifferent and Manchester United have been off the radar.\nIt would be a desperate reflection on Wenger and his team if they fail to take advantage of that collection of circumstances.\nSince that last title, on the back of 38 games unbeaten, Wenger has only finished second once, in the following season. There have been six fourth-placed finished and four seasons in third. Arsenal have rarely threatened to actually win the title again.\nAnd if they go out to Barcelona, it is will be their sixth successive Champions League exit at the last 16 stage.\nIf history repeats itself this season, then it must be the end of the old \"Arsene Knows\" and \"In Arsene We Trust\" mantras, and change must be considered. Wenger cannot be immune from the normal measures of success and failure.\nAny regular visitor to Emirates Stadium will sense the growing frustration and fury among Arsenal fans as their team falls short - an understandable emotion they rightly feel at this huge club.\nThere were reports of Arsenal supporters confronting each other after the FA Cup loss while a tetchy Wenger described criticism (justified given Arsenal's recent record) as \"a farce\".\nArsenal fans brandished a prominent banner at the 4-0 FA Cup fifth round replay win at Hull City bearing the words: \"Arsene. Thanks For The Memories But It's Time To Say Goodbye.\"\nThe air can only be cleared by a trophy and will become more polluted by criticism should Arsenal, as they so often have under Wenger in recent times, come up short once more. Or it could be cleared by a change of manager.\nThere is growing unrest, not helped by Leicester City's rise to the top and north London rivals Tottenham moving into second place, with Wenger inevitably the central figure and the focal point for fans' disappointments.\nThis, in reality, means winning the Premier League. Surely Wenger's future now largely hinges on that.\nArsenal's flaws remain the same this season as they have for so many of the barren years. Responsibility for that lies with the manager.\nWenger has invested in big signings by bringing in \u00a342.4m Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid and Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona for \u00a332m - but old failings have been left unattended to undermine Arsenal.\nIndeed, Arsenal were the only major club in Europe's top five leagues not to sign a single outfield player last summer. Show of faith or flawed gamble? It will be seen as the latter if Arsenal win nothing.\nArsenal have lacked a powerful midfield presence for many years, yet Wenger has failed to address the problem. It has led to a heavy burden of responsibility being placed on Francis Coquelin, with a free transfer in his second spell at the club, Mathieu Flamini, as back-up.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nAnd while Olivier Giroud is a serviceable Premier League striker, he is short of true world-class and once again Wenger has failed to produce. Arsenal have been linked with Luis Suarez, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuain, to no avail.\nWenger's once golden touch in spotting and capturing the best youngsters also seems to have deserted him, with Juventus snapping up the brilliant 22-year-old Argentine Paulo Dybala and Borussia Dortmund's Pierre Emerick Aubameyang stating he has no interest in moving to north London.\nHe was on Arsenal's radar when he was at St Etienne but moved to the Bundesliga in 2013.\nWenger bristles at suggestions Arsenal lack natural leaders but their constant failures and mental weakness at pressure points suggest otherwise - as seen against Watford and also when they lost 3-2 to a youthful and injury-hit Manchester United in February.\nThese problems have been a narrative in Arsenal's failures - and Wenger has not changed the storyline.\nArsenal's board will not escape scrutiny either, but Wenger has never suggested in recent years that he was stopped from spending money. He has simply adopted a frugal approach that has seen the club left behind.\nSometimes a manager's time simply comes to a conclusion. Twenty years is a lifetime in football and Wenger may well be the last Premier League manager to preside over a dynasty.\nAnd, no matter how fiercely the desire burns to bring back the former glories, a fresh voice is needed - and that time may have finally arrived at Arsenal.\nChange is often required to refresh hearts and minds and simply blow away the cobwebs within a club. This is not a criticism of Wenger, simply that a manager's timespan just comes to an end.\nWenger's words praising Arsenal's spirit and attitude have been a constant accompaniment to a lack of silverware and it has been present again during a run of just four wins in 14 games.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt is a familiar sound, but a hollow one after defeats, and maybe it has become too familiar to his players. They do not back up Wenger's words with actions - maybe they now need to hear someone else.\nHistory will remember Wenger as one of British football's greatest managers, but all good things must come to an end and some results and performances in recent weeks have smacked of the last days of his reign.\nThere is no agenda against Wenger. There is barely anyone who would begrudge him a happy ending at Arsenal.\nFootball, however, is not always like that.\nThis is now actually the biggest problem facing Arsenal's board after their years of complete loyalty to Wenger. It has meant those who would be a perfect fit for the club have gone elsewhere.\nTwo of the prime contenders are no longer available. Pep Guardiola, who many believe would have seen Arsenal's location, infrastructure and financial power as his perfect Premier League platform, is joining Manchester City, while Jurgen Klopp is at Liverpool.\nManuel Pellegrini will be available at the end of the season after leaving Manchester City, but is the 62-year-old an upgrade on Wenger?\nJose Mourinho is also available but he seems destined for other parts and is hardly the sort of combustible character Arsenal's board would consider, despite his great success.

But at the time there were limited expectations for her as the daughter of West Indian immigrants. \"That's what they felt my career path would be.\"\nThese days, while some may question the continuing relevance of lists such as the Powerlist in 21st Century Britain, Ms Blackett insists they are still \"incredibly useful\".\n\"It shows the diversity of different jobs or careers that people can go into.

In other words, it does not prove that firms are more profitable just because they are diverse - there could well be other factors at play here.\nMcKinsey is rightly cautious about reading too much into its figures, merely saying that the existence of the relationship is statistically significant and consistently present in the data.\n\"There is a significant correlation between diversity and performance,\" says UK managing partner, Vivian Hunt. \"We don't claim by any means [the data] is perfect but it demonstrates the correlation.\"\nYet intuitively, many in business do feel that it does make clear commercial sense to recruit at all levels from as wide a pool as possible.\n\"When businesses open themselves up to a wide range of opinions, backgrounds, ages, genders and sexualities - it enables innovation and counters groupthink,\" says Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors (IoD).\n\"Commerce is now a truly global affair, but sometimes it seems that companies have failed to grasp this when it comes to their own staff,\" he adds.\nKaren Blackett makes the point that: \"If you can have people on your boards that can build empathy and understand the target audience, you're future-proofing your business.\"\nWhen it comes to broadening Britain's boardroom diversity, many are looking to the United States and in particular, American football's so-called Rooney Rule that has helped change the make-up of management within the sport.\nUnder this rule, when National Football League (NFL) teams recruit a new head coach they have to interview at least one black or African-American candidate.\nThe rule could soon be in place in the sporting arena in England too, with Football Association chairman Greg Dyke saying a form of the rule to boost the number of black and ethnic minority coaches in England might be \"a good way forward\".\nThe media magnate Robert Johnson, chairman of the RLJ group and the US's first African-American billionaire, is calling for US firms to consider more non-white candidates for jobs.\nHe wants US companies to interview at least two African-American candidates for every job opening at vice-president level and above.\n\"The idea is to create something called enhanced best practice,\" says Mr Johnson, best-known for founding Black Entertainment Television, the first cable television network aimed at African-Americans.\n\"You do this because it is in the best interests of your company, best interests of the community, and the best interests of diversity in this nation.\n\"Without that I don't believe you can ever close the employment gap, the wealth gap and the talent gap between white Americans and black Americans,\" he says.\n\"The idea is to say to all Americans that this country would be better off if you made sure that the 30 million African-Americans be given a fair chance to succeed in jobs and business opportunities.\"\nBut this is not a call for quotas, he says.\n\"If they are talented, they get the opportunity, if they're not talented, you don't hire them. There's no mandate to hire anybody, it's only a mandate to consider someone for a job.\"\nMr Johnson says he has been pleased by the political support his proposal has received from both Republicans and Democrats.\nBack in Britain, Karen Blackett agrees that a UK corporate version of the Rooney Rule could be beneficial.\n\"I think the Rooney Rule could be an interesting model,\" she says, \"That doesn't influence outcome. What it does do is influence input.\n\"I personally don't agree with quotas just because there could be negative repercussions.\n\"I do believe in making sure you widen the net, because at the end of the day you want the very best candidate.\n\"You need to make sure you're fishing [in] not just one part of the pond.\"", "The Belgium international, 24, has scored two goals in six Premier League appearances this season and was replaced at half-time by Danny Ings, who scored his first goal for the club.\nEngland striker Daniel Sturridge also started after five months out injured.\nThe Reds host Carlisle in the third round of the League Cup on Wednesday.\nDespite the concern over Benteke - a \u00a332.5m signing from Aston Villa in July - first-team coach Gary McAllister praised 23-year-old Ings for getting off the mark in his fourth appearance.\n\"If anyone deserved a goal, it's Danny Ings,\" said McAllister of the former Burnley player.\n\"He's worked his socks off every day here.

There's a seller, an (anonymous) buyer and an auctioneer to conduct proceedings.\nBut the opaque nature of the art world means trophy sales, such as the one last night in New York, are rarely that simple.\nThe auction houses are desperate for top-quality product and will go to great lengths to secure grade A works for their most prestigious sales. They might, for example, waive their fees for selling the work.\nOn occasion, they may even offer a guaranteed price to the owner, whether the work sells or not.\nThis, though, is a very high-risk practice. So they can offset the risk by arranging for outside investors to underwrite the guarantee.

Neither of these issues could possibly be described as having been resolved.\nBut it is the 1975 referendum on Britain's continued membership of Europe that provides the best example.\nEven with a stonking majority of two-to-one (67.2% to 32.8%) in favour of remaining within what was then called the European Community, and on a decent 65% turnout, Roy Jenkins' vainglorious claim at the time that \"it puts the uncertainty behind us, it commits Britain to Europe\" appears now to be merely a statement of hope over expectation.\nThe contrary has proved to be the case.\nA disquiet runs like a fault line through British public opinion from Parliament to the pub, and so it is that Prime Minister David Cameron has embarked upon a second European referendum campaign asking almost exactly the same question and for precisely the same reason as his predecessor Harold Wilson in 1975.\nHe wants to hold his party together sufficiently to be able to run his government effectively, just as Wilson did 40 years ago. The main difference between then and now is that all the trouble came previously from radicals who were mostly on the left, while the government's problems today are the go-it-alone nationalists who are mostly on the political right.\nThere is also the question of British public opinion.\nIn 1975, most of the establishment was in favour of staying in the \"Common Market\" we had joined two years earlier. It was a philosophy, a commitment, a vision of post-War international consensus.\nBut there was opposition and some of it from powerful places.\nEnoch Powell resigned as a Conservative MP before the first 1974 election, with a clarion call urging the country to vote Labour because of its opposition to Europe. There were a few other radical right-wing opposing voices.\nMost significantly, there was the Labour and trade union movement.\nLabour promised in the October 1974 election to hold a consultative referendum if a renegotiation of terms of membership was deemed acceptable by the government.\nRoy Jenkins resigned as deputy leader in consequence, correctly suspecting that this was a cosmetic exercise to appease the party's left wing and the-then powerful trade unions.\nWilson undertook to use his \"best endeavours\" in the renegotiation process, which became a phrase in ironic daily use. In reality, best endeavours boiled down to securing some minor protection for New Zealand butter.\nIt was enough, however, to secure the passage of the legislation to hold the referendum, which was carried with the support of the majority of Conservative MPs, including their new leader, Margaret Thatcher.\nMore Labour MPs were opposed than in favour (148 against; 138 for) and 32 abstained.\nAt a tense special Labour conference, just two months before the referendum, the party voted against Europe by nearly two-to-one, a majority hugely assisted by the fact that 39 of the party's 46 affiliated trade unions voted against. It was a triumph for the left.\nIt meant that Wilson had to suspend the doctrine of collective ministerial responsibility to allow seven - nearly a third - of the 23 members of his cabinet to campaign against official government policy, (as, in my view, Cameron would be wise also to concede).\nIt allowed the late Alistair McAlpine, treasurer of the \"Yes\" campaign, later Treasurer of the Tory Party and later still an enthusiastic member of Sir James Goldsmith's anti-European Referendum Party, to portray Labour's opponents of Europe - Michael Foot, Tony Benn, Barbara Castle and Peter Shore among them - as \"dangerous people\" who were \"virtually Marxist\".\nBritish public opinion was led then by the establishment view of the safe option, as it undoubtedly will be in the coming referendum - which Mr Cameron will probably call as early as next May to coincide with Scottish and local elections - despite the shifts in the sands of political opinion in the intervening years.\nThis is a factor that will help Mr Cameron, as it helped Wilson, to secure the same endorsement.\nMr Cameron has the additional assistance of the support of the Scottish Nationalist Party, whose political significance is considerably greater today than 40 years ago when they voted \"No\", of the Democratic Unionists and Plaid Cymru (also opposed to Europe in 1975) and the Greens.\nNigel Farage, the leader of UKIP, is regarded by many as being rather too populist to lead a responsible opposition to the massed forces of the political establishment, the City and the business community.\nYet the public support for the case his party has made in succession to the Referendum Party is constant.\nThere remains a profound antipathy to the European Union, which Mr Cameron will need to address.\nThe amorphous changes he is seeking in Europe - reforming benefits, bureaucracy and busybody Brussels - can easily be achieved within his meaningless overall objective of resisting \"ever closer union\".\nIt may be enough to buy off an obedient electorate.

There were 110 people present, among them five members of Mr Bo's family and two companions, 19 journalists and 84 people \"from all walks of life\".\nAfter the legal teams sat down and the judge entered the courtroom, Bo Xilai was summoned.\nThe court briefly profiled  him, giving his date of birth as 3 July 1949, providing details of his education and his stellar list of public postings.\nThe chairing judge, Justice Wang Xuguang, deputy head of the court, introduced himself and his two fellow judges and the legal teams, read Mr Bo's rights to him and kicked off proceedings.\nMr Bo was charged with receiving 21.79m yuan ($3.56m; \u00c2\u00a32.28m) in bribes from two businessmen in the city of Dalian, Xu Ming and Tang Xiaolin.\nProsecutors say Mr Bo took the bribes directly, or through his wife Gu Kailai and his son Bo Guagua.  Analysts say this is the first time the younger Bo has been formally linked to the scandal.\nIn addition it is alleged that Mr Bo diverted an $800,000 payment to the city into personal funds with his wife's help.\nThe indictment also focuses on the abuse of power charges and makes the explicit link to the dramatic case of his wife, Gu Kailai, jailed last year for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.\nIt says Mr Bo \"committed a series of power abuses, after the relevant personnel reported and exposed the intentional homicide case of Bogu Kailai\".\nThe corruption charges relate to the alleged embezzlement of 5m yuan of public funds from the Dalian government in 2002.\nThe blog says defence lawyers and prosecutors cross-examined the evidence presented, but no details about this were immediately disclosed. Mr Bo himself later cross-examined Mr Xu, one of the men he is alleged to have received bribes from.\nThe blog posted its first pictures of Bo Xilai along with other images taken from inside the medium-sized, sober courtroom.\nIt shows a clean-shaven Bo standing in the dock without handcuffs, his hands crossed in front of him, and flanked by two policemen. He is wearing an open-necked white shirt.\nIn one of the pictures, Bo Xilai is seen sitting, and He Zhengsheng, the lawyer representing murdered Briton Neil Heywood's family is sitting in the front row, directly behind Mr Bo.\nThe court blog reproduces what could be the first terse exchanges between the judge and Bo Xilai.\nBo Xilai: I hope the judge will try this case fairly and justly according to the law of the country.  Judge: Your wish has been understood. The court will be independent and follow the judicial process and try the case according to the law.\nThen proceedings turn to the bribery accusations and when referring to one of the bribery charges set out against him, Mr Bo says that he admitted those charges against his will.\nAnalysts following the blog say this appears to be the first indication of Mr Bo taking a defiant stance and denying the charges set out against him.\n\"That Tang Xiaolin gave me three bribes - that did not happen.  He asked me to help him sort out something, and these were all done according to procedure.\n\"I admitted against my will taking three bribes from Tang Xiaolin,\" he told the judge.\nAfter lunch the trial becomes notably more heated, as the court's blog reproduces Mr Bo's angry reaction to the evidence against him.\nThe testimony (which runs to seven statements) of Tang Xiaolin  -  the businessman accused of bribing Bo Xilai - was transcribed and in this he admits bribing Mr Bo.\nFrom the court's blog, Mr Bo is dismissive and he calls Tang Xiaolin, who was not in court, a \"crazy dog snapping at things for reward\", arguing that his evidence has no credibility because he is only trying to reduce his sentence.\nIndeed Mr Bo called Tang Xiaolin's testimony \"the ugly performance of a person selling his soul\" - upon which the judge warns him not to make defamatory comments.\nHe still says the businessman's actions are a \"blasphemy\", an affront to the sanctity of the courtroom. Mr Bo also says he only admitted the bribery charges under pressure.\nSome of Mr Bo's fiercest words are directed towards his wife Gu Kailai - prosecutors had provided the court with written testimony from her against her husband.\nIn her statement, she said she took money several times from safes at her homes in Dalian, Shenyang and Chongqing, safes which only Gu and Mr Bo could open. She said she took the money to the UK for her son's studies.\nBut her husband called her words \"ridiculous\", saying she could not prove the money she took had been from those safes and questioned whether she could even remember the amount she took.\nThe blog also cited Bo's lawyer as saying that Gu is \"mentally unsound\" and that her words cannot be trusted.\nBut, according to the court blog, the judge is not inclined to agree. He says that so many witnesses corroborate her claims - so the allegations must be true.\nOne of the biggest surprises of the first day was Mr Bo being given the chance to cross-examine key prosecution witness Xu Ming.\nMr Bo first rejects the charge that he accepted 20 million yuan in bribes from the Dalian businessman as \"completely untrue\", and says he \"knew nothing\" about a property owned by Gu Kailai near Nice in southern France, which Mr Xu admitted paying for.\n\"Gu Kailai, Xu Ming and Bo Guagua never filled me in on their dealings,\" the court blog quotes Mr Bo as saying.\nThen he puts a series of questions to the businessman.\nBo Xilai: You said you supported Bo Guagua and you covered his expenses for airline tickets, credit cards and other things. Have you ever told me that? Xu Ming: No.\nBo Xilai: Have you ever told me about Africa, that you covered their expenses? [Referring to a trip Bo Guagua was said to have taken with friends that was allegedly funded by Xu Ming.] Xu Ming: No.\nBo Xilai: Thank you for being truthful. You bought Gu Kailai expensive items. You bought Bo Guagua luxury watches and have you ever told me that? Xu Ming: No.\nBo Xilai: You said that Bo Guagua and Gu Kailai spent millions every year while they were living overseas. Have you ever told me that? Xu Ming: No.\nBo Xilai: Have you ever told me about the property in Nice? Xu Ming: I mentioned [in my testimony] that I talked about it in your house at the dinner table and another time at the ministry of commerce. Bo Xilai: Apart from those two occasions? Xu Ming: No.\nEarlier, Xu Ming's testimony gave more details about Fontaine Saint Georges, the villa Gu Kailai owned near Nice which was once managed by British businessman Neil Heywood.\nXu Ming: In 2000, Gu Kailai told me that she wanted to buy a villa in France, I gave her $3.23m. I also gave her money to cover travel and living costs. When her son [Bo Guagua] and his friend wanted to go to Africa, I gave him about 100,000 yuan. Gu Kailai approached me in October 2001 with Bo Guagua's credit card bill for about 300,000 yuan, I paid it.\nIn April 2011 Gu Kailai told me in her Chongqing residence that foreigners were not reliable, she needed to find some other person to manage Fontaine Saint Georges. Gu Kailai also called [city police chief] Wang Lijun, telling him to keep a good tab on her French friend Devillers, and not to let him leave China.\nI said I have a good friend who was reliable and a British citizen [meaning Jiang Feng Dolby], we can just leave her to deal with the procedures.\nProsecutor: What did she mean by saying that foreigners are not reliable? Did she mean that it was a threat to her property? Xu Ming: I can't tell. We were talking over the phone and could not talk in details.\nRare details of Bo Xilai's marriage and his life since he was last seen in public 18 months ago also emerged in court.\n\"During the disciplinary hearings most members of the investigation team [from the central disciplinary committee of the Communist Party] were polite and rational, the living conditions were good, healthcare was good, most comrades were civilised and polite,\" Mr Bo said in one part of the transcript released by the court.\n\"But that does not dispel what I said about mental pressure. These pressures were real,\" he added, suggesting he was pressurised into confessing to taking bribes.\nLate in the day a transcript was released in which Bo Xilai described his family set-up and relations with his wife, who it appears he rarely met. He says he could not have known about money given by Xu Ming - because he and Gu Kailai did not talk about such matters as they hardly saw each other.\n\"I believe Gu Kailai is a cultured person with taste, a modern intellectual woman. Each time she meets up with me we always talk about things that we have in common. But I only had limited contact with her. Before 2007, she was living overseas. During her rare visits back to China she spent only limited amounts of time with me.\n\"When we had so little time together it was impossible for us to talk about Xu Ming covering their travelling costs.  Gu Kailai would never talk about something so vulgar in front of me. After 2008 I started my work in Chongqing and again we did not spend enough time together.\n\"It is not possible that she would have talked to me about such expenses during the limited time we spent together. Xu Ming was Gu Kailai's friend and not mine.\"\nThe court released a few more details of the trial late on Thursday evening.  In those closing sessions the defence lawyer read out from a previous statement from businessman Xu Ming in which he revealed that he had been approached by now-jailed police chief of Chongqing Wang Lijun on 27 January 2012 to ask Bo Xilai to rein in Gu Kailai, and ask her to be less intimidating.\nThe implication is that her behaviour had got out of hand.  Xu Ming says he did not approach Bo Xilai but the defence lawyer referred him to his statement in which he said he had been warned by Wang Lijun that if Bo Xilai wasn't approached, something \"shocking and explosive would happen and it would be impossible to control\".\nThen the defence lawyer reads out from Xu Ming's statement in which what appears to be the the first mention of Neil Heywood's murder is made:\n\"On 28 January 2012 in the evening, Wang Lijun returned to his office after talking to Bo Xilai. I (Xu Ming) went to Wang Lijun's office. I sensed that Wang Lijun was very excited, he said that he told Bo Xilai about four crimes committed by Gu Kailai, including the murder of Neil Heywood and said everyone who took part in the investigation of Neil Heywood's death would have to resign... He felt he had a good talk with Bo Xilai. I felt Wang Lijun was threatening Bo Xilai.\"\nIt was reportedly days later that Wang Lijun was sacked by Bo Xilai and on 6 February he entered the US consulate in Beijing precipitating the series of events that brought about Bo Xilai's downfall.", "The Beggarwood practice \"put patients at risk of harm\", the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said.\nCQC inspectors visited the Basingstoke surgery in February, and said two of GPs felt the practice was \"clinically unsafe due to staff shortages\".\nThe GPs are leaving this month, but operator Cedar Medical insists the surgery has \"adequate staffing\".\nMore on this and other stories from across the south of England.\nThe CQC said it was \"worrying\" standards had \"declined\" since a previous inspection in May last year found the surgery \"required improvement\".\nIt said patients' records were not kept up to date, some staff were not properly trained and the surgery team was \"disengaged\".\nRuth Rankine, Deputy Chief Inspector of General Practice, said: \"While the majority of staff were viewed as caring, there seemed to be a lack of commitment from the leadership.\"\nShe said fire risk assessments had not been acted on and some staff did not know where emergency equipment was stored.\nPatients were waiting up to four to six weeks for routine appointments, the report said.\nA notice on the surgery website, which lists five GPs, said four of them were leaving between 1 and 9 June.\nIt said: \"We are in the process of recruiting two full time equivalent GPs and two full time equivalent Advanced Nurse Practitioners.\"\nCedar Medical, part of the Integral Medical Holdings (IMH) group, said it was supporting Beggarwood after the surgery's funding was \"reduced across the board\".\nIMH director Richard Power, said: \"There is currently an adequate number of clinicians.\"\nThe NHS North Hampshire Clinical Commissioning Group said \"taking all necessary steps\" to ensure progress.", "Dennis Dovey, 50, of Alcock Avenue, Mansfield, died from his injuries sustained in the crash on the A614 at Ollerton on Friday afternoon.\nThe collision happened on the southbound carriageway of the A614 near to the railway bridge.\nNottinghamshire police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the crash to contact them.", "Nigel Wilson admitted nine breaches of taking video over football grounds and tourist attractions last year.\nWilson, from Bingham, Nottinghamshire, was originally accused of 17 breaches of the Air Navigation Order but some charges were dropped due to insufficient evidence.\nHe was fined \u00a31,800 at Westminster Magistrates' Court.\nIt was the first case in England of a person being prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service for using drones after a police-led operation.\nWilson, 42, was accused by Scotland Yard of flying the aircraft unmanned and \"failing to maintain direct visual contact\".\nThe charges he admitted included flying the drone on:\nThe court heard police horses were startled by Wilson's device as it flew over a Champions League group stage game between Liverpool and Bulgarian visitors Ludogorets at Anfield.\nHe was also twice arrested in London and had his drones confiscated.\nDistrict Judge Quentin Purdy told Wilson, a security guard, he had put the public at risk by flying the drones over busy, built-up areas.\nHe said: \"At each and every one of these places an accident could have occurred simply by a gust of wind or something of that nature taking it out of your control.\n\"In each and every case you knew what you were doing.

In the wake of Red Bull's decision to swap Daniil Kvyat and Max Verstappen after just four races this season, it looks like he had a point.\nActually, though, it's pretty clear this is about more than the mistakes Kvyat made on the first lap of the Russian Grand Prix last weekend.\nRed Bull's driver programme is all about finding the next multiple world champion, the next Sebastian Vettel. They have been ruthless from the very beginning.\nIt doesn't matter whether it's mid-season or end-of-season, during a contract or at the end of one, if they do not feel someone is in that elite group, they look at another option.\nWhatever your view of this decision, you have to say that Red Bull give young drivers opportunities.\nThey plucked Kvyat out of GP3 and stuck him straight into F1 in 2014 because they believed he was the next most promising young driver in their programme.\nI first saw the Russian in European Formula Three in 2013. He was quick and looked good but did not particularly stand out or dominate weekends like others have.\nBut when he was promoted to Toro Rosso the following year, he did a really good job alongside Jean-Eric Vergne.\nWhen Sebastian Vettel told Red Bull on the Friday before the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix that he was going to Ferrari, they made an instantaneous decision to promote Kvyat to replace him - even though Fernando Alonso was potentially available.\nNo questions, no deliberations. It was just, \"right, there's an opportunity, this is your chance, prove to us whether you've got it\".\nPart of Red Bull's modus operandi has been to give people the chance, in sometimes difficult circumstances, to see how they cope.\nKvyat had a slow start last season but ultimately outscored team-mate Daniel Ricciardo. He did not out-pace him, though.\nHe did seem to be beginning to sort himself out a bit in the last couple of races this year but the Russian seems to need a little bit of time to get into things - and that is something you don't get at Red Bull.\nKvyat has been criticised from various directions for two first-corner incidents in the last two races. In the last column, I explained why I thought he did nothing wrong in China, despite Vettel's criticisms.\nIn Russia, Kvyat was definitely at fault. He was a bit late on the brakes into Turn Two and hit Vettel up the back. It was a bit silly. And in the second incident at Turn Three he was, up to a point, a victim of circumstances. It was sort of wrong place, wrong time.\nThe problem was it was Vettel again. Had it been someone in the mid-grid and not a potential winner this season, there would not have been such an outcry.\nRed Bull have said that they hope Kvyat can \"regain his form\" by moving back to Toro Rosso, but I don't believe this is about trying to rebuild his confidence because it will be such a blow for him.\nThe chances are he will not be at either Red Bull team next year, never mind regain his position in the main team.\nThey have another young driver knocking on the door in Frenchman Pierre Gasly, and I would expect him to be promoted to Toro Rosso next year in place of Kvyat.\nTo save his F1 career, Kvyat has to make a great comeback. Not every race can be great when you're a driver, but it is the guys who have the ability to turn that around again who have the staying power.\nOn the track, there is a fine line between hero and zero. Kvyat caused a first-corner melee when he hit Vettel in Russia. Not far behind, Alonso used this to help him score McLaren's best result of the season.\nHe stayed on the outside to avoid the chaos, ran through the run-off area perfectly legitimately and gained a lot of positions.\nThat was the foundation for his sixth place - the second-best result since McLaren and Honda began their new partnership, after Alonso's fifth place in Hungary last year.\nThese things happen when you are in the middle of the pack, and it is all too easy to get involved in incidents.\nEqually, it's possible to stop it happening - look at Romain Grosjean. He was the \"first-lap nutcase\" in 2012, and he rightly was pilloried for a number of incidents, because he was in a downward spiral.\nYet he has emerged from that in recent years into an impressive performer, and has scored two fantastic results for the new Haas team this year, with sixth in Australia and fifth in Bahrain.\nAs an F1 driver, the stakes are high, and you don't always get a second chance. Kvyat has sort of got that - and he needs to make the most of it.\nRightly, Red Bull have been keeping a very close eye on Verstappen's development. And they are not the only ones.\nThis is as good a time as any to make this move, as they now have the best part of a season to see how the 18-year-old stands up in the big time. He has done pretty much everything right so far, so why not give him a chance and see what happens? What are they risking?\nAt the same time, though, this shows Red Bull are under pressure.\nFor one thing, other teams are interested in Verstappen, and promoting him might stop him getting itchy feet if, say, Ferrari came calling.\nFor another, the team need to perform and improve after a very difficult 2015. It is not as if they are totally out of the woods in terms of the problems they had last year.\nYes, they are more competitive, and there is a promising engine upgrade coming from Renault for the Canadian Grand Prix in two races' time.\nBut they have no engine deal sorted for next year yet - even if a continuation of their agreement with Renault, and the power-units badged for a sponsor, is by far the most likely scenario.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nVerstappen's debut season last year was undoubtedly highly impressive - in particular for his series of outstanding overtaking moves.\nBut people forget that he was actually out-qualified 10-9 by his Toro Rosso team-mate, Carlos Sainz.\nThey are both very promising, but Verstappen showed he has a very wide and good skill set and he has continued to develop this year. It is three-one to the Dutchman in qualifying after four races in 2016, although the average time difference between them is virtually nothing.\nBut within Red Bull, Verstappen has the momentum and you need to ride that wave when you are on it.\nHe was only signed by Red Bull in mid-2014 - and when they did so it was because they had decided to put him straight into F1 the following year.\nAt the time, the idea was to partner him with Kvyat at Toro Rosso, and it was only when Vettel left that a vacancy arose and Sainz was chosen to fill it.\nThey feel Verstappen is worth a chance, and I can't disagree with them. I don't always like the way they do things - it is harsh, cut-throat and brutal - but you have to keep coming back to my dad and his old sayings.\nRed Bull's motorsport boss Helmut Marko, who makes these decisions, does not smile very much but I can imagine him smirking about the prospect of Verstappen v Ricciardo.\nThe Australian has emerged as a potential superstar in his own right in the last two years, completing overshadowing Vettel in 2014 and proving very fast and classy.\nAfter a brilliant 2014, including three wins, he did not have the best of seasons last year. The car was not very good initially, and he did not adapt to it that well.\nBut once he got the car underneath him, he was rocking and rolling - and he has continued that at the start of this season.\nThere is a lot at stake. Who will come out on top? It's going to be fascinating to find out.\nAllan McNish was talking to BBC Sport's Andrew Benson\nNever want to miss the latest Formula 1 news?

The line caused a public outcry.\n\"That experience definitely fed into that episode, which we call Hated in the Nation, as it deals with people getting trolled on Twitter,\" says Brooker.\n\"My own incident pre-dated Twitter, and my vilification was done by good old-fashioned email, but some of the characters in Hated in the Nation say things that I was experiencing at the time, and I also read a book for research that deals with people caught up in Twitter storms. The author hangs out with them and sees how devastated they are, often by the sheer volume of comments they receive. The whole thing is terrifying.\"\nCompared to a modern Twilight Zone or Tales of the Unexpected, Black Mirror - using technology instead of the supernatural to unnerve - first aired on Channel 4 in 2011.\nBrooker had previously worked on satirical comedy programmes, including Brass Eye and the 11 O' Clock Show.\nBecause Black Mirror usually deals with a futuristic scenario, Brooker and his producer Annabel Jones have been accused of uncannily predicting the future - notably in 2013's The Waldo Moment, which documents a fake politician's unexpected rise to power.\n\"It certainly wasn't based on him, but now a lot of people have come up to me and said, 'that episode predicted Donald Trump,'\" Brooker explains.\n\"The idea actually pre-dates 2011 when I was working on satirical comedy shows. I wanted to do an MP based on a Gorillaz character, and we thought, 'What if you had an ironic MP who ran for office in London's Shoreditch?'.\n\"It was inspired by figures like Boris Johnson and Ali G, and it was exploring the 'what if' scenario with a figurehead who was artificial, so that was a plus for many of the electorate, but he was also crude and unpleasant. However, we thought the episode would fall down as we said 'no one would ever vote for anything so witless and crude'. It wasn't a good comic character, deliberately so.\n\"I think the thing about the appeal of politicians like Boris and Trump is that they are entertainers, and they upend normality. Also, I think we are in a time when someone can be a legend at breakfast, detested by lunchtime and then loved again by dinner - society is that fickle and fast-moving.\"\nEach episode of Black Mirror runs for up to 90 minutes as a self-contained film. The current series, which will appear on the streaming site Netflix, features actors Bryce Dallas-Howard, Alice Eve, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Kelly MacDonald, as well as an episode directed by Atonement's Joe Wright.\n\"Bryce in particular is playing a character that really has totally lost it,\" says Brooker.\n\"The episode, Nosedive, is about how people can rate each other instantly using their phones, and she has lost all sense of self in her bid to gain likes. We're not so far away from it, are we? We rate our cab drivers, our hotels and our food - and I believe another app tried to rate encounters with people until there was a complete outcry.\n\"I don't read the news though and then think 'what's the angle?', I start with a 'what if' idea, and if it relates to something in the real world, so much the better.\n\"A couple of times we've got accidentally lucky.

First the words - they're good. Well, some of them are.\nLet's review a little of what Mitch McConnell had to say as the new majority leader of the Senate.\n\"We do have an obligation to work together on the issues where we can agree,\" he told a news conference in his home state of Kentucky.\n\"Just because we have a two-party system doesn't mean we have to be in perpetual conflict... We're going to pass legislation. Some of it he may not like, but this gridlock and dysfunction can be ended.\"\nAnd from the president, the same cautiously optimistic words, as he acknowledged the Republicans had had a good night.\n\"I'm eager to work with the new Congress to make the next two years as productive as possible. I am committed to making sure that I measure ideas not by whether they are from Democrats or Republicans but whether they work for the American people,\" Mr Obama said.\n\"And that's not to say that we won't disagree over some issues that we're passionate about. We will. Congress will pass some bills I cannot sign. I'm pretty sure I'll take some actions that some in Congress will not like.\n\"That's natural. That's how our democracy works. But we can surely find ways to work together on issues where there's broad agreement among the American people.\"\nSo that's all OK then. Well not quite. There are profound ideological differences, and you don't have to scratch the surface very hard to find the fissures that lie beneath.\nLet's just take one big example - immigration reform. Mr Obama has been frustrated beyond belief that he has been unable to make progress on this. So yesterday, after the conciliatory words, he said he could act unilaterally if necessary.\nBy issuing an executive order, the president can simply bypass Congress - and at a stroke give the opportunity to allow millions of undocumented immigrants to stay in the country.\nMr McConnell said this would be \"poisoning the well... it's like waving a red flag in front of a bull.\" (Why use one metaphor when two will do?)\nSo already within minutes of peace breaking out, you have skirmishing. John Boehner chose a different metaphor - he said if the president continues to act unilaterally, he will be like a child playing with matches and will burn himself.\nAnd then just as the president wants to take action on immigration, the Republicans are equally passionate about reforming/unpicking the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.\nMr Boehner has just said it is hurting the economy. But if the Congress passed legislation to repeal it, it is a 100% certain bet that the president will flash his veto.\nSo on what other issues might we see progress?\nMr Obama has wavered over the Keystone XL pipeline that will run from Canada down to the Gulf of Mexico for fear of offending environmental campaigners ahead of the mid-terms, even though business is desperate for the measure and it would create jobs.\nThe president could trade that for Republican support to back greater spending on infrastructure - roads, bridges and the like.\nCorporate tax reform is firmly on the Republican agenda, but the president would not want to concede this without something back. Perhaps it would be movement on increasing the minimum wage, something that was backed in ballot initiatives in a number of Republican states on the night of the mid-term elections.\nBut you just have to listen to the two sides, and you can only come away with one conclusion: the antipathy and hostility far outweighs any sense of trust.\n\"This is not about politics, this is about doing what is right for the country,\" John Boehner said with absolute sincerity.\nBarack Obama would, with equal sincerity and passion, say exactly the same. They just fundamentally disagree on what is right.\nAnd no amount of bourbon or rounds of golf is going to sort that.", "Police also believe it may have been home to the people responsible for one of the US's most deadly mass shootings.\nAt around 5pm on Wednesday, acting on a tip off, police raided a house on Redland's Center Street, a leafy residential road about 15 minutes' drive from where the San Bernardino shooting occurred.\nUsing battering rams, police smashed through a window and climbed in.\nIt was a quick but measured entry - police were worried the home might contain explosives.\nFrom a house opposite, 20-year-old Adrian Tejeda filmed everything.\n\"[Police said] lock all the doors,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"I got some calls from family saying 'Have you seen the news?'.\n\"I said 'Yeah I can see it because I'm right here!'\"\nLate into Wednesday night police continued to search the property. The surrounding houses were quiet, curtains drawn.\nBut nowhere was forcibly evacuated, a police officer at the scene said, although some residents had opted to leave - perhaps more due to the 20 or so satellite trucks that had descended on the scene, rather than any worry over a possible threat to their safety.\nAs is so often the case in these shocking incidents, those who knew or came into contact with the suspect were surprised that something like this could possibly happen.\n\"What kind of neighbourhood is this?\" Mr Tejeda continues. \"It's peaceful. Nothing really bad happens.\n\"It's a bunch of innocent people.\"\nHe says he thought he had seen the at least one of the suspects in the past, going in and out of the house, but nothing ever stood out as being unusual or strange.

Of the travelling squad, off-spinner Gareth Batty had a poor third Test, left-arm spinner Liam Dawson is uncapped and batsmen Gary Ballance and Ben Duckett are out of form.\nThe selection problems were compounded by errors from the tourists in Mumbai. After winning the toss, England found themselves 220-2 but lost their last eight wickets for 180 runs.\nThen, with chosen spinners Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali disappointing, England missed chances off Virat Kohli, Murali Vijay and Jayant Yadav, who made a double century and two hundreds between them as India racked up a massive 631.\nRealistically, a different England XI or squad is unlikely to have made a great deal of difference. In these conditions, India are vastly superior.\nFormer England batsman Geoffrey Boycott\nIf the pitch in the next Test is going to be like this, you can open the bowling with James Anderson and Ben Stokes. You need an extra spinner and an extra batsman. I don't care who you leave out. You don't pick Stuart Broad because he's a good bowler and he's fit, or Chris Woakes because he's had a fantastic year.\nI would send for another batsman from the Lions. All Gary Ballance has had is nets and drinks, the kid must be soul destroyed. He should be sent home. Ben Duckett isn't good enough when it turns, he's a one-day player. If you're not confident in them, let them go home. The last person they got from the Lions, Keaton Jennings, got a hundred in this match.\nEx-England captain Michael Vaughan\nEngland's spinners aren't as good as India's, but England's batting hasn't been good enough either. They don't have the patience to bat long enough, to play low-risk strokes. They have lots of boundary options, but not enough in terms of defence. Every time England are putting a partnership together, there's a lot of risk.\nEngland have been hammered. You can make up excuses, to say that Virat Kohli is only good in theses conditions, but that is nonsense.\nOn a turning pitch and facing the expertise, accuracy and sleight of hand of off-spinner Ashwin and left-armer Ravindra Jadeja, the best England could have hoped for was to avoid an innings defeat.\nThat wish evaporated in an eight-over blur of high-quality spin bowling that, at times, was close to unplayable.\nThe masterful Ashwin's best trick was his first, a beautifully disguised carrom ball turning the other way to deceive Jonny Bairstow, who missed by some distance and was trapped lbw for 51.\nAfter that, the end came quickly. Chris Woakes was bowled through the gate playing a drive, Rashid flicked to deep mid-wicket and last man Anderson was caught at mid-on.\nOverall, taking in the fourth evening, Ashwin finished the match with five wickets for six runs in the space of 25 deliveries.\nEngland captain Alastair Cook:  \"We need to play almost a perfect game out here to win and we keep missing opportunities out here. It's like we need to take 14 wickets. It's a missed opportunity, there's no doubt about it.\n\"Our seamers have given us great control in this series in general. You watch how India's spinners bowl sometimes, they bowl defensively and keep the score down. Our seamers can do that.\n\"We wanted to try four seamers and two spinners to see how it played to our strengths. This looked a pretty similar wicket to the one we played in Mumbai last time, but I think it spun more.\nIndia captain Virat Kohli: \"This is probably the sweetest of all that we've won so far in the past 14, 15 months. Three-nil against a top-quality side who have beaten us the last two times. Everything is really good.\n\"If you don't have a good defence in India it's very difficult to counter the bowling we have. We sensed they don't have enough faith in the way they go about their innings.\n\"We knew it's only a matter of time, we took a couple of wickets and they crumbled quickly. We knew it wouldn't be long.\"\nEngland coach Trevor Bayliss: \"For most of the Test matches we've had one or two good days, or sessions. But when you're playing one of the best teams in the world in their home conditions, that's what you face.\n\"This game, our spinners would probably agree, they didn't hit their lengths like they did in the first three games. We tried three spinners in the first few games and that didn't work.\n\"We don't get to face the quality of spin bowlers they've got there in home conditions. The more we can come and play here, I'd like to think the next time we come here, we'd know what to expect.\"", "Now we arrive at the next big-ticket Strategic Defence and Security Review the prime minister is delivering today, and the tone could hardly be more different.\nDefence Secretary Michael Fallon and his boss are outlining what they consider to be a new and improved defence capability, not just to protect Britain more effectively but helping to defeat the so-called Islamic State and, crucially, \"projecting our values around the world\".\nAnd there's added edge to their arguments today, making their case just ten days after the terrorist outrage in Paris.\nThere are mind-boggling sums of money involved - the government is promising to spend \u00c2\u00a3178bn of taxpayers' money on new kit for the military in the coming decade: 10,000 troops in two \"strike brigades\" that will be able to respond more flexibly and quickly to threats around the world; many more jets, \"bigger and stronger\" defence forces as the defence secretary describes them.\nThey might be busy, very busy. One Cabinet minister told me we will see a \"new assertiveness across the globe\".\nThere will be more deployments of our troops they said, more interventions, more boots on the ground, not to wage war, but to help stabilise fragile states, particularly in Africa.\nTroops \"in greater mass\", will be able to be deployed around the world. This is a new and different phase where it's more likely that British soldiers might be sent to intervene in the way they currently are on the ground in Nigeria, helping the fight against Boko Haram, or as peacekeepers in Southern Sudan, potentially in Libya too.\nWhat gives all of this a greater urgency, a greater political edge is an increasing confidence among ministers that they will have the votes in the Commons to sanction British bombing in Syria.\nDavid Cameron is expected to make his case to MPs on Thursday, with a vote likely in the coming weeks. But the government's renewed vigour on defence, and its accelerating plan for Syrian strikes, both require caveats.\nOn defence, there is more money, there is a new determination, but there is still a squeeze inside the defence budget. The SNP for example claim Scotland has been \"betrayed\" over cuts to frigates that are built on the Clyde.\nThose new strike brigades won't be at full readiness until 2025. And the extra \u00c2\u00a312bn that's going to the MoD of course comes at a cost for other departments.\nEvery penny that goes there has to come from somewhere else, and the depth of the cuts elsewhere will be revealed by George Osborne on Wednesday. Welfare, the police, and support for business are all likely to be hit.\nAnd although political sentiment is shifting in the government's favour on Syria, there are very big questions that it might be impossible for the prime minister to answer in a week.\nHardest perhaps, what ground forces exist in Syria to take and hold land where IS is destroyed? Billions of pounds of new British military kit can't answer that.", "Patients were moved out of two wards at Louth's County Hospital last month over fire inspectors' concerns about the \"ageing fabric of the building\".\nThe work, which includes upgrades to alarms and fire doors, is expected to take up to three months to complete.\nLincolnshire Community Health Services NHS Trust said 25 patients had moved and may not be returning to finish their treatment at the hospital.\nCraig McLean, deputy director of operations at the trust, said: \"It may well be that the decision is taken that it's appropriate for them to finish their treatment where they are rather than disrupting them again and bringing them back.\"\nMore on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire\nThe number of beds was reduced from 50 to 16 across Manby and Carlton wards.

76% compared with 70% in 2010.\nA spokesman for Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust pointed out that as a designated cancer centre for north-west London it cared for some of the \"highest numbers of complex cancer patients in the capital with excellent patient outcomes\".\nHe said a number of improvements were being made.\nHe added: \"We have reviewed the roles of our clinical nurse specialists to guarantee they spend the optimum amount of time possible on patient-facing activities.\"\nOther London hospital NHS trusts in the bottom 10 for patient experience were Whipps Cross University, King's College, North West London, University College, Ealing, Newham University, Barking, Havering and Redbridge University and North Middlesex University.\nAs an example of patient treatment, Macmillan Cancer Support cited the experience of a 32-year-old woman being treated at a London hospital trust for recurrent Hodgkin's Lymphoma.\nShe said she had developed complications during her stem cell transplant.\nShe said: \"From the first day they promised to get a specialist to see me. Three weeks later my symptoms were worse and no doctor had come to see me.\n\"I wasn't listened to, the doctors and nurses left me in such pain that I couldn't even walk.\n\"Upon discharge from the hospital they promised an urgent referral would be sent to the specialist.  No letter was written.\"\nProfessor Kathy Pritchard-Jones, chief medical officer of London Cancer, an integrated group of NHS cancer specialists in north and north-east London, said: \"The survey reflects the fact that too often the NHS in the capital delivers a disjointed and fragmented experience for patients with cancer.\"", "Elizabeth Stokes was jailed for four-and-a half-years in 2014 for attacking John, 71, after wrongly believing he was having an affair.\nNow the order banning her from contacting him has been lifted at Gloucester Crown Court.\nMr Stokes said he had forgiven his wife and fully recovered from his injuries.\nThe pair from Cheltenham will be able to visit each other under supervision of the probation service for the next two years before possibly being allowed to live together again.\nDuring the hearing, Mr Stokes said: \"I honestly believe her when she says she is very remorseful about what happened.\n\"She realises she made a terrible mistake.\n\"We want to carry on with our marriage and our relationship as soon as possible and I honestly believe it will work and things will be better in the future.\"\nShe said: \"I had been suffering from stress for a long, long time.

It is the most serious risk rating out of five.\nOther incidents given the most serious rating include a drone coming within 20m (66ft) of a Embraer 170 jet on its approach to London City Airport above the Houses of Parliament on 13 September.\nOn the same day, a Boeing 737 had a near miss with a drone shortly after take-off from Stansted Airport in Essex.\nRegulations set by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) prohibits unmanned aircraft from flying within 50m (164ft) of any vessel, vehicle or structure that is not in the control of the person in charge of the aircraft.\nThe British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) wants the Department for Transport and the CAA to back research into the possible consequences of a collision with a passenger jet.\nFormer RAF and British Airways pilot Steve Landells warned that a drone hitting an airliner could result in an uncontrolled engine failure or a smashed cockpit windscreen.\nMr Landells, Balpa's flight safety specialist, said there was a large amount of data on the effects of bird strikes on planes, but he said specific drone research was needed because \"birds don't have a big lump of lithium battery in them\".\nAnalysis\nBy Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondent\nMany pilots think it's a matter of time before one actually strikes a plane, yet no-one has any real idea what would happen if it did.\nBalpa says it is possible a drone could smash the windscreen, showering the crew with glass, or even cause an uncontrolled engine fire which could bring down the aircraft.\nIn 2009, an airliner lost both engines coming out of New York after it hit a flock of geese. It was only the skill of the pilot, gliding the aircraft down in an emergency landing on the Hudson River, that saved everyone's life.\nBalpa says a drone strike could be even worse, because they have powerful lithium batteries on board that could start an engine fire. It's now asking the government and the safety regulator to help pay for tests to see just how serious a drone strike might be.\nPhilippa Oldham, from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, said the consequences of a drone hitting an airliner would depend on a number of factors such as the size and speed of the drone and the location of the collision.\n\"The impact potentially could be anything from nothing to a destruction of an engine,\" she said.\nPeople who fly drones close to planes could be convicted of endangering the safety of an aircraft, which has a maximum prison sentence of five years, the CAA said.\nA spokesman for the regulator urged drone users to understand that the UK has \"one of the busiest areas of airspace in the world\".\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said public safety was \"our first priority\" and it is working closely with the CAA and airline operators to \"improve our understanding and knowledge this emerging technology\".\nDrones fitted with cameras must not be flown:\nSource: Civil Aviation Authority", "Kelly went past favourite L'Ami Serge in the final strides, having earlier won the opener on Coo Star Sivola.\nWilly Twiston-Davies joined an elite list of jockeys to have ridden a winner at Royal Ascot and Cheltenham when scoring with handicap hurdler Cogry.\nMeanwhile, 50-1 shot Tour Des Champs gave trainer Samuel Drinkwater a winner with his first runner at the track.\nWhisper beat Clan Des Obeaux to land the Dipper Novices' Chase.\nKelly - riding for her stepfather, trainer Nick Williams - has called for female riders to be given more opportunities.\nShe had previously described her season as \"pants\" with only three winners before these two victories at Cheltenham\n\"It's been a tough season and I'm just glad we've come here today and the hard work of everyone has paid off,\" she said after 16-1 shot Agrapart defeated L'ami Serge, ridden by Daryl Jacob, to seal a 92.5-1 double.\nFive professional female jump jockeys enjoyed wins around the country on New Year's Day- Kelly joined by Lucy Alexander, Lucy Gardner, Megan Carberry and Bridget Andrews.\nTwiston-Davies teamed up with his trainer father Nigel for his first win over the jumps at Cheltenham, six months after partnering Primitivo to victory at Flat racing's blue riband Ascot meeting.\n\"It's really really special,\" said the 6ft tall jockey, who grew up 12 miles from the course.\nTour Des Champs was the second winner of a fledgling career for ex-amateur jockey Drinkwater, who has a stable of nine horses.\n\"I've been training about a month and that's my sixth runner.

The first very well-judged, the second a demonstration of genuine strength in the saddle.", "But now one man has successfully claimed back the cost of his time from a firm which called him when he had specifically asked them not to.\nRichard Herman from Middlesex felt like he was being hounded by calls and texts from companies telling him they could help him claim compensation after an accident or claim back money spent on mis-sold payment protection insurance, or PPI as it's known.\nHe has not had an accident and he has never taken out PPI.\nAnd he is also registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), which should stop unwanted sales calls.\nSo he decided to take action.\nBack in July, Mr Herman answered a call from an overseas call centre inviting him to make a PPI claim, he decided to stay on the line.\nHe answered the caller's questions until he was eventually passed through to a UK operation, called PPI Claimline, and told them he wanted to be taken off their sales list.\n\"I said to them, you need to stop calling me and, I said, if you keep calling me, I'll charge you \u00a310 a minute for my time to be talking to you,\" Mr Herman said, speaking to Radio 4's Money Box programme.\n\"I presumed that would be the end of it, but to my astonishment they called me again.\"\nDuring the second call - which came only two days later - Mr Herman waited 19 and a half minutes to be put through to the UK operation, to confirm that it was the same company as before, and to explain that he was now charging for his time.\nSo, when he got off the phone, he sent an invoice for \u00a3195 to PPI Claimline.\nListen to the full report on Money Box on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday, 27 October at 12.00 BST.\nListen again via the Radio 4 website\nDownload the Money Box podcast\nGot a story? Contact the Money Box team\nAt first, he got no response. So Mr Herman sent the invoice again, this time by recorded delivery. PPI Claimline then wrote to him.\nThe company said it itself did not cold call, but it purchased introductions from other marketing companies including AAC, a UK company based in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, which uses the overseas call centre that had first called Mr Herman and passed him on to PPI Claimline.\nThe company said there was no record of Mr Herman's number in its database or that of any of its partner companies.\nBut Mr Herman had recorded the phone calls. So, stepping up his consumer assertiveness another gear, he filed a case in the small claims court.\nAnd that seemed to do the trick and the case was settled before it went to court.\nAAC, the company which had called Mr Herman on behalf of PPI Claimline, paid him \u00a3195 for his time and electricity, as well as his \u00a325 court costs.\nIt has been a cathartic experience for Mr Herman:\n\"It cheered me up to think that actually instead of being the victim of these calls I can actually defend myself against them to put the boot onto the other foot.\"\nBoth PPI Claimline and AAC declined to be interviewed by the BBC, but issued statements saying they are sorry that Mr Herman was called after he had asked for the calls to stop.\nThey say they only contact people who have opted in to receiving marketing calls, and they say Mr Herman had done so via a website he visited, which requires you to tick or untick a box to agree to be contacted by other companies. Mr Herman says he has not.\nBut even if he had, AAC is still breaking the law in this case, according to John Mitchison from the Telephone Preference Service.\n\"If Mr Herman had given specific consent for a named company to contact him, then that would have overridden TPS, but it would have to have been as blatant as that.\n\"General third party opt-in does not override TPS. The company should have been screening against TPS. It's a legal requirement to do that.\"\nIf you are registered with the TPS, and receive a cold call, you can complain to the TPS who will do a first round of investigations and pass the company's details on to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).\nBut the ICO has not been doing enough to stop rogue companies, according to Mr Mitchison:\n\"They haven't made any serious enforcement action for quite some time. At the beginning of this year, the ICO were given increased powers.\n\"They can now enforce a civil monetary penalty of \u00a3500,000, but they haven't done anything in the area of the TPS as yet.\n\"It's very frustrating. We obviously receive a huge number of complaints each month and we receive telephone calls from people that are being deluged by this type of call - particularly in the area of PPI and accident claims.\"\nOfcom figures show that complaints about cold calls trebled in the first half of this year, with nearly 10,000 complaints lodged in July alone.\nBut the ICO is taking the problem of nuisance calls seriously according to its director of operations, Simon Entwhistle.\n\"In the past five or six years, we've taken action against 19 different companies for making calls that breach the electronic communications regulations,\" he said.\n\"The power to fine has only been in force for the last year. We have issued our first notice of intent to fine someone and the fines are totalling over \u00a3250,000.\n\"That's actually for people who've been sending spam texts, but these people don't just send one medium\u2026they send several different mediums.\"\nAnd what does he think of Mr Herman's success in taking matters into his own hands?\n\"It raised a wry smile. I think the people that make these calls are a nuisance and it's really good to see the public joining in the fight back against them.\"\nAnd other sales companies would probably do well to take Mr Herman's details off their databases, because he's ready for their call:\n\"I continue to receive further telemarketing calls, albeit from other companies. And I say to them every time now, that I will charge them \u00a310 a minute if they call again.\n\"I would like to think that it will help other people because every friend and family member I speak to all feels very under the cosh of these telemarketing companies.\"\nAAC of Bishop's Stortford is not connected to AAC Direct of Cardiff.\nListen to the full report on Money Box on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday, 27 October at  Listen again via the Radio 4 website or the Money Box download.", "St Peter's Hospice has been awarded \u00c2\u00a315,000 from a programme financed by the St James's Place Foundation.\nJulia Di Castiglione, from the charity, said the grant meant it could continue to help seriously ill people live in comfort until they die.\n\"It will also enable us to provide support for their family and friends,\" she said.\n\"Last year our team cared for over 350 patients at home - it's great that we will be able to help even more people this year.\"", "Three-year-old Hari Hi Way was being treated by vets at the zoo after falling ill with a viral infection.\nDespite their efforts, the bull calf elephant died late on Tuesday afternoon.

We know that ovarian tissue transplantation works for older women, but we've never known if we could take tissue from a child, freeze it and make it work again.\"\nDoctors say it will give hope to many other girls and young women who risk losing the chance of motherhood as a result of treatment for cancer, blood or immune disorders.\nMoaza Al Matrooshi, who is from Dubai, was born with beta thalassaemia, an inherited blood disorder that is fatal if untreated.\nShe needed chemotherapy, which damages the ovaries, before receiving a bone marrow transplant from her brother at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London.\nSo, prior to treatment, when she was nine years old, she had her right ovary removed in an operation in Leeds, where the tissue was frozen.\nFragments of her ovarian tissue were mixed with cryo-protective agents and slowly reduced in temperature to minus 196C, before being stored under liquid nitrogen.\nLast year, surgeons in Denmark transplanted five slivers of the ovarian tissue back into her body - four were stitched on to her failed left ovary and one on to the side of her uterus.\nMoaza had been going through the menopause.  But after the transplant, her hormone levels began returning to normal, she began ovulating and her fertility was restored.\nIn order to maximise the chances of having a child, Moaza and her husband Ahmed underwent IVF treatment.\nFrom the eight eggs that were collected, three embryos were produced, two of which were implanted earlier this year.\nMoaza said: \"I always believed that I would be a mum and that I would have a baby.\n\"I didn't stop hoping and now I have this baby - it is a perfect feeling.\"\nShe also thanked her mother, whose idea it was to save her young daughter's ovarian tissue so that she might be able to have a family in the future.\nDr Sara Matthews, who conducted the fertility treatment, said: \"Within three months of re-implanting her ovarian tissue, Moaza went from being menopausal to having regular periods again.\n\"She basically became a normal woman in her 20s with normal ovary function.\"\nProf Helen Picton, who leads the division of reproduction and early development at the University of Leeds, carried out the ovary freezing.\nShe told me: \"This is incredibly encouraging. Moaza is a pioneer and was one of the first patients we helped back in 2001, before any baby had been born from ovary tissue preservation.\n\"Worldwide more than 60 babies have been born from women who had their fertility restored, but Moaza is the first case from pre-pubertal freezing and the first from a patient who had treatment for beta thalassaemia.\"\nResearchers in Leeds have been at the forefront of ovarian tissue freezing.\nIn 1999 scientists from Leeds were instrumental in performing the world's first transplant of frozen ovarian tissue.\nProf Picton said that in Europe alone, several thousand girls and young women now had frozen ovarian tissue in storage.\nThis is usually done prior to patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation treatment, both of which damage fertility.\nMoaza still has one embryo in storage as well as two remaining pieces of ovarian tissue.\nShe told me she definitely plans to have another baby in the future.\nEarlier this year a cancer patient from Edinburgh became the first UK woman to give birth following a transplant of her frozen ovary tissue.\nThe mother, who conceived naturally, wished to remain anonymous.\nLast year a woman in Belgium gave birth using ovarian tissue frozen when she was 13.\nUnlike Moaza, she had begun going through puberty when her ovary was removed.\nThe first woman in the world to give birth following the transplantation of her own ovarian tissue was in Belgium in 2004.", "The payments company is selecting 50 small companies in the US to receive $10,000 if they only use cards.\nThe companies have to bid for the money by explaining how going cashless would affect them, their staff and customers.\nHowever, the idea has been criticised by consumer groups, who say cash is still vital for many people.\n\"It is easy to categorise it as a bribe, but ultimately they are incentivising companies to do away with cash, and that's not the job of people like Visa,\" said James Daley of consumer group Fairer Finance.\nIn any case, the offer could be of limited appeal to many retailers, who have to pay fees every time a customer uses a debit or credit card.\nEven though interchange fees, as they are called, have been capped by the EU, retailers still pay an average of 16p on each credit card transaction, and 5.5p on each debit card.\nIn total UK retailers still paid \u00c2\u00a3800m in such fees last year, charges that have been criticised by the British Retail Consortium (BRC).\nCards have already overtaken cash for retail payments, according to figures for last year from the BRC.\nBut banks and card companies should not be driving that move, Mr Daley said.\n\"In 50 years it seems unlikely that most of us will be using cash. But banks need to let evolution follow its natural course, rather than accelerating it,\" he told the BBC.\n\"As a responsible society we need to look after vulnerable customers who rely on cash.\"\nLast month Victoria Cleland, the Bank of England's chief cashier, said that 2.7 million people in the UK rely almost entirely on cash - that's 5% of adults.\nNevertheless at least one cafe in London - Browns of Brockley -has already gone cashless.\nIn a statement, Visa said that following the launch of the scheme in the US, \"we hope to bring similar cashless initiatives to other countries, including the UK\".\n\"At this time, we do not have a firm plan on when such an initiative would be available in the UK.\"\nIn June this year, Visa chief executive Al Kelly told investors that the company was \"focused on putting cash out of business\".\n\"The number one growth lever [for the company] is the conversion of cheque and cash to digital and electronic payments.\"", "The health secretary has ordered a review into the deaths of at least five babies at the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust.\nA law firm says it has 27 open cases into claims that mistakes at the trust led to brain injuries at birth.\nThe trust said the sums already paid out did not reflect current services.\nA medical negligence charity says the trust is an \"outlier\" in terms of avoidable harm and has demanded a full inquiry.\n'Doctors ignored me - my girls are gone'\nCluster of baby deaths probe ordered\nTrust 'failed to investigate baby death'\nShrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust has been the focus of intense scrutiny since the BBC revealed last month that Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt had ordered a review into how the trust has investigated the deaths of babies caused by errors in labour.\nThere have been at least seven avoidable deaths at the trust between September 2014 and May 2016.\nFailures to properly monitor and analyse the foetal heart rate - CTG traces - contributed to five of the deaths.\nBut the problems with CTG monitoring at the trust go back much further, according to a document the BBC has seen.\nLiving with a child born with brain injuries is a daily struggle for the Morris family.\nBeth and Olivia are identical twins born at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital in 2005.\nBeth is a happy, healthy 11-year-old, with friends and interests common to many young girls.\nBut a failure to promptly deliver her sister, as well as failing to spot she was in distress due to an error in properly monitoring her heart rate, means Olivia suffered a brain injury.\nShe has cerebral palsy - she struggles to walk, cannot talk and needs to be fed through a tube as she cannot swallow.\nThe trust has admitted liability.\n\"Our family life is not the same as it should be,\" said their mother Sharon Morris.\n\"Olivia can see Beth doing all the things that she wants to do.\n\"Beth has friends that she goes off and does various things with. Olivia doesn't have any friends - Olivia's best friend is her sister.\"\n\"She'll always live at home with us for the rest of her life.  And she'll always have care for the rest of her life as well - she'll never live independently.\"\nIn July 2015, Dr Adam Gornall, an obstetrician at the trust, attended a maternity networking event in Manchester organised by the NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA), now NHS Resolution.\nThe discussion was aimed at improving safety in maternity units in England and Dr Gornall revealed the scale of the problem the trust was facing in relation to foetal heart monitoring.\nHe told the meeting the trust had received one compensation claim for \u00a34.4m relating to CTG interpretation after a child had been born with cerebral palsy.\nTwo other claims totalling nearly \u00a3150,000 were \"directly related to the interpretation of CTGs\" and they had received other claims \"in which CTG interpretation was partially involved\".\nThe trust was given \u00a3183,000 in May 2015 by the NHSLA to improve its CTG performance.\nDr Gornall told the meeting the money would be spent on new CTG equipment, a different approach to monitoring, e-learning, improved trained and changing behaviour.\nHowever, in the five months following the July 2015 meeting, the BBC has learned that CTG errors at birth contributed to the deaths of three babies - one was still-born, one died within days, and a third died aged just four months.\nAn analysis the BBC has done of NHSLA figures shows in the past decade the trust has paid out nearly \u00a325m in compensation and legal fees for maternity errors, when regulators told the trust to improve, with payments made for brain injuries being the single largest category.\nBrain injuries at birth can occur for a number of reasons, including a failure to ensure oxygen gets to the baby's brain or a physical injury to the child's head - for instance the incorrect use of forceps during delivery.\nFigures provided to the BBC by medical negligence lawyers Lanyon Bowdler in Shrewsbury show they have 27 open investigations into allegations of brain injuries caused to babies at birth as a result of mistakes at the Shrewsbury and Telford trust since 2005.\nSolicitor Beth Harrison said the number of families coming forward alleging errors is increasing, with 15 cases being opened in the past three years.\n\"We've seen a real increase in the number of people approaching us and cases that we've taken on.  I think it's down to deterioration in the service and the standard of care.  And people are also more aware that they can bring claims when things go wrong.\n\"Repeatedly we are seeing the same errors - failures in relation to heart trace monitoring and realising the baby is in distress, delays in taking women for an emergency caesarean and issues with the wrong use of forceps.\"\nThe firm says since the recent BBC reports, nine new families have contacted them alleging errors in labour at the trust - four say their child died, four say their child was born with a brain injury, while one is alleging the trust caused the death of a mother.\nCompensation for brain injuries can run into millions of pounds due to the ongoing, sometimes lifetime needs of the victims.\nThe Shrewsbury and Telford trust's maternity department has paid out \u00a324.3 million in compensation and legal fees since 2007, according to official NHS figures.\nThe money relates to at least 34 settled claims, including 14 brain injuries, eight for deaths of babies, one mother's death and 11 other mistakes, including babies born with physical injuries due to errors in labour.\nThe trust points out that it can take 'many years for claims to be brought and resolved' after the incidents occur.\nThe total compensation figure is among the highest paid out by comparable obstetrics units - based on the number of deliveries and type of unit as categorised by researchers at the official MBRRACE-UK study into perinatal deaths - over the past decade.\nTaken alongside the number of avoidable deaths at the trust, the charity Action against Medical Accidents (AVMA) has added to calls for a much wider inquiry into the trust.\n\"These figures are very worrying,\" the charity's chief executive Peter Walsh said.\n\"It seems to me there should be a fully independent and in-depth investigation into what has been going on and the root causes of the lapses in patient safety that have been causing such terrible harm.\n\"What has been arranged so far is nowhere near enough. The new Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch should be called in to get to the bottom of the problems at this trust.\"\nIn a statement, the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said it would not comment in detail in case it prejudiced the ongoing review into maternity services.\nHowever, the trust said: \"Claims can be and frequently are brought and resolved many years after incidents occur.\n\"Taking this into account, along with the further period taken up by the litigation process itself, which can last a number of years, the sums paid out in recent years offer little insight into the maternity services provided by the Trust since 2007.\n\"Since 2007, NHS Resolution has received 50 claims for compensation relating to maternity on behalf of the Trust.\n\"However, the majority of these claims are in connection with incidents which happened before 2007.\n\"Of these 50 claims, only one claim for brain injury occurred after 2007.\"\nSign-up to get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning", "Their study, in Science Translation Medicine, showed caffeine was more than just a stimulant and actually slowed down the body's internal clock.\nA double espresso three hours before bedtime delayed the production of the sleep hormone melatonin by about 40 minutes, making it harder to nod off.\nExperts said our own actions had a huge influence on sleep and the body clock.\nOne of the researchers, Dr John O'Neill, from the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, told the BBC News website: \"If you're tired and having a coffee at night to stay awake, then that is a bad idea, you'll find it harder to go to sleep and get enough sleep.\"\nIn his half of the study, cells grown in a dish were exposed to caffeine to work out how it changed their ability to keep time.\nIt showed the drug was able to alter the chemical clocks ticking away in every cell of the human body.\nMeanwhile, five people at the University of Colorado Boulder, in the US, were locked in a sleep laboratory for 50 days.\nAnd as light exposure is the main way we normally control our body clock, they spent most of their incarceration in very dim light.\nIn a series of experiments over the month and a half, the scientists showed that an evening dose of caffeine slowed the body clock by 40 minutes.\nIt had roughly half the impact of three hours of bright light at bedtime.\nDr O'Neill said it would be \"complete speculation\" to set a cut-off time for drinking caffeine in the evening but he personally never drank coffee after 17:00.\nHe said the findings may help treat some sleep disorders and people who naturally woke up too early - known as larks - to help keep them in sync with the rest of the world.\n\"It could be useful with jet lag if you are flying east to west where taking caffeine at the right time of day might speed up the time it takes to overcome jet lag,\" he added.\nProf Derk-Jan Dijk, from the University of Surrey, told the BBC: \"Individuals differ in their sensitivity to caffeine, and if coffee drinkers experience problems with falling asleep, they may try to avoid drinking coffee in the afternoon and evening.\"\nHe added that people \"too often\" thought they were a \"slave\" to their body clocks and programmed to wake up early or late.\n\"These and other data clearly indicate that we can to some extent modify these rhythms and that part of the reason why we sleep so late relates to factors such as caffeine intake and the exposure to artificial light in the evening,\" he said.", "In a Freedom of Information request, police confirmed the letters were distributed to members of the public.\nThe estate houses the Queen's residence and Anmer Hall, home to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\nOne letter said the estate \"would take intrusions into their privacy, and that of their guests, seriously\".\nNorfolk Police handed out 13 letters during 2014 and 36 up to the end of November 2015.\nIt is not known if the letters were distributed for trespass or harassment, as Norfolk Police could not specify the exact reasons due to the manpower costs involved.\nThey have been given to photographers and media crews in the area.\nAn example of a letter seen by the BBC reminds people that Sandringham is a private estate.\n\"The understandable interest to film and photograph the Royal Family needs to be balanced with their rights to a private family life.\n\"Whilst in residence on the estate, members of the Royal Family and their guests have more than a reasonable expectation of privacy,\" said the letter.\nThe media are encouraged to speak to royal communications should they wish to broadcast or photograph on the estate, it adds.\nAnmer Hall, a Georgian mansion, is about two miles (3km) east of the Queen's residence.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child, Prince George started attending the local Westacre Montessori nursery close to their family home in Anmer this month, generating much media interest.\nNotices warning the media not to harass the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also handed out by Norfolk Police in May, after the birth of Princess Charlotte.", "Elfyn Llwyd asks if it was appropriate that Nikki Holland was given the job while a report into an investigation she led has not yet been published.\nIt looked at South Wales Police's role in one of Britain's worst miscarriages of justice.\nThe force said her work on it ended two years before she applied for the post.\nThree men from Cardiff spent a decade in jail after being wrongly convicted of killing newsagent Phillip Saunders in the Canton area of the city in 1987.\nThe Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) set-up Operation Resolute in 2010 in response to claims from one of the wrongly convicted men that evidence was fabricated by a South Wales Police officer.\nA year later, Nikki Holland, then a detective superintendent with Merseyside Police, was selected by the IPCC to take over the investigation, which has now been completed.\nControl over publication of the operation's report lies with South Wales Police.\nIn February, the force said it would publish the report \"in as much detail as possible\" once it had been signed off by the IPCC.\nIt will be submitted for sign-off in the next few weeks.\nPlaid Cymru MP Mr Llwyd said appointing Ms Holland as assistant chief constable before publishing the report was a \"curious situation\" that requires explanation.\nHe says he is writing to the Home Secretary to ask whether Ms Holland's appointment was appropriate.\nHe said there was \"something odd\" that a person who led a very far-reaching and important report into a miscarriage of justice  by South Wales Police suddenly becomes one of its most senior officers before its publication.\n\"Secondly, I've asked the Home Secretary...to ensure the report is published fully and urgently or alternatively that she can explain fully and urgently what is the true reason for any further delay,\" he said.\nIn 2009, Ms Holland was promoted to superintendent at Merseyside Police and later began working on overseeing the operation.\nSouth Wales Police deputy chief constable Matt Jukes said: \"Following a thorough and robust investigation, this work was completed in April 2012 around two years before Ms Holland applied for her current position\".\nNewsagent Mr Saunders died after being hit over the head and robbed outside his home.\nThree men -

With the Trump administration being buffeted by the Jeff Sessions political death watch, the ongoing multi-prong investigation into the Trump campaign, the healthcare drama in the Senate and the impending Russian sanctions bill, perhaps the administration decided this was a good time to change the subject and rally conservative forces to his side.\nRepublicans have long used cultural issues as a wedge to divide Democrats and energise evangelicals. As one White House insider acknowledged, this is straight out of that playbook. While Mr Trump campaigned as sympathetic to LGBT rights, he needs the traditional religious conservatives to stay loyal to him now, more than ever.\nHis populist supporters won't consider this a top issue, but the president needs more than just his die-hard loyalists in his corner, particularly if he's going to stoke intraparty discord by continuing to feud with Mr Sessions.\nThe president's action will create a furore among liberals and the media commentators whose disdain for the current administration is not a new development. This is a fight the White House will welcome.\nThe independent Rand Corporation estimated in 2016 that 2,450 of the 1.2 million active-duty service members are transgender, though some campaigners put the figure higher.\nThe Obama administration's move to allow transgender people in the military to serve openly was announced in June 2016 by then Defence Secretary Ash Carter.\nThe policy included a provision for the military to provide medical help for service members wanting to change gender.\nTransgender people would be permitted to join the services, so long as they could demonstrate they had been stable in their new gender for at least 18 months.\nThis was meant to come into effect on 1 July 2017 but the Trump administration delayed it by a further six months. The Pentagon said the five branches of the military needed more time to \"review their accession plans and provide input on the impact to the readiness and lethality of our forces\".\nWhile Mr Trump's decision concerns transgender military personnel, the US military's ban on openly gay and lesbian servicemen and women - known as \"Don't ask don't tell\" - was lifted in 2011.\nDelays leave transgender military in limbo\nLGBTQ campaign group, GLAAD, called Mr Trump's move \"a direct attack on transgender Americans\".\nGeorge Takei, equality campaigner and the actor who played Mr Sulu in Star Trek, accused the president of cruelty and pettiness.\nAaron Belkin, director of the Palm Centre, a leading think-tank which studies gender and sexuality in the military, told the BBC that Mr Trump's decision would force transgender troops to in effect live as gays and lesbians did under \"Don't ask, don't tell\".\nFormer Defence Secretary Carter released a critical statement: \"To choose service members on other grounds than military qualifications is social policy and has no place in our military. There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably.\"\nChairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Republican John McCain, said major policy announcements should not be made via Twitter and continued:\n\"The statement was unclear. The Department of Defense has already decided to allow currently-serving transgender individuals to stay in the military, and many are serving honorably today.\nAny American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving.\"\nTrump revokes transgender toilet rules\nRepublican opponents of transgender people serving in the military include Vicky Hartzler, a congresswoman from Missouri, who wants transgender service members honourably discharged.\nSome oppose the military having to bear medical costs associated with transgender recruits, such as gender reassignment.\nTrump supporter and political commentator Scott Presler is among those who disagree with the military carrying the cost of such interventions.\nWhile disagreeing with the ban, he added that \"generals know more about war than I do.\n\"I am cognizant that they understand what it takes to go to war... I don't think this is an attack on the LGBT community.\n\"I'm mixed, but I have confidence in the guidance that President Trump is receiving,\" he said. \"I don't think for a second he's prejudiced.\"", "The 200ft (61m) chimney was built in the 1950s on top of an 11-storey reprocessing plant on the nuclear site.\nIt no longer meets modern design standards and needs to be demolished, but owing to its location, the use of explosives has had to be ruled out.\nInstead, a platform will be constructed and steeplejacks will dismantle the huge structure bit by bit from the top.\nThey will have to remove 600 tonnes of concrete and more than 25 tonnes of stainless steel.\nMatthew Hodgson, the project manager, said: \"The job of bringing down the stack is going to be a delicate operation to ensure 100% safety of all personnel and surrounding nuclear plants.\n\"Obviously conventional demolition using explosives is not feasible, therefore we will use an ingenious self-climbing platform which will bring the chimney down bit by bit in a controlled manner.\n\"A mini-replica of the tapered chimney will be built to test the methodology as the diameter of the chimney increases the lower you go down, so the platform will correspondingly have to increase in size.\n\"A specialist diamond wire cutting system will be used to remove large sections of the concrete structure and the internal metal flue.\n\"All of which will have to be lowered to the base of the stack for monitoring before disposal.\"\nSteve Slater, head of decommissioning, said: \"It's going to be out with the old and in with the new, with the new Separation Area Ventilation (SAV) stack taking over.\n\"Work to construct that new replacement stack is continuing.\"\nThe first phase of the work, to install an industrial lift and a roof bridge structure, allowing access to the base of the chimney, is about to begin.", "Wisconsin teenager Joshua Furlano decided to do something about it. As a project for high school, he organised an e-waste drive with a nearby recycling company in his hometown, West Salem, and raised nearly $1,000 (\u00c2\u00a3671) for a local charity.\n\"Many people don't know what to do with the old electronics. The event prevents people from throwing the old electronics in landfills but instead recycling them properly,\" says Mr Furlano, who gathered up over 6,000lbs (2,720kg) worth of e-waste.\n\"The turnout for the event was a bit of a surprise. I [didn't] have much advertising before so I did not believe there would be a large turnout. From the start of the event I already had three to four cars lined up in the parking lot,\" he adds.\nThe success of grassroots events like this highlights the fact that many of us are still unsure what to do with our old devices.\nAccording to the UN, the world produced 50 million tons of electronic waste in 2012. That's an average of 15lbs (6.8kg) per person.\nThe constant pressure to upgrade smartphones to the newest model leaves countless older devices on the scrap heap.  Here a motley crew of toxins including lead, mercury, cadmium, and barium can leach from electronic components into  the environment.\nAdd the proliferation of fitness trackers, tablets and wearables like the Apple Watch, and we're wearing and carrying more electronics than ever before - all of which will one day be obsolete.\nThis has inevitably led to the rise of the e-waste management industry. A report earlier this year from Allied Market Research predicts it will be worth $49.4bn by 2020.\nMajor tech companies are doing their bit too. Apple is now accepting non-iPhones like Android and Windows Phone devices to its reuse and recycle program in the US, Canada, UK, France, Italy, and Germany.\nOther big companies offering a similar scheme include Kyocera, which even provides free shipping labels.\nSeveral companies and start-ups have spotted an opportunity.\nIndia's BinBag describes itself as the Uber of recycling.\nThe Bangalore-based start-up has been in operation for just over six months and has already gathered two tons of e-waste, according to founder and chief executive Achitra Borgohain.\n\"We have a web platform where people that want to dispose of their waste can log in and get picked up\" says Mr Borgohain.\n\"We typically get stuff like old PCs, old cell phones.\"\nUnlike other companies, BinBag doesn't actually own any recycling plants. Mr Borgohain say it is \"only solving the last mile\" for the customer by connecting them with recyclers.\nE-waste, and waste disposal in general in India has been a particular problem for government, which is drafting new rules to prevent dumping on the streets.\nThere is also the issue of informal recyclers - illegal businesses with low-paid workers, collecting electronics to break down and sell for parts. Safety precautions to protect workers are often non-existent, as are measures to prevent pollution.\nBinBag's aim is to link people up with legitimate recyclers through its notification system.\nWhen a user has something to throw away, a nearby waste collector will receive a notification with details on where to pick it up, ensuring the electronics are recycled safely.\nThe start-up is only active in Bangalore but has plans to expand to four or five cities in the next year. It also runs recycling awareness events at schools.\nBinBag provides its services mainly to individuals but is keen to attract small businesses in the future.\n\"They are also the ones struggling to dispose their waste.\"\nMobile Monster in Melbourne in Australia says it wants to help consumers who don't know how to get rid of their old phones.\nThe Victoria state government recently banned e-waste from landfills to encourage more recycling.\n\"We wanted to make it as easy for people as possible,\" says Tim Duggal, managing director of the company, which ships the goods off to a recycling plant. Much like BinBag, the service is a sort of middle man.\nPeople can drop off their devices to the company's location or mail them in and receive a small fee in return.\n\"They can even send in really old phones, even if they're not worth any money, and we also recycle them and keep them out of landfills,\" says Mr Duggal.\n\"We've seen a growth of about 20% to 30% each year in the number of handsets coming in. Typically when the [new] iPhone comes out, the numbers can go up to ten times.\"\nOne way to make the general public aware of how to recycle their electronics is by partnering with another company.\nCanadian pizza chain Pizza Pizza runs its electronics donation scheme every April for Earth Month, where consumers can trade in devices for a free slice.\n\"Last year throughout the month we collected and kept nearly 5,300 devices out of landfills,\" says Pat Finelli, chief marketing officer of Pizza Pizza, who says the scheme is on track to surpass last year's milestone.\nThe chain has partnered with Ontario-based firm Greentec, which runs e-waste collection and recycling services.\n\"We would separate what we feel would be suitable for reuse or have some type of reuse component in the item,\" explains chief executive Tony Perrotta on the process.\n\"So for example if we had a laptop that didn't power up or something that didn't work on it but the screen was good, not cracked or broken, then for us that would be a suitable item that we could probably repair and get it back into working condition and resell that product.\"\nGreentec receives a lot of phones that are beyond repair but also gets many that aren't too old and can easily be resold.\n\"An old iPhone 4, there's still a good market for here,\" he says. Anything older needs to be dismantled for its metals and plastics, and sent on to smelters and other recycling plants.\n\"Even in the developing countries, they're after the smartphones,\" says Mr Perrotta.", "Lance Sgt Matthew Lawson, 37, who had just shared an early Valentine's meal with his wife in Kingston-upon-Thames, saw the teenager running towards them with police in hot pursuit.\nMr Lawson, from Derby, stuck out his foot and tripped the man up.\nFootage of the incident has been viewed thousands of times online.\nPolice in Kingston said he was a \"legend\".\nLance Sgt Lawson is based at Wellington Barracks beside Buckingham Palace.

It's the first Saturday night of 1975, the Welsh selectors - known as the Big Five, had just seen the Probables hammer the Possibles in a final trial at the Arms Park.\nThey retired to a room on the first floor of the hotel with a message that the team for the opening match of the Five Nations will be announced at 7.45 pm.\nAlong with four other reporters I waited below in the foyer - upstairs and downstairs, we knew our place.\nIt was gone nine o'clock before the selectors invited us into their inner sanctum where they named the team to play France in Paris.\nIt contained no fewer than six new caps, among them Aberavon's outside-half John Bevan.\nThey also named another uncapped fly-half among the replacements, a 20-year-old from Swansea called David Richards.\nNo Phil Bennett? Was he injured? No.\nWas he ill? No.\nSo he'd been dropped.\nThe Big Five could be notoriously uncommunicative when it suited them and it suited them that Saturday night. And Bennett had not played in the trial.\nOnly a few months earlier the same Phil Bennett had come home from the greatest of all British and Irish Lions' tours, celebrated as the ringmaster of their unbeaten safari throughout South Africa.\nSo he had just gone from being the number one number 10 in Europe to the number three number 10 in Wales, at best. It beggared belief.\nThere was only one person to speak to - Phil Bennett. I rang him, apologised for bothering him so late and asked for his reaction to the news. And he said: \"What news?\"\nI'd assumed that the Big Five had at least afforded him the basic courtesy of a 'phone call.\nWhat a way to treat amateur players giving up their time and not getting a bean for it. But the selectors took a dim view of those who they suspected of pulling out of trial matches and clearly something had happened that made them teach young Bennett a lesson.\nWales went to Paris, won a famous victory and Bevan had a blinder. They duly beat England next up in Cardiff, as they invariably did in those days and then, as now the third round took them to Edinburgh.\nBennett was back in the squad, replacing an injured Richards on the bench, resigned to sitting the match out before fate took a hand.\nBevan's dislocated shoulder brought Bennett back even if it was for a game he had good reason to forget.\nScotland's captain, Iain Mclauchlan, the mighty mouse, vowed to give Wales hell. He kept his word and the Scots won 12-10 despite Wales scoring the game's only try, from their openside flanker Trevor Evans.\nBut that has gone down in the history book for another reason, thanks to the support from Wales.\nAn estimated 40,000 had made the biennial pilgrimage north, most of them by road with many stops along the way.\nI had never seen anything like it before, nor since. From my hotel room at one end of Princes Street, all I saw was a swarming sea of red stretching all the way down towards the Scott monument as far as the eye could see.\nThe crowd was so vast that the Lothian Police estimated it at 104,000, then the biggest for any rugby international anywhere.

genetic mutation.\nAccording to this new analysis, it first appeared in horses in York about AD850.\nVikings took these horses to Iceland, and the trait spread globally.\nHorses have three essential speeds:\nHowever, a four-beat rhythm, where the horse moves both legs on the same side at the same time has long been a prized feature of some breeds.\nCalled an ambling gait, the step produces a much smoother ride, particularly over longer distances or rough terrain.\nIt is as comfortable as a walk but the horse goes as fast as a trot.\nIn 2012, researchers examined Icelandic horses, and discovered that a single mutation in a gene involved in the movement of limbs was responsible for this ambling ability.\nIn this new study, scientists extended their search for the origins of this variation of the DMRT3 gene by examining genetic material from 90 horses, some dating back before 3500BC.\nThe earliest examples they found were in samples from York dating between AD850 and AD900, when the area was being raided and temporarily settled by Vikings.\n\"The first occurrence of this mutation was in two samples from medieval England from the York Archaeological Collection,\" said one of the authors, Dr Arne Ludwig, from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research.\n\"It is unlikely that it was present before, especially not in high frequency, because this is a big advantage, this specific movement of the horses.\"\nThe more comfortable ride offered by these horses would have made them extremely valuable.\nWithin a few decades, they had turned up in Iceland, probably brought there by Vikings.\nThe rough Icelandic territory with few roads was a good environment to show off the abilities of these foreign horses and their unusual stepping action.\nThe locals liked what they saw, and the English imports were rapidly crossbred with the local horse population.\n\"It looks like the Vikings discovered the advantage of this mutation, and they had the benefit that Iceland had a small population of horses, and it is much easier to fix a trait in a small population than in a population with a huge number of horses,\" said Dr Ludwig.\nThe mutation is now found in many breeds and many different ambling styles exist.\nEarlier work has also shown the trait is key to the racing performance of trotting horses.\nThe study has been welcomed by others in this field.\n\"It adds significantly to our understanding of the domestication of the horse and especially the role of selection in development of horse breeds beginning over 1,000 years ago,\" said Prof Ernest Bailey, from the University of Kentucky, who was not connected to the study.\n\"The origin of the DMRT3 variant was not widespread before AD900, and the first detection was among horses in the British Isles, with a relatively recent point of origin.\n\"It was highly selected once recognised, as demonstrated by the rapid increase in the presence of the gene after AD1000.\"\nWhile the researchers cannot rule out the possibility that ambling horses were also present in other parts of the world, they believe it is unlikely.\nThe authors point out that trade was a major element of Viking society, as well as their fearsome reputation for raiding.\nThey believe this is the most likely route by which the horses were introduced into Asia and the Middle East.\n\"They fixed the mutation in their stock there in Iceland, and then they have distributed it via trade right around Europe and Asia.\" said Dr Ludwig.\nThe study has been published in the journal, Current Biology.\nFollow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathBBC and on Facebook.", "Following last month's storms, a section of the A591 was closed between Dunmail Raise, north of Grasmere, and Thirlmere.\nSome bus

But that seems to be of little concern to the Tories.\"\nShe added: \"No matter what the court decides, I want to make this crystal clear - I intend to make sure the Scottish Parliament has the chance to vote on the question of triggering Article 50.\n\"If the UK government don't start showing Scotland some respect, I'll make sure that people across Scotland have the chance to choose our own future before the Tories drag us off an economic cliff-edge.\"\nThe Supreme Court case followed an appeal against an earlier High Court rejection of the UK government's argument that it already has the powers to trigger Article 50.\nCampaigners say parliament must be consulted before the government does so - although Labour has already said it would not vote against Article 50.\nThe Scottish government intervened in the Supreme Court case, with the country's Lord Advocate arguing that MSPs should also be consulted before Article 50 is invoked.\nOn Sunday, the Scottish government's Brexit minister, Michael Russell, said the SNP's 54 MPs would definitely vote against Article 50.\nMeanwhile, a group of MSPs has travelled to Brussels to gauge support for Scotland keeping some form of connection with both the European Union and the single market.\nMembers of Holyrood's European Committee said their talks would centre on what can be done to mitigate the impact of leaving the EU.\nCommittee members will meet senior German MEP David McAllister, who is vice president of the European People's Party in the European Parliament, and Danuta Hubner, the chairman of the parliament's Constitutional Affairs Committee.\nCommittee convener Joan McAlpine, an SNP MSP, said there was a \"great deal of concern in Scotland\" about what leaving the single market would mean for the country.\nShe added: \"As Brexit gets closer - Article 50 is expected to be invoked in the next two months - it is vital that we explore all the ramifications of this as well as every possible avenue that helps Scotland retain as close a relationship with the EU and its single market as possible.\"\nDeputy convener and Labour MSP Lewis Macdonald added: \"We're moving into a crucial phase in the run up to Article 50 being triggered, and these meetings will help us understand the implications of Brexit for Scotland on major issues such as citizenship, the economy and trade.\"\nEU leaders have warned that the UK cannot access the single market, which allows the free movement of goods, services and workers between its members, while at the same time restricting the free movement of people - a key pledge of the prime minister.", "Pirelli's deal began in 2011 but it is in competition with Michelin for the new contract that runs from 2017-19.\nSeveral leading teams have expressed a preference for a change because of concerns about Pirelli after a series of problems.\nGoverning body the FIA is also said to have doubts about the Italian company.\nThe FIA had approved both bids on technical and sporting grounds, leaving the decision in the hands of Ecclestone, who puts together the commercial aspects of the deal.\nBut it has now has gone back to Pirelli with further questions following the company's reaction to two high-speed failures at last month's Belgian Grand Prix.\nLeading teams' and drivers' faith in Pirelli has diminished in recent months and there is a widespread concern about whether it is the right company for F1.\n\"There is a number of people making that position clear to Bernie,\" one leading figure said, wishing to remain anonymous.\nPirelli had a meeting at the Italian Grand Prix earlier this month with Ecclestone, leading team bosses and four of the most successful drivers - Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and McLaren's Fernando Alonso.\nIt expressed discomfort at the public criticism from drivers in the wake of the 200mph blow-outs suffered by Rosberg and Vettel in Belgium.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOne source at the meeting said Pirelli was told that \"none of these drivers have any faith in your capabilities as F1's tyre supplier\". The drivers were asked not to express their concerns in public.\nPirelli blamed both incidents at Spa on cuts to the tyre surface and significantly raised minimum tyre pressures, which reduces vulnerability to such failures, for the Italian and Japanese Grands Prix.\nThis means the tyres were run at higher pressures than would be typical or ideal at those races - but teams have argued the tyres should be robust enough to survive the high loads created on those fast circuits without needing to be compromised in that way.\nFollowing his failure in Belgium, Vettel said he thought drivers' concerns were taken seriously, but added: \"What is the answer? Same as every time: 'There was a cut, debris, there may be something wrong with the bodywork, the driver went wide.' Rubbish.\"\nDisquiet about the integrity of the tyre - and Pirelli's response to failures - is combined with the fact most current drivers also dislike the characteristics of the tyres, which cannot be driven on the limit for more than two or three laps at a time.\nInstead, drivers have to manage the rubber carefully to ensure it makes it to the end of the required stint length for the optimum race strategy.\nPirelli says it is producing what F1 has asked for following Ecclestone's request for high-degradation tyres that promote multiple pit stops.\nIt has promised to discuss with drivers, teams and officials whether this remains the right approach.\nOne top driver told BBC Sport: \"We agreed to carry on talking to Pirelli, but that's not the main question. The question is could they produce the tyres we want even if they were asked to?\"\nMany leading engineers told Ecclestone in a meeting earlier this year they believed the current tyres were the best Pirelli could provide.\nMichelin's bid to become the new tyre supplier is based on producing rubber on which drivers can push to the limit throughout the tyre's life.\nIt says it has told Ecclestone it is \"not against\" multiple pit stops or \"using technology to increase the show\".\nInsiders are sceptical as to whether pressure on Ecclestone, who has expressed strong public support for Pirelli, will have any effect.\n\"The contract will go to the highest bidder - that's the way the world works,\" one team boss said.\nPirelli declined to comment.", "The paper shows a picture of local woman Kathleen McBride with the man himself.\nMrs McBride had the chance encounter with the football legend at Buckingham Palace where she received an MBE.\nBecks told her he had enjoyed his time in Coleraine when playing in the Milk Cup.\nAlso in the paper, there's a row brewing up north between unionists.\nThe paper reports that DUP MP Gregory Campbell has urged Jim Allister to \"see the wider picture\" after the TUV leader lodged an uncompromising objection to a new north coast hotel development.\nMr Allister, who owns a home near the site, questioned the need for more hotel beds, however, Mr Campbell said the need was \"unquestionable\".\n\"Don't be a stinker,\" pleads the front page of the Antrim Guardian.

But the stress, according to the seismologists, wasn't just sent north, it was loaded south as well - south of August's event.\nAnd it's in this zone that we have now seen a series of quakes in the past day or so. About a dozen Magnitude fours and fives.\nIt is a zone that would also have been put under pressure as a result of the infamous L'Aquila quake (M6.2) in 2009 which is much further to the south. It has been loaded from both sides.\nDr Richard Walters is affiliated to Britain's Nerc Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes and Tectonics (Comet). He says preliminary models produced by his group and by geophysicists in Italy had all been pointing to similar outcomes.\n\"It is commonly understood that when earthquakes slip, they load the adjacent faults and bring them closer to failure,\" he told BBC News.\n\"It was clear after L'Aquila in 2009 that this southern end of the Laga fault had been loaded, and it's also been brought closer to failure from the stress transfer from the August and October quakes to the north.\n\"It is not a surprise therefore that this area is where the sequence is continuing. It may be that this is it - that things will die down and we will not have another large quake in the foreseeable future. But I'm afraid it's not possible for us to rule out that there will still be another large quake.\"\nUnfortunately, this clustering in space and time is what earthquakes do. And for the Apennines, one of the most beautiful parts of Italy, you just have to look back to 1997 or as far back as 1703 to see that this is the case.\nWhat drives earthquakes in Italy?\nOn the grand scale, Italy's seismic problems are driven by the great collision between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates. But look closer at the specifics of any quake and the details are much more complicated.\nThe Tyrrhenian Basin, or Sea, which lies to the west of Italy, between the mainland and Sardinia/Corsica, is slowly opening up.\nAdd in movement in the Adriatic where the crust is rotating in an anti-clockwise direction, and you have a fiendishly complex picture.\nItaly is literally being pushed and pulled every which way.\nScientists say all this is contributing to extension, or \"pull-apart\", along the Apennines which works at a rate of 3mm per year.", "In two separate cases, three people smugglers have been sentenced after groups of Albanians were brought to England in small boats.\nEighteen were rescued from an inflatable which began sinking a mile-and-a-half off Dymchurch in Kent.\nSeventeen others were discovered on a yacht at Chichester Marina in Sussex.\nA court was told the smugglers at Dymchurch had pleaded guilty to being \"hired boatmen\": men who were paid \u00c2\u00a32,000 to transport the migrants but were not in the direct hierarchy of the smuggling operation.\nSpeaking to the BBC, David Fairclough led both investigations by the Home Office's Immigration Enforcement team.\n\"Organised crime groups work across borders, not just in the UK.
